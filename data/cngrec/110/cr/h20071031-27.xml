FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Since January 2001, the United States economy has lost nearly 3 million jobs in the manufacturing sector alone.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Today, over 7.1 million people in the United States are unemployed, and nearly 1.2 million of those individuals have been unemployed for 6 months or longer.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) While the United States manufacturing sector has been the hardest hit by increased unemployment, the United States service sector has also seen declines as jobs have moved to low-cost labor markets, such as China, India, and the Philippines.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Promoting the economic growth and competitiveness of the United States requires--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) opening substantial new markets for United States goods, services, and farm products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) building a strong framework of rules for international trade to level the playing field for United States workers and businesses in all sectors of the economy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) helping those affected by globalization overcome its challenges and succeed.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Congress created the trade adjustment assistance program in 1962 to provide United States workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition with government-funded training and associated income support to enable such workers to transition to new, good-paying jobs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Unfortunately, the trade adjustment assistance program has not kept pace with globalization and it is failing to ensure that all workers adversely affected by trade receive the assistance they need and deserve.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Workers in the service sector, who make up approximately 80 percent of the United States workforce, are ineligible for trade adjustment assistance.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Inadequate funding for training leaves many dislocated workers without access to the retraining they need to find good-paying jobs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Unnecessary, unduly burdensome, and confusing program eligibility rules prevent workers from gaining access to benefits for which they are eligible.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) The health coverage tax credit suffers from fundamental flaws and, as a result, the credit is not being used by the vast majority of people who are eligible for it, despite a clear need for access to affordable health care.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) To meet the challenges posed by globalization and to preserve the critical role that United States workers play in promoting the strength and prosperity of the United States, the trade adjustment assistance program must be reformed.</narrative>

FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Since January 2001, the United States economy has lost nearly 3 million jobs in the manufacturing sector alone.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Today, over 7.1 million people in the United States are unemployed, and nearly 1.2 million of those individuals have been unemployed for 6 months or longer.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) While the United States manufacturing sector has been the hardest hit by increased unemployment, the United States service sector has also seen declines as jobs have moved to low-cost labor markets, such as China, India, and the Philippines.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Promoting the economic growth and competitiveness of the United States requires--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) opening substantial new markets for United States goods, services, and farm products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) building a strong framework of rules for international trade to level the playing field for United States workers and businesses in all sectors of the economy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) helping those affected by globalization overcome its challenges and succeed.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Congress created the trade adjustment assistance program in 1962 to provide United States workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition with government-funded training and associated income support to enable such workers to transition to new, good-paying jobs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Unfortunately, the trade adjustment assistance program has not kept pace with globalization and it is failing to ensure that all workers adversely affected by trade receive the assistance they need and deserve.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Workers in the service sector, who make up approximately 80 percent of the United States workforce, are ineligible for trade adjustment assistance.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Inadequate funding for training leaves many dislocated workers without access to the retraining they need to find good-paying jobs.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Unnecessary, unduly burdensome, and confusing program eligibility rules prevent workers from gaining access to benefits for which they are eligible.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) The health coverage tax credit suffers from fundamental flaws and, as a result, the credit is not being used by the vast majority of people who are eligible for it, despite a clear need for access to affordable health care.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) To meet the challenges posed by globalization and to preserve the critical role that United States workers play in promoting the strength and prosperity of the United States, the trade adjustment assistance program must be reformed.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="TITLE VI--WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to our distinguished subcommittee chairman for Trade, Mr. Levin, I first want to thank Mr. McCrery for helping to set the stage for at least the Ways and Means Committee to vote unanimously for the free trade agreement with Peru. This was a record vote, this was a historic vote, and we had every vote on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I raise that at this time not to curry favor with the Republicans to support this historic piece of legislation before us, but because I know from Mr. McCrery's input and contribution, he recognizes that trade no longer has to be seen as something that is negative to American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good trade agreements that create jobs should be allowed a vote and not be hurried so that Members are not impeded from the policy and really have an opportunity to study the substance. Without his cooperation and that of the United States Trade Representative and Secretary Treasurer, we would not even have the opportunity to look forward to the bipartisan victory we had in the committee and look forward to on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A part of that agreement, however, was he and I sharing that when people are without work, without jobs, without hope, when communities are adversely affected because of trade, that our government and our multinationals have a responsibility not just to their shareholders, but to do all that they can to ease the pain, to encourage investment, and to have a climate, whether it is globalization or technology, to know that trade is not always the villain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to the extent we are able to improve on many of the things that we have in this bill before us, we do hope that the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act will be just the beginning. That whether it is trade or not, we have a responsibility to the dignity of American workers and their children so that in this great country they can aspire to be working and to have the respect that all Americans would want in terms of being producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to the extent that we had the cooperation of Mr. McCrery in creating the climate, and fully appreciating that we had input from Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee, even though we didn't ask for their votes and accept their amendments, it is this climate that makes our country so great, that makes this Congress so great, and makes me proud to be the Chair and a member of the Ways and Means Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We come here today at a crossroads of sorts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, trade policy has been a dividing force, used as a political tool to advance ideologies, rather than a shared sense of purpose that our trade agreements and programs could reflect the broader goals of the American worker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today offers an opportunity to change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early months of this Congress, I joined with the Speaker and the House leadership to remind the Administration that the Constitution specifically designates Congress as the branch of government responsible for international commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We agreed that we took that responsibility seriously and we would use our majority to improve American trade policy to better reflect the needs and concerns of our workers, not just our large, multi-national corporations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today is the next step in developing a new trade policy that more adequately addresses the growing perception that trade is not working for American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007 would expand training and benefits for workers while also helping to encourage investment in communities that have lost jobs to increased trade--particularly in our manufacturing sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The growing perception that prior American trade policy ignored the needs of workers here and abroad is a large contributing factor to the declining public support for trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years we have had a program in place--trade adjustment assistance, or TAA--that was supposed to tackle some of the issues and problems workers face as it relates to trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the best of intentions, this program did not meet expectations or promises and has failed to keep pace with globalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here to change that today with the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today is a comprehensive policy expanding opportunities for American  workers, industries, and communities to prepare for and overcome the challenges created by expanded trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill significantly expands existing TAA for Workers by: 1) covering service workers and additional manufacturing workers; 2) increasing TAA benefits; 3) making the TAA wage insurance program permanent; 4) improving the TAA health care benefit; and 5) increasing TAA program funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill includes a package of tax incentives to encourage investment in distressed communities that have lost manufacturing jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, recognizing that unemployment insurance (UI) is the gateway to TAA, the bill reforms the unemployment insurance system by creating incentives for States to cover part-time, low-wage, and other workers under State UI laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's ability to compete and win in a global economy is too critical for our trade policy to continue being a partisan issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I noticed with great displeasure yesterday's veto threat from the Administration on this bill. To that statement, I would say that the bill before us today passed the Ways and Means Committee with Democratic and Republican support--and I expect it will receive the same from the full House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issues contained in this bill are central to the ongoing debate over the Administration's trade policy and if this Administration wishes to address the growing public concern over the direction of its trade policy, it will reconsider this veto threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Globalization is here to stay--and we must band together as Democrats and Republicans to shape its benefits for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to today's discussion and I urge you to support <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I would like unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade, who has played such an important role in creating that climate and working with the staff and the members on the other side.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE VI--WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I return the compliment to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for helping to create an atmosphere on our committee which has allowed us to make great progress in the area of trade, as evidenced by today's 39-0 vote in favor of advancing the Peru Free Trade Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman and I have talked many times this year about the need to have a more viable assistance program or network of programs at the Federal level as well as in the private sector to assist workers in our country who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, who lose their jobs because of trade or because of globalization more generally. The chairman has been very good at listening to our suggestions from the minority and considering those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the bill that is before the House today does not reflect any of our suggestions or proposals that we have shared with the majority; and that's unfortunate, although I have been assured by the chairman that as this bill works its way through the rest of the process, our ideas may yet receive consideration and perhaps inclusion. So I remain hopeful of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the bill that is before us today does not contain those and it contains, I think, a number of weaknesses which compel me to not support the bill that is before the House today but instead to support a substitute which I will offer later in the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In talking about the majority bill that's on the floor today as a threshold matter, and the chairman knows this because I have talked with him about it, I think we should be considering trade adjustment assistance, unemployment insurance, modification of those programs in the context of trade opportunities generally for United States workers, farmers and businesses. That is to say, I think we should be considering modifications to our assistance network in the context of the pending free trade  agreements that are before the Congress and the expired trade promotion authority. Unfortunately, we are not doing that. We are considering TAA in isolation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The alternative that I offer today would reauthorize trade adjustment assistance for 5 years. To help workers gain the skills needed to adapt to the changing global economy, our bill would restructure TAA from a predominantly income support program that offers training into a job retraining program that improves access to more flexible training and continues to provide income support, health care, and other benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contrasts between the substitute I will offer and <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, the bill on the floor, are quite stark. For example, <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> would pointlessly keep people in trade adjustment assistance longer. Our substitute would provide more flexible training options to get people back to work sooner, including by training before layoff and training part-time and giving people training scholarships to use over 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> would increase TAA spending by billions of dollars, but would not require any further accountability on how program funds are spent. Our bill introduces some elements of accountability in that spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> would greatly expand TAA and, I think, exacerbate the inefficiencies in the program today. Our bill would better integrate TAA and other Federal programs to make more services available to all workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> would extend benefits to public sector workers and submit State and local officials to subpoenas and legal proceedings to comply. Our bill would maintain the focus of the program on private sector workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> would greatly expand the health coverage tax credit, but then terminate that credit in 2 years. I don't know exactly why the majority chose to terminate this health care tax credit in 2 years. They have, in way of explanation, said that they think the current way the tax credit is structured may not be the best way to do it so they may use these 2 years to come up with another plan. That may be; but the fact is that the bill terminates the health care tax credit in 2 years. They also  increase the credit from 65 percent to 85 percent which I believe is not warranted. Our substitute would increase the credit from 65 percent to 70 percent, and would continue that credit for the entire 5-year life of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other differences. One that we think is notable is the new markets tax credit that we would expand. We think that is a more efficient way to address communities that have been directly impacted by trade. The tax credit bonds in the majority bill we think are untested. They could be subject to abuse and uses that are not really related to impacts of trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to express my clear opposition to how the majority pays for the $10 billion cost of their bill. First, they would delay interest allocation rules that this Congress enacted in 2004. We did that to address an unfairness for American companies that do business overseas. The effect of delaying the application of that change that we made would be to make United States companies less competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, they would unnecessarily, in our view, increase Federal unemployment payroll taxes by extending the 0.2 percent FUTA surtax that is due to expire at the end of this year for another 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret that this bill does not reflect what I hoped to be our bipartisan approach to trade adjustment assistance or to our trade agenda beyond the Peru FTA, and I reluctantly will oppose it and support the substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="TITLE VI--WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the typical income of American households has actually declined between 2002 and 2006 in inflation-adjusted terms. Last year, the number of Americans without health insurance actually increased by over 2 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years now, Americans have had to deal with stagnating incomes and rising costs for basics like health care, food, energy and housing. For many reasons, Americans are deeply concerned about the future of their economy and their place in it. One cause of  their concern is the negative consequences they see from international trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Americans find themselves increasingly caught in the crosshairs of the global economy. They have watched neighbors, friends and loved ones lose their jobs when plants close and move overseas. Americans have become even more skeptical about trade agreements, and for good reason. They have watched jobs move to China, and in return they get lead-poisoned toys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given these very real concerns, it is critical that we include in trade agreements strong and enforceable labor and environmental protections. And we must provide substantial assistance to workers who are negatively affected by this trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the first part, I want to thank the committee for what they have done in terms of the trade agreements with these labor and environmental protections and I want to thank them for this legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation we are considering addresses this very important point of what happens to those workers who have the negative consequences of international trade. This legislation helps ensure that displaced workers can help make ends meet while they find a new job, or in the case of older workers, until they reach retirement age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires a layoff or plant closing notification if 50 or more employees, including part-time employees, at a single job site are laid off in a 30-day period. It eliminates a loophole that has allowed employers to avoid giving notices by shifting employees around job sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill increases notice to employees of a plant closing or mass layoff from 60 to 90 days, and that is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it also says that TAA-eligible employees can extend their COBRA coverage for as long as they remain TAA-eligible, up to 2 1/2  years. And TAA-eligible employees who are 55 years or older and who have worked for an employer for more than 10 years can extend their COBRA coverage until they are eligible for Medicare at age 65, or covered by another health care plan. The coverage is available to workers today, but only up to 18 months. The bill extends that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the most important provision for those workers who lose their income and lose their job, trying to hold their families together, and also see the loss of their health care. COBRA is of no cost to the government. The employee must pay the employer share, the employee share, and the 2 percent administrative cost. Over 40 million Americans have used COBRA coverage. But in any given year, only 2 to 3 million Americans are on the program, and close to 200,000 people are losing that coverage  every month. This is an important benefit to these workers and certainly to people who have preexisting conditions and know they will not be able to go in and find insurance that they can afford or that is even available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we make certain that these older workers are able to bridge the time until they reach Medicare eligibility so they will have continuity of health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is good legislation. I hope my colleagues on the floor will support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="TITLE VI--WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume in opposition to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us is supposed to be about reforming the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. As flawed as the underlying TAA provisions are, their weaknesses are amplified by the inclusion of separate, largely unrelated legislation that moved through the Education and Labor Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill, which has been folded into the larger TAA package, modifies the WARN Act and COBRA, two statutes that were not even designed to help workers impacted by globalization get the tools and training they needed to get back to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've heard time and again that in order to effectively respond to competitive challenges we need to bolster our education and training systems to better prepare current and future workers for success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the provisions inserted into the broader TAA bill take a different approach. Instead of offering proactive solutions that will allow American workers to compete and thrive, these policies do nothing more than layer on additional Federal red tape for employers while offering only incremental provisions for workers that would do nothing to help them adjust to the changing workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal for a massive expansion of the WARN Act would be incredibly burdensome for employers struggling to keep pace with a changing economy. The limitations of this proposal do not match the real-world scenarios in which employers may be shifting their workforce to meet changing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill mandates a full 90 days' notice before a plant closure or other mass layoff, requiring employers to remain stagnant for a full fiscal quarter before adjusting their workforce. This, despite the fact that in order to keep and create jobs here at home, employers need a workforce that is flexible and adaptable. Layered on top of that unworkable time frame is a requirement that double damages be paid by any employer unable to comply. This would create a system that is more focused on punishing  employers than truly helping workers who lose their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, the selective expansion of COBRA availability seems to focus more on compliance and red tape than on offering genuine solutions to workers who need assistance and retraining as a result of globalization. It creates an unfair system in which not all workers who lose their jobs would have access to the same health care options. The bill uses TAA eligibility as a trigger for expanded COBRA coverage but extends the coverage almost indefinitely. This is inconsistent with existing COBRA  eligibility and inconsistent with other TAA benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Education and Labor Committee convened a hearing in March to examine the impact of international trade on American workers. The challenges we considered during that hearing are the same challenges we appear to be attempting to address today. Yet during that hearing, not a single witness suggested or endorsed these bloated, bureaucratic WARN Act and COBRA proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that American companies must be flexible and dynamic in order to keep pace with their competition overseas. These proposals would put American companies at a distinct disadvantage, preventing them from maintaining an agile workforce and undermining efforts to preserve American jobs or create new ones because of the burden and cost of compliance with these new mandates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we're serious about assisting dislocated workers and keeping America competitive, the Education and Labor Committee has a crucial role to play. We should be renewing our one-stop job training system authorized under the Workforce Investment Act. Unfortunately, Democrats have stalled our efforts to strengthen and improve job training, failing to even introduce a bill to extend and enhance WIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans are committed to keeping America competitive in the global economy. Later today, I will join with Representative McCrery, the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, to offer a comprehensive approach to assist Americans adversely affected by trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increased employer burdens proposed through an expansion of the WARN Act and COBRA are nothing more than a distraction from the real debate we ought to be having. I oppose these costly, arduous provisions because they move in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of fostering competitiveness and job creation, they will breed litigation and stagnation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the President is going to negotiate trade agreements based on the failed NAFTA model, this legislation is the very least that we can do for our workers who lose their jobs because of international trade and globalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America faces record high trade deficits and plant closings, and it's our laid-off workers who are the casualties. Strengthening trade adjustment assistance, TAA, isn't the  magic pill. It is not the cure-all. It can only be a help by fixing the flawed trade policy. We will do what our workers need, but we owe displaced workers in the meantime, and we owe their communities around the country the chance they need to regain their economic  footing with job training, with health care, and they need to know that it's available to them and how to take advantage of these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the bill will not prevent millions of workers from losing their jobs, it will give them the tools they need and the tools they deserve until they are once again able to compete in the global workforce.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield now to the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions ranking member, with jurisdiction over COBRA, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) for such time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="TITLE VI--WORKER ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to this legislation, Mr. Speaker. I have been and continue to be a major proponent of trade, but this Trade Adjustment Assistance program that we have today has, seems to me, gone astray. There are a number of reasons why I would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, from the massive expansion of what was intended to be a targeted Trade Adjustment Assistance program to the dramatic increase in litigation and liability employers will face under the WARN Act provisions contained  in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from California mentioned COBRA eligibility in his remarks. I'd like to talk about that for just a minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the law as it stands today, when a worker loses his or her job, he or she is generally able to elect to continue health care coverage under COBRA for 18, or sometimes as long as 36, months. This balances the legitimate need of the workers to obtain gap or bridge health insurance coverage, while recognizing the administrative needs of employers and, in particular, the need for employers who voluntarily offer health benefits to manage costs and risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us dramatically expands COBRA benefits for certain classes of workers potentially at the expense of others. Under the Rangel substitute, a worker who loses his or her job "because of trade" is afforded significantly more COBRA rights than an employee who simply loses his or her job because, for example, his employer closes shop. Indeed, for some of these workers, expansion of COBRA rights can last for decades, plainly not what was intended under the original law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes provisions extending COBRA benefits for PBGC beneficiaries without any regard to the issue of trade. Individuals pay for COBRA, but because of the nature of how this was put together, the provisions are paid for through an increase in the taxpayer-funded health care tax credit, at least through the period of TAA eligibility, again, extending and complicating it in a way that was never intended in the original law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a couple of more things that come under the WARN provision of this. This bill expands the WARN Act coverage to apply to businesses which employ 100 or more employees, including part-time workers. It expands the definitions of plant closures and mass layoffs. It increases the notice requirements so that employers must provide 90 days' notice of an intended plant closure or mass layoff. It expands damages for lost wages and benefits to include double wages, benefits and interest for up to  90 calendar days. It includes new requirements that employers post notice of WARN Act requirements and information on how to file a complaint and provide notice of benefits and services available to employees. It expands enforcement to allow the Secretary of Labor to investigate alleged violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of these are probably very worthwhile, but clearly, a tremendous expansion and opportunity for almost unlimited litigation, placing a very large burden on employers, and I don't think we want to do that at a time when we're trying to preserve jobs for our employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I oppose this legislation. It reaches too far. It is too complicated. It opens up employers to too much litigation. We can do better than this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, you're 6 months away from your 58th birthday, and the place where you have worked for 25 years closes and you have no health insurance. So you dip into your savings and you figure out a way to keep yourself in the plan that you were in by paying for it largely with your own money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under present law, when you hit your 59th birthday, if you don't have another job with health insurance, you're out, and you have got 6 years to go until you qualify for Medicare. We are changing that in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's what this bill says. That person I just described, if they can figure out a way to stretch their savings and stretch their dollars until they're 65 years old, can enroll in Medicare and never have a gap where their family is left unprotected, with their own money by and large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the credits that are generously extended here, we wish we could do more, but this is a program that makes common sense for the person who is too young to retire and too old to start all over again.

    <paragraph>In 2004, Maytag Refrigeration Products in Galesburg, Illinois, closed its  doors and bolted for Sonora, Mexico, displacing 1,600 workers, all innocent victims of a bad trade policy.

It provides workers with sufficient notice of mass layoffs, improves the processes by which workers obtain training, and strengthens access to affordable health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to see the inclusion of two of my provisions in the bill: one that would require the Department of Labor to inform workers about the availability of counseling and early access to training services, and another to help displaced workers get additional financing aid for training.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the real answer to growing job loss in the United States, the declining value of our dollar and to rising trade deficits is to balance America's trade accounts by renegotiating failed deals like NAFTA and China PNTR, by not passing any more of them, by opening closed markets like Japan's and China's, and Korea's and by stopping unfair trade practices globally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, our workers continue to take the big hits by losing their jobs and benefits. What this bill does is it gives them increased notice when their plants are going to close, and it also provides a landing pad in the form of training and trade adjustment assistance. I just wish that the jobs they are being trained for would be produced. We know that often is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the absolute least we can do for the people of our country. They have paid the price of our failure here in Washington to produce economic policies that make America's economy robust.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This bill gives them some help--by giving them increased notice before their plants are closed, and it revamps trade assistance and training to help them reposition if the jobs exist in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to our workers and communities to give them a better chance to adjust. They are the casualties of economic policy here in Washington that is not working. This legislation will require employers to provide 90 days of notice in the event of a proposed plant closing or layoff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trigger the notification requirements if at least 25 workers lose their jobs during any 30-day period, not 50 workers as in current legislation;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mandate notice if 100 or more workers are laid off at multiple plants or worksites during any 30-day period;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cover both full-time and part-time hourly and salaried workers;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Require the Department of Labor to provide model educational information to employers on employer responsibilities and employee rights under WARN, as well as benefits and services available to dislocated workers;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorize the Department of Labor to investigate complaints and bring enforcement suits and also to notify Members of Congress who represent the affected areas;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Permit employees to recover back pay and benefits up to 90 days and also liquidated damages (doubling the compensation otherwise available) if an employer fails to give the required notice under the act; and,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Important to note is the legislation's extension of the period for COBRA (comprehensive benefits, including health care) coverage for recipients of trade adjustment assistance. Under current COBRA rules, workers who lose their jobs generally may continue their health benefits for up to 18 months at their own expense. The new legislation would give workers who are 55 years or older and have worked for an employer for 10 or more years the option to elect COBRA coverage until they become Medicare  eligible at 65 or until they obtain health coverage through a subsequent employer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support this bill, we must keep in mind that TAA and WARN aren't substitutes for jobs in manufacturing America. An America that does not produce not only loses the most vibrant wealth-producing sector of her economy but her defense and industrial base as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TAA and WARN should be used sparingly and for the short term--they are band-aids, not solutions. We need to pass legislation requiring the executive branch to balance our trade accounts, to renegotiate NAFTA/PNTR, and to open closed markets of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that we are voting on TAA today, to increase votes for the Peru Free Trade Agreement next week. Our willingness to sell out our Nation's workforce for the consolation prize of trade adjustment assistance promises to damage our country for decades to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have two bills--H. Res. 336 and <bill type="h" number="169">H.R. 169</bill>, the Balancing Trade Act, which will get our country back on the right track. By supporting <bill type="hr" number="336">H. Res. 336</bill>, we support fair, people-centered principles that promote free trade only among free peoples. The Balancing Trade Act, which already enjoys bipartisan support, demands that the President acknowledge a problem in our trade policy when our deficit with any one country exceeds $10 billion for more than 3 years. I also have a bill (<bill type="h" number="1958">H.R. 1958</bill>) to revoke  PNTR from China, and I will be introducing a bill to require the President to renegotiate NAFTA. These bills are steps towards correcting our U.S. trade policy to prevent the kinds of layoffs and job loss that these bills merely ice over.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Tiffin Workers Discover Limits of WARN Act</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Steve Eder and James Drew)</narrative>
  <narrative>TIFFIN.--Four days after Christmas in 2001, Gene Goshe braved the brisk cold as he walked to his newspaper box and unrolled his copy of the Tiffin Advertiser-Tribune.</narrative>
  <narrative>"National shutting down," blared the headline in tall letters across the front page.</narrative>
  <narrative>In seconds, Mr. Goshe's life changed forever.</narrative>
  <narrative>After devoting 33 years of his life to the National Machinery Co., Mr. Goshe read in the newspaper that morning that the plant had abruptly closed. He didn't get a phone call to let him know he no longer had a job.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It was like a snowball hit you in the hind end on the first of January," recalled Mr. Goshe, then 58. "This is the way we are going to start the year."</narrative>
  <narrative>The sudden demise of National Machinery stunned Tiffin, a town of 17,000 about 55 miles southeast of Toledo already reeling from plant closings and layoffs.</narrative>
  <narrative>The plant, a few blocks from the small downtown, made the machines that made nuts and bolts since the 1880s. But while the products of its machines embodied the ordinary, the storied history of National Machinery was far from typical.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The National"--as locals affectionately called it--provided a choice working environment for generations in and around Seneca County, a flat, fertile part of northwest Ohio dotted with fields and woodlots.</narrative>
  <narrative>The company's reputation as an exceptional employer was rooted in its traditions--a club for employees who had worked there at least 25 years, summer picnics at Cedar Point, and Christmas parties at the fancy Ritz Theatre.</narrative>
  <narrative>National Machinery was like family, workers recalled. Not surprisingly, it was begun by Tiffin's first families--the Frosts and Kalnows, whose ownership dates to the 1880s, when patriarch Meshech Frost convinced the company's original owner to move its operations to Tiffin.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Frosts, and later the Kalnows, are recognized as Tiffin's leading community boosters, using some of their vast fortune to support local causes and institutions, including the city's Heidelberg College, where the families set up scholarship programs to benefit the children of National Machinery employees.</narrative>
  <narrative>The bond between the privately held company and its workers changed forever on Dec. 28, 2001--the date National shut down.</narrative>
  <narrative>For most of the 549 National Machinery Co. employees, there was no notice the place where many of them had dedicated their working lives was closing.</narrative>
  <narrative>Paul Aley, National Machinery's president, explained to workers in a letter dated the day the plant closed that banks cut off the company's money because of its financial troubles. Most employees didn't receive Mr. Aley's letter until they had already read about National's demise in the newspaper or heard about it from friends or co-workers.</narrative>
  <narrative>In 1988, Congress passed a law requiring business owners to give 60-days notice before a plant closing or mass layoff. If National Machinery Co. had followed the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known as the WARN Act, its employees could have begun looking for new work and putting their finances in order instead of dealing with the shock of suddenly losing their jobs.</narrative>
  <narrative>There were concerns about the well-being of National Machinery Co. leading up to its closure. Citing financial problems, the company announced some layoffs earlier in 2001 and gave most of its workers the holidays off without pay. But the veteran workers expected business would pick back up as it had many times over the years.</narrative>
  <narrative>This time wasn't like the others.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the weeks and months after National Machinery's shutdown, employees looked to their faith for strength.</narrative>
  <narrative>Twice a week, employees such as Mr. Goshe, a Vietnam veteran and father of four, would gather outside the plant at noon and form a prayer circle with 50 to 75 people. In the cold January and February air, they would pray for each other and for the future of National Machinery Co.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Everybody would go around and if anybody had something to say, they'd say it, or they would say a prayer," Mr. Goshe said. "If anybody had anything they wanted to get off their chest, they could get it off their chest."</narrative>
  <narrative>The workers took pride in their roles in National Machinery's history and held out hope for a return to better times.</narrative>
  <narrative>"National Machinery had the knowledge in town that they were the best employer in Seneca County," said Mark Griffin, a 38-year employee. "We had some other big employers in Seneca County, but that was the best place to work.</narrative>
  <narrative>"They took care of their people, they had a fair wage, you worked your overtime, had a great retirement, and they took care of you," Mr. Griffin said.</narrative>
  <narrative>From its Quarter Century Club, which honored employees of 25 years, to its picnics, baseball leagues, and community service, National Machinery was steeped in tradition.</narrative>
  <narrative>Its owners, the Frosts and Kalnows, who for decades referred to their employees as "Our people," instilled an unapologetic sense of family in and outside the plant.</narrative>
  <narrative>They provided quality employment, fair wages, and steady jobs, and in return they expected their workers to live up to National Machinery standards to protect the image of the company. Employees in the 1970s and '80s were expected to be clean-cut and trouble-free. They were forbidden from cashing their checks at local watering holes.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Griffin said National Machinery employees had enough pride in their work to cash their checks at a bank, not at a bar.</narrative>
  <narrative>In return, Mr. Griffin said, "If you got into trouble or were a little short, they would always bring the money up ahead of you. They would pick you up and you could pay 'em back later. It was like a family thing."</narrative>
  <narrative>National Machinery began four generations of ownership by the Frost and then Kalnow families soon after Meshech Frost convinced Bill Anderson to move the company to Tiffin in 1882.</narrative>
  <narrative>In Tiffin, there is much folklore about National Machinery and its family ownership.</narrative>
  <narrative>One tale is that Mr. Frost went to New York City to get a loan from financier "Diamond" Jim Brady to help purchase the company.</narrative>
  <narrative>After his death in 1922, Mr. Frost left the company to his son, Earl Frost, who ran it into the 1950s. Earl Frost's daughter, Jane Frost, who was the heiress to the family fortune, married Carl Kalnow, a banker, and together they owned National Machinery  Co.</narrative>
  <narrative>National Machinery employees still fondly recall the story behind the Frost-Kalnow engagement.</narrative>
  <narrative>"From what I know, Mr. Kalnow came to town and he got off the train and asked who the richest man in town was and if he had a daughter," Mr. Griffin said. "It was Miss Frost and he ended up marrying her."</narrative>
  <narrative>The Kalnows had four children--Carl, Andrew, Gertrude, and Loretta--who inherited National Machinery after their mother's death in 1986.</narrative>
  <narrative>In 1998, the Kalnow siblings--who were raised in Tiffin but had moved away--sold the company for $98 million to Citicorp Venture Capital, a New York-based firm that buys and sells companies as investments.</narrative>
  <narrative>Within three years, National Machinery rapidly declined from a thriving company to an abruptly shuttered one.</narrative>
  <narrative>After National Machinery closed, the Kalnow siblings--who had kept a seat on the company's board of directors and a 15 percent stake in the business as part of the sale--became the workers' best hope for rescuing the company.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the weeks after the company closed its doors, the Kalnows, led by Andrew Kalnow, founder of Chicago-based Alpha Capital Partners, a private equity investment firm, began negotiating to buy National Machinery's debt from a consortium of banks holding tens of millions of dollars in notes--the debt taken on to buy the company from him and his family.</narrative>
  <narrative>In February, 2002, the Kalnows repurchased National Machinery for $16 million, just a fraction of what they had sold it for just three years earlier.</narrative>
  <narrative>In Tiffin, many employees believed their prayers were answered.</narrative>
  <narrative>But they soon learned that National Machinery, under its new ownership, would be a far different company than the one they had devoted 20, 30, or even 40 years of their lives.</narrative>
  <narrative>In a complex business transaction, the Kalnows established National Machinery LLC, or limited liability company, which they used to essentially purchase the property and assets of the former National Machinery Co.</narrative>
  <narrative>The sale was completed in such a way that the new company would inherit the old company's headquarters in Tiffin, its factory, its machinery, and its customers. But it would have no responsibility to pay the debts of the old company. Those debts included millions of dollars owed to suppliers and $1.5 million more owed to area doctors and health-care facilities for medical services provided to former employees before the plant closed.</narrative>
  <narrative>Officials of the new company eventually agreed to pay an undisclosed amount toward the $1.5 million in medical bills owed by former plant workers. But the new company said it had no legal obligation to the employees of the "old company," who were left behind when the plant closed in December, 2001.</narrative>
  <narrative>A spokesman for National Machinery LLC last week said WARN Act issues were handled by the former plant owner and their lawyers.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Like many other companies today facing the challenge of being successful in a highly competitive world market, National Machinery LLC is leaner and less vertically integrated," said John Bolte, senior vice president of operations and human resources. "Many processes and therefore jobs from the past simply do not exist in our company in order to make us more competitive."</narrative>
  <narrative>Attempts by The Blade to interview Andrew Kalnow and his siblings were unsuccessful.</narrative>
  <narrative>In an e-mail from Mr. Kalnow last month, he told The Blade: "It seems like you have a politics agenda in mind that has nothing to do with our business and contribution to the community."</narrative>
  <narrative>The Kalnows' "new company"--National Machinery LLC--in the spring of 2002 hired nearly 240 full-time employees after it reopened the plant, many of whom worked for the "old company."</narrative>
  <narrative>But many of National Machinery Co.'s 549 employees, including some of its longest-tenured workers, such as Joe Poignon, never received the call to come back.</narrative>
  <narrative>"They started it back up, but they excluded us," said Mr. Poignon, a 40-year employee who worked in the company's after-market section. "There was people who weren't retired out there who had more than 25 years of service and they were not called back."</narrative>
  <narrative>Some grew bitter, angry, and depressed as they waited and waited for the call from National Machinery that never came.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It's the way they treated us," said Mr. Poignon, who tries to avoid Greenfield Street in Tiffin, where National Machinery is located. "Not calling us in to inform us of anything, and not being up front and square with us, and being ostracized after they reopened the plant. None of us deserve that. After we have given our lives to it, our good working years are gone. We can't go out and restart. We gave them all our good working years."</narrative>
  <narrative>He added, "You feel like you've been betrayed."</narrative>
  <narrative>Several former National Machinery employees fell into depression as they tried to live without the work they had been doing for most of their lives.</narrative>
  <narrative>Others were angry.</narrative>
  <narrative>Paul Martorana, a 27-year employee of National Machinery, returned to the company's offices to settle his pension after the new company had taken over. But before he left, he had a request of Anne Martin, the company's secretary.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Would you do me one favor?" Mr. Martorana recalled asking. "Take my picture off the wall. I don't want anyone to know I was ever associated with this company."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Martorana wanted his picture taken off the walls of National Machinery Co.'s Quarter Century Club. The club, which had more than 735 members since it was established in 1936, honored the company's most loyal employees.</narrative>
  <narrative>Many members of that devoted club were among those who were unexpectedly thrown from their jobs, instantly losing health-care coverage, paychecks, accrued vacation time, and the stability of employment.</narrative>
  <narrative>"A lot of people got hurt, financially and mentally," Mr. Martorana said.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We didn't know what to do," Mr. Poignon said. "There were people who were scheduled for surgery. They didn't know what to do. They didn't have insurance. Some of them had cancer."</narrative>
  <narrative>It was difficult, if not impossible, for some former employees to find reliable work after decades with National Machinery. The employees had no time to plan, find new jobs, or train for new careers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Out of necessity, some took whatever they could find, accepting steep pay cuts and losing benefits.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It's basically turned our lives upside down," said Sharon Goshe, who has been married to Gene Goshe for 34 years.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Goshe said he held out hope for about three months after the plant closed, hoping that he would get a call to return to work. The call never came.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Once they opened back up and [I'd] seen the ones they were hiring back, I was too old," Mr. Goshe said.</narrative>
  <narrative>He began applying for nearly "any job that was in the paper," but he didn't have any success and began to suffer from depression.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The unemployment was running out, and we got the same old stories," he said. "You go out and you look for a job and you get your hopes up, and you hear nothing."</narrative>
  <narrative>Ten months after National closed, Mr. Goshe took a job for $10 an hour with no benefits at a local lumber yard, a $4 an hour wage cut.</narrative>
  <narrative>Many employees of National Machinery skipped their paid vacations over the years, believing they had accrued months of paid time off that could be used in the future. When the old company shuttered, employees were not reimbursed for the time.</narrative>
  <narrative>The workers said they were also owed thousands of dollars in lost wages and unpaid medical bills. But when they went to the plant office and tried to collect from National Machinery LLC, they heard a familiar refrain: "Sue the old company."</narrative>
  <narrative>But the "old company" no longer existed.</narrative>
  <narrative>On Sept. 11, 2002, three former workers of National Machinery Co.--Chad and Donald Baker and Paul Martorana--filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court in Toledo on behalf of all the workers who lost their jobs.</narrative>
  <narrative>They sued National Machinery Co., Citicorp Venture Capital, and two related entities claiming the WARN Act was violated when the plant closed without a 60-day notice. They asked for lost wages, vacation pay, and medical expenses they said they were owed, totaling at least $4,000 per worker.</narrative>
  <narrative>They received a quick education into the limitations and loopholes of the federal law.</narrative>
  <narrative>But the biggest obstacle they faced was the wall of legal agreements, contracts, and documents set up by a squad of lawyers to make sure that National Machinery LLC was not responsible for the debts and actions of National Machinery Co.</narrative>
  <narrative>Attorneys for Citicorp Venture Capital argued that their client wasn't the liable employer under the law because even though Citicorp was the majority owner of the "old company," it didn't make business decisions on behalf of National Machinery.</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the "old company" was now a mere shell, its former employees fell into one of the most prominent pitfalls of the WARN Act--finding someone who could pay the workers what they were owed.</narrative>
  <narrative>Nearly three years after the company closed, attorneys for the employees and Citicorp Venture Capital agreed to a settlement that would pay $375 per worker before taxes--just pennies on the dollar of what most employees felt they were owed. National Machinery LLC, as a completely new entity, had no obligation to the workers and was not involved in the settlement.</narrative>
  <narrative>Calling the settlement an "insult" and frustrated with the law, 74 former National Machinery employees wrote the judge to object to the settlement.</narrative>
  <narrative>"There were a lot of very good employees that were completely devastated when all this happened and some satisfaction needs to be given to all of us," Virginia Coffman wrote. Mrs. Coffman, along with her husband, John Coffman, worked for National Machinery Co. for more than 28 years. "This type of treatment cannot be allowed to go unnoticed and just slide by, it has hurt many responsible people who are still trying to recover."</narrative>
  <narrative>In a handwritten note, Steven Webster, a former National Machinery employee from Upper Sandusky, Ohio, explained that the company's sudden closing triggered a financial tailspin that caused him to fall behind on child-support payments. Mr. Webster explained that he needed to withdraw from his 401K plan twice to keep banks from foreclosing on his home.</narrative>
  <narrative>"For the six months I was without a job. I had my water, electric, and gas shut off and had to live with my mother for a while until I got a job because I couldn't afford food or anything," Mr. Webster wrote.</narrative>
  <narrative>Many of the workers sent copies of their letters to their representatives in Congress and the Statehouse, including U.S. Rep. Paul Gillmor (R., Tiffin), U.S. Sens. George Voinovich and Mike DeWine, then-Gov. Bob Taft, and state Rep. Jeff Wagner (R., Sycamore).</narrative>
  <narrative>None of them was willing to fight for their constituents, at least on the WARN Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>On Nov. 15, 2004. a group of former National Machinery Co. employees went to federal court in Toledo to object in person to the proposed settlement.</narrative>
  <narrative>On their day in court, U.S. District Judge James Carr empathized with the plight of the workers, inviting them to sit in the jury box and address the court. But the judge all but told the workers that his judicial powers were limited by a law with no teeth.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the end, Judge Carr reluctantly approved the settlement, declaring it a "pittance" and telling angry workers it was the best settlement they could hope for under the weak federal law.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Most simply put, and most unhappily, you're out of luck," Judge Carr told the workers. "That statute has proven to be no protection to you."</narrative>
  <narrative>In Tiffin, more than five years after the "old company" suddenly was closed on a cold December day, time has healed some of the wounds. But there still remains an undercurrent of regret and bitterness.</narrative>
  <narrative>Today there's a sign outside the headquarters of National Machinery LLC that proudly proclaims it as a 130-year-old company.</narrative>
  <narrative>The former employees never called back by the "new company" say the sign epitomizes the hypocrisy of what transpired at National Machinery.</narrative>
  <narrative>"What I've heard is they think they've done great--`they've saved the company,' " Mr. Poignon said. "You don't want to think that the place you've worked your entire life has done something terrible. They didn't fulfill their promises to a lot of people who gave their whole lives to the company."</narrative>
  <narrative>The laid-off workers have struggled to come to terms with the fact that National Machinery LLC--which conducts its business from the old headquarters of National Machinery Co. in Tiffin, builds the same machines, and serves the same set of clients--wasn't legally required to pay their lost wages and benefits.</narrative>
  <narrative>Some recognize that Andrew Kalnow may have saved National Machinery, but they question why the rescue couldn't have been performed more humanely, taking into account the loyalty of many of the company's longtime employees.</narrative>
  <narrative>They believe Meshech Frost and Jane Frost Kalnow would be disappointed.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It's all about putting money in your pocket," Mr. Poignon said. "Maybe morality has changed. Maybe young people think this is OK. But in our day, this wasn't a moral thing to do. If you look at the business side of it, it looks pretty good.</narrative>
  <narrative>"But if you look at the human side of it, there's been a lot of damage."</narrative>
  <narrative>[From the Toledo Blade, Oct. 11, 2007]</narrative>
  <narrative>House Chairman Offers a Tougher WARN Act</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Steve Eder)</narrative>
  <narrative>The powerful chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee yesterday submitted his proposal to better assure workers are given notice before they lose their jobs in mass layoffs or business shutdowns.</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. Rep. George Miller (D., Calif.) became the second member of the U.S. House to introduce legislation to reform the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known as the WARN Act, a 19-year-old federal law that requires many employers to provide 60 days' notice before layoffs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Miller's bill was co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo).</narrative>
  <narrative>"These are really extraordinary improvements over existing legislation," Miss Kaptur said during an interview yesterday. "There are more teeth in this [bill] to treat the workers with more respect."</narrative>
  <narrative>After a Blade investigation in July highlighted the WARN Act and its shortcomings, a host of key politicians in Washington have addressed the need to reform the law. Among those who have responded are Democratic U.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Hillary Clinton of New York, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, John Kerry of Massachusetts, Barack Obama of Illinois, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, and U.S. Rep. John McHugh, a Republican from New York.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Blade's four-part investigation showed that the WARN Act is so full of loopholes and flaws that employers repeatedly skirt it with little or no penalty.</narrative>
  <narrative>The series showed that in crafting the WARN Act, Congress didn't charge the Department of Labor with enforcing the law. Instead, displaced workers must take their former employers to court to uphold their rights under the law.</narrative>
  <narrative>An analysis of 226 WARN Act lawsuits filed by employees showed that judges threw out more than half, citing loopholes in the law.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Everyone on the [House Education and Labor] committee is familiar with the Blade's excellent work on this." Miss Kaptur said yesterday. "The Blade has really done the country a favor in helping to highlight the importance of this legislation and to draw national attention to it."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Miller's bill--called The Early Warning and Health Care for Workers Affected by Globalization Act--would overhaul the existing WARN Act by increasing the notice period from 60 to 90 days, making the law apply to more employers, increasing financial penalties for violators, and empowering the Department of Labor to bring lawsuits on behalf of employees.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, it covers part-time employees and groups of 100 or more workers laid off by one employer at multiple job sites.</narrative>
  <narrative>The legislation also extends COBRA health coverage for recipients of trade adjustment assistance, allowing workers who are 55 or older or employees with more than 10 years of service to an employer to use COBRA coverage until they are eligible for Medicare.</narrative>
  <narrative>Miss Kaptur said Mr. Miller's new proposal has support from the "highest levels" of  Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).</narrative>
  <narrative>"There is a significant amount of momentum that has built for this measure," Miss Kaptur said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Ms. Pelosi, in a statement yesterday, said: "For too long, the Bush Administration has ignored the needs of workers who are left unemployed through no fault of their own. Chairman Miller and Congresswoman Kaptur have been relentless champions for the cause of working men and women, and the new legislation incorporates those concerns."</narrative>
  <narrative>Alex Conant, a White House spokesman, had no immediate comment last night on Mr. Miller's WARN Act proposal, but defended the President's record on helping workers.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The President has aggressively fought for and delivered tax relief for all taxpayers resulting in economic growth and job creation," he said. "The best thing Congress can do to help workers and those seeking work is to keep taxes low to grow our economy and create new jobs."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Miller's bill shares some characteristics with a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by Mr. Brown and a bill in the U.S. House by Mr. McHugh.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Brown's bill is co-sponsored by Ms. Clinton and Mr. Obama, who are vying for the Democratic nomination for president.</narrative>
  <narrative>The proposals introduced by Mr. Brown and Mr. Hugh, both called the FOREWARN Act, would lengthen the notification period required before a plant closing or mass layoff, increase penalties for violators, require more companies to provide notice before layoffs, and allow the Department of Labor and state attorneys general to represent workers in lawsuits.</narrative>
  <narrative>Julie Hurwitz, the former executive director of the Sugar Law Center, a Detroit-based nonprofit legal center which advocates for workers in WARN Act cases, said she is "heartened" by the congressional efforts to reform the law.</narrative>
  <narrative>"These are all sorely needed revisions that have to be made, particularly given the history of those loopholes that have existed in the original statute giving employers all kinds of wiggle room to essentially set their own agendas and still not be held accountable under the original version of the WARN Act," Ms. Hurwitz said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Still, Ms. Hurwitz wants lawmakers to go a step further and address increasingly common tactics used by employers to evade their WARN Act duties.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I would love to see somebody grapple with the use of releases or waivers that are now quite frequently used by employers to get out from any WARN Act liability or responsibility," Ms. Hurwitz said.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="LINGERING BITTERNESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we know that there have been job losses due to trade, there have been job losses due to technology improvements. There are other different reasons why jobs are lost, and we all feel the pain of those who have lost their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, the answer is not increased bureaucracy and increased problems that employers have to deal with in providing jobs and in coming up with new technology to create new jobs. The answer would be to streamline, to cut back the bureaucracy, yes, to give temporary help to workers that have been displaced, to give them the opportunity to get additional job training so that they can prepare for other occupations, and then to try to spread that pain across the country instead of just  having it targeted on those specific plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will offer later an amendment to this bill, a substitute, that will do just that. In the meantime, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote against additional bureaucracy and to vote against expanded government intrusion into the marketplace that causes these disruptions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman has 1 minute left.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="LINGERING BITTERNESS">
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could leave this to the marketplace, and you could throw your workers out on the street with no notice, no health care, no training, and that's it, and just tell them, welcome to the globalized world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We thought we would try a different tack. We thought we would give workers notice where it is practical for employers to do so so the worker would have time to deal with the implications of a lost job on their family, to try to save their home, to try to save their kids' education, try to save the automobile, figure out how to get another job or how to get to retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also know that many workers that are released don't have health care coverage or can't get it in the marketplace. So we extended COBRA. We made that decision many years ago. Forty million people have used that to get them to another health care plan or to hold on to their coverage as long as they possibly could. We said for older workers, you can take it to Medicare. If you are over 55 years old and you have worked there 10 years, you can use COBRA. You pay all the premiums, you pay the administrative  cost, but at least you have coverage. For some people, that's absolutely vital, because once they lose coverage, they can't get it again because they can't afford it or because they have preexisting conditions and they won't write that policy for those individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just about whether or not we are going to treat Americans with some sense of decency who work all year long, provide for their families, work hard, play by the rules or whether they are just going to have to crash to the street and lose their income, their houses, their cars, their kids' education.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like today to talk about the facts, and next week we will talk about the facts on trade legislation. I think the approval of the U.S.-Peru FTA that came out unanimously from Ways and Means is the antithesis of CAFTA. Let me talk about the facts on TAA, which relates to those who are dislocated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We received a letter dated October 23, 2007, from the Secretary of Labor, and she said it is important, and I quote, "that the negative impacts that are borne by a few are offset in the form of assistance to persons and firms that may be adversely affected."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say the facts are very different. It isn't a few. Trade isn't the only source of dislocation, but it is one of those and a substantial source. It's not a few. It's hundreds of thousands of people. We have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs in this country in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President, or at least the administration, has sent a letter indicating their strong opposition, and I want to go over the facts quickly. It says, and I quote, that this legislation converts TAA from a trade-related program to a universal income support and training program. That is simply not true, and I will come back to that when I talk about services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number two, it says the increased duration of income support under this bill would result in some workers remaining out of the workforce and on assistance for 3 full years. That's really not accurate because the first 26 weeks are usually taken up by unemployment compensation when people are not using TAA directly. And then there are 2 years. In order to receive income support, they have to be in a training program. Now, there is a provision for an additional 6 months, but it applies to a relatively  few people. So these facts don't support the strong opposition of the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am still hoping for bipartisan support. We did accept, voted for three amendments from the minority side in the Ways and Means Committee. We had three votes from the minority side, and I hope for very, very many more here on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, the administration statement talks about industry-wide eligibility determinations and says that it would include workers not demonstrably affected by trade. It's the Department of Labor that has the ability to determine this, and so that sweeping statement is simply not true. As to the service sector, the administration letter says the bill does not clearly articulate any separation of such workers from their employment, must be attributable to trade. I just ask they read the language in  the bill because it talks about articles or services like or directly competitive with articles that are produced  or services that are provided by such firm that relate to overseas competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I want to say a word about health care. Look, we increased it from 65 to 85 percent because 65 percent doesn't work. Only 10 percent of those eligible for TAA now receive health care. We have an obligation in this institution for people who are laid off, who are dislocated, to receive health care for themselves and their family, and 65 to 70 percent isn't going to work. We know it. We know it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate what Mr. McCrery is doing. I wish also that these two bills could have been better combined to take care of the advantages of both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you know, I have introduced the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, <bill type="h" number="1729">H.R. 1729</bill>, which seeks to expand the current TAA program to give greater resources to displaced workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier in the year, I asked Chairman Rangel to include the provisions in my bill in the comprehensive TAA reauthorization bill. I was pleased to see that many of these provisions made it into the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill expands TAA eligibility to include dislocated workers affected by a shift in production in which workers' jobs are moved to nations that have no preferential trade agreement with the U.S., including, particularly, China and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides a strong increase in the health coverage tax credit. <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> increases that credit from 65 to 85 percent. It increases TAA funding authorization from $220 million to $440 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was disappointed to see that <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> did not include a key provision to provide automatic eligibility for dislocated textile and apparel workers. However, I was pleased to see that it does include a provision that allows for industry-wide certifications. This bill requires the Secretary of Labor to conduct industry-wide certifications when three petitions from firms in the same industry, such as the textile industry, are certified within a 6-month period. This doesn't provide automatic eligibility  for dislocated textile workers, but it is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is a good program. I have worked hard to expand this program and make it better in the past, but we must make additional changes to help our manufacturing workers in this increasingly competitive global marketplace. While it is good that these workers are going to get extended unemployment benefits and insured health care, we all know that an unemployment check is no substitute for a paycheck. But when workers are displaced, we want to give them the skills  to successfully re-enter the workforce.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed working with my good friend and colleague Congressman Mike McIntyre on this bill and North Carolina's Rural Center. The Rural Center is a non-profit that seeks to promote economic development throughout North Carolina's rural areas, and the Center has been a tremendous advocate for helping dislocated workers throughout the state. This bill resembles many of the recommendations that were published in the Rural Center's report, "Gaining a Foothold--An Action  Agenda to Aid North Carolina's Dislocated Workers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since I have been in Congress, I have pledged that our office would do all it could to assist displaced workers from the 8th District and the State of North Carolina. I am extremely pleased that many of the provisions of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act were included in this bill to make it possible for these workers to receive expanded assistance and job training to help them to make a successful change in their career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues as we debate and develop legislation that seeks to help our Nation's workforce adapt for new careers and opportunities.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what makes America work is America's workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, America is going to work harder to protect its workers. We currently have a program that was put together in the middle of the night in 2002 in the midst of the fast track legislation, and it was never intended to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides protection for almost double the number of workers covered by that program. This measure before us also improves a more basic protection for all jobless workers, unemployment insurance. Only one-third of America's unemployed now receive unemployment benefits, and coverage rates for low-wage and part-time workers are considerably lower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides up to $7 billion to States implementing specific policies designed to eliminate unnecessary barriers. We ask States to count a worker's most recent wages when determining their eligibility. We ask States to end discrimination against part-time workers. And we ask them not to disqualify workers who must leave work for compelling family reasons like domestic violence or taking care of a sick child or following a spouse whose job has moved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are State options. We are not requiring them to do anything. If they don't want it, they don't have to have the money. But we are giving them the opportunity to take care of their unemployed workers. The improvements promise to provide unemployment benefits to over half a million jobless workers if adopted in every State. Women particularly stand to gain from this bill because they are more likely to work in part-time or low-wage jobs and are more likely to leave for family reasons. The  cost of supporting these reforms is fully offset by extending an unemployment tax that has been on the books for 30 years, and that President Bush is specifically asking us to continue. Any talk about increasing taxes is simply empty rhetoric from the other side. They know it, because the last time it was extended, they did it on their watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a vote in favor of this bill should be the easiest vote that  every Member of Congress takes this year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, losing a job is one of the most disruptive events that can occur to a worker and a family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be helping these individuals to get back to work as soon as possible. That's why I support the trade adjustment assistance and why I introduced a short-term extension of the program to assist workers displaced by trade through December.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I cannot support today's bill. In addition to expanding the TAA program, which already costs the American taxpayers nearly $1 billion each year, the majority shuts out numerous Republican suggestions that would have instilled accountability and increased flexibility for workers. One provision of their bill eliminates a State's ability to choose the best employees to administer TAA by requiring so-called State merit-based employees to run the program. This means that the 25 States  that currently use local employees or outside contractors like nonprofit or community-based groups to operate a more efficient and effective TAA program will no longer be able to do so and will be required to hire more government workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also amazed that the majority rejected our proposal to increase accountability by requiring States and organizations that receive TAA to meet performance measures. It should be the goal of all Members to see that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely, and the lack of such measures is a fundamental shortcoming of the bill. This provision is included in the Republican substitute that we will offer later today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Far from forcing workers into just any old job, Republicans have worked to find constructive ways to increase TAA program flexibility so workers could have more options to train for a new job and have greater access to employment services. But, again, these suggestions were rejected by the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all want to help unemployed workers to get back on their feet quickly. But TAA improvement, and especially an expansion of this magnitude, should have been considered in the context of expanding trade opportunities for all Americans through our pending free trade agreements, including Colombia, Panama and South Korea, and reauthorization of the trade promotion authority. Regrettably, we have no commitments from the majority on these important measures, despite months of work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, program continues to be an important program to American workers who are left out of a job because of increased imports or jobs moving overseas. When workers need assistance getting back on their feet, the TAA program is there to help them get a new job or new career. It is important for Congress to reauthorize this critical program that right now is helping 15,000 workers in Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act. This bill provides more funds for training programs, increases the size of the health care tax credit, and assists workers who are in training programs with additional income support. I wish, however, that Chairman RANGEL would have made the health care tax credit permanent instead of eliminating it after 2 years. That being said, I believe it is important that the bill raises the amount of health insurance assistance from 65 percent  to 85 percent. Now, out of work individuals will be better able to afford health insurance while they look for a new job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, where unemployment rates are higher than the national figures, the TAA program has been an invaluable tool in getting people into the classroom and into new, better paying jobs. The community colleges in my district have done a good job of expanding their curriculum to include new courses tailored to high-paying, expanding industries in Michigan. I remain committed to doing whatever it takes to maximize the Federal assistance available to help these workers and their families.  In so doing, I will vote for the bill before us this afternoon.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge Mr. Levin's role, in not only the construction of this legislation, but the role that he's played, I think, in trade issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the Trade and Global Assistance Act of 2007. Otherwise known as TAA, this program has been successful in transitioning workers who have been displaced by foreign trade into new jobs. Many workers and businesses in my home district in Massachusetts have already been beneficiaries of assistance provided by TAA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we're considering today will provide extended and expanded benefits and do so for more workers. It will also expand the critical health care coverage that these displaced workers and their families need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill doubles the current funding amount for retraining of workers for new jobs. But what might be the most exciting new feature in this proposal is the manufacturing and redevelopment zones which are very similar to the popular enterprise and empowerment zones that many American cities have had great success with. These new manufacturing zones will provide businesses with a host of incentives to redevelop in areas that have suffered substantial reductions in manufacturing employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TAA extension and expansion should go hand in hand with more free trade agreements. As one who is a supporter of the Peru Free Trade Agreement, which the committee of Ways and Means has just approved, TAA is the safety net we need to enact in a case- by-case opportunity to give benefits to workers and industries who have been displaced or disrupted because of these agreements. Of course, it is our hope and intent that all free trade agreements lift all  economies and industries of both participating countries. But if businesses are impacted and workers are impacted, we must have TAA to retrain that workforce for the jobs of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge full adoption of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there's no question, we need to do a better job of helping people who are laid off from their jobs. Even though only 3 percent of this country's jobs are affected by trade, if it's your job, it's an important one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when workers try to get help, what they find is this program is bureaucratic and inefficient and slow to respond. There's a big mismatch between the skills our workers have and the ready jobs that are available for them. But TAA does not do a good job of matching those skills and those workers. And I think there's been a good-faith effort to try to make this a better program, but, in my view, the underlying bill makes it a bigger program, not necessarily a better one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TAA is a leaky bucket, and I think we're making the bucket bigger and we're pouring more money into it. I don't think we're fixing the holes that really harm workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in the bill today we actually enhance duplication of efforts rather than streamline it. This bill prohibits a worker who's laid off for trade reasons to going to the local job training center to get help. In fact, what we require is a new State-run program that has no track record, has no proven success, and we relegate them to really a second tier training system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Houston we have WorkSource. It's at 35 different sites around our region. It helps about 340,000 workers laid off, has put 53,000 back to work at higher than average salaries. It's a great proven product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, a worker can't even go down the street to take advantage of those computers and that networking and that work with businesses, but we set up a less efficient one, unproven for them. It doesn't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I object to the pay-for as well. We are actually making U.S. companies less competitive as they sell overseas. As you know, today it's not enough to buy American; you have to sell American. We want to sell John Deere tractors and Apple computers around the world, and this bill, unfortunately, actually punishes those companies and hurts the workers for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican substitute is more flexible. It's less bureaucratic, and provides some commonsense training programs that will actually get workers back to work at a job they can raise their family on, which is what I think there is bipartisan support for.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, we would not send our troops into battle without the best training, armor or weapons.

    <paragraph>You name the time or the place, in a fair fight, give me an American worker at my side, and I know I'll come out okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the tragedy here is that, just as we have learned that too many of our troops deployed to Iraq without sufficient body armor or vehicle protection and too many Iraq soldiers have come home to face deplorable or indifferent health care treatment as veterans, for years, too many Americans, as workers, have faced bureaucratic indifference and roadblocks in securing training and adjustment assistance after losing a job due to expanded trade. Today, we plan to change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> doubles job training opportunities so no American worker will face getting in that line and finding out that when he or she gets up there the money's run out for training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes service employees and public employees in the protection, which we haven't had before. If you're a truck driver who loses a job because your company, that other company tells you, well, we no longer need your trucking services because that company's now moving to another country, you've lost your job because of trade, and you should be included as well. We make sure that that employer who has to begrudgingly tell that employee "I have to let you go," that that employer  can make sure that if it's a main customer that went abroad, you will be protected as an employee.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, clearly, anyone who loses their job in America due to factors beyond their control deserve help. That's why we have the unemployment insurance program in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TAA, obviously, goes beyond that and says, if you lose your job because of foreign trade, then you're going to get extra benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be even more enthusiastic about the program if I thought there was any agenda to promote trade by the Democrat majority. I see none. They have allowed the fast track to elapse. I have yet to see any trade agreement come to this floor. And I can say in Texas, the State that I hail from, one out of seven jobs is tied to trade. Trade is important. But I see no pro trade agenda here. What I do see is a massive expansion of another government program with a massive tax increase to go along  with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we know that roughly 3 percent of Americans will have their jobs displaced by trade. We know that trade will create far more jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But again, I might be more enthusiastic about this legislation if I saw the Democrat majority step up to do something about those who lose their jobs due to frivolous litigation. And yet they've excelled at preventing any kind of tort reform in this economy whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might be more enthusiastic about this package if I saw the Democrat majority do anything to address those who lose their jobs due to excess taxation, particularly on small businesses, the job engine of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And yet we know that the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee just announced "the mother of all tax hikes." Millions and millions of small businessmen all across America could see their taxes increase 25 percent. How many Americans are going to lose their job? Where's the sympathy for those people? Where is their particular special carve-out in the unemployment insurance program? I don't see it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet again another current theme we see in all the Democratic legislation is let's somehow loosen up the standards of who can qualify here. Whether it be for housing benefits and agriculture appropriations, whether it be in SCHIP, what we see is language to make it easier for illegal immigrants to access these benefits. We see it each and every time that the bill comes to the floor. We see it yet again in this legislation. Clearly, the American people reject this. That's why this particular  program needs to be rejected.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>There is a clash of philosophies that you are going to hear in the next hour.  We have included a greater scope, including services, as you have talked about. The notion is to expand and enhance, to deal with people who are disadvantaged, in some cases harmed, because of global impacts beyond their control. Our Republican friends would propose to redirect and reduce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We put more money for more employees with issues of health care. Their proposal, if you look at it carefully, is doing it on the cheap, perhaps with contract employees, capping training assistance at $8,000 over 2 years. Just because you call it a scholarship doesn't mean that it's not going to be a cut for over 25 percent of the workers on the current program in States like Pennsylvania. Even in Nebraska, 80 percent are going to see a 25 percent reduction because they already benefit from more  expensive programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that as a result of the debate today where people look behind the premises of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the program here, there will be an opportunity to make a judgment about what is the approach. Ultimately I hope we unite behind the approach in the bill before us, and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Texas, he obviously didn't read the bill. I recommend that you read the bills before you get up on the floor and make a fool of yourself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It says right here, section 114, "No benefit allowances, training, or other employment services may be provided under this chapter to a worker who is an alien unless the alien is an individual lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the United States, is lawfully present in the United States, or is permanently residing in the United States under color of the law."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You stoop to conquer. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Every time you get in the corner, you've got to bring up illegal aliens. It says it in the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, any law that I know of dealing with people who are out of work deals only with those people who are here legally. Get it? It's easy. It's simple. There are only three words here with more than three syllables. You've got to understand that, instead of coming to this floor and embarrassing yourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the dramatically accelerated pace of globalization is one of the more major phenomena of this era. We accept this. But we also believe that we must help shape globalization and mitigate its negative side effects so that American workers are no longer left behind. Dislocated workers put out of their jobs as a result of trade decisions must be protected. We need to first stop the hemorrhaging of the jobs. Just this morning, we had a 39-0 vote. How dare someone come to the floor and  twist the record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I understand how people can get emotional about some of the arguments with respect to these bills. My good friend from New Jersey is clearly agitated, and I understand that. But I would tell him that some very good lawyers have looked at the language in the bill, which is different from current law language with respect to providing benefits to illegal immigrants. And categories two and three, which the gentleman cited, "lawfully present in the United States" or "permanently residing  in the United States under color of law," do present problems. First, there are multiple definitions of what "lawfully present" means in current law and regulation. Even more fundamentally, literally millions of students and tourists and other "nonimmigrants" are "lawfully present" in the United States each year. The provision in the bill appears intended to make these groups eligible for TAA benefits despite their not being authorized to work in the United States in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the category of "permanently residing under color of law" is still more problematic. Even though the welfare reform law sought to do away with this ambiguous category, it continues to be used in some programs. SAA regulations, for example, define PRUCOL, permanently residing in the United States under color of law, to include, among other categories, "aliens living in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS/CIS and whose departure that agency does not contemplate  enforcing." That is, those who are illegally present and who could be deported but are not. This category could include individuals who were originally authorized to work in the United States for a temporary period of time, lost that job, and under current law</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I understand how we can all get emotional about this, but the fact is, at least according to the lawyers that have looked at this information and advised us, the bill does loosen current law with respect to verifying that people who are here illegally are not due the benefits. As the gentleman said, it appears that the intent of the bill is not to qualify those people, but the language of the bill, unfortunately, according to some very good lawyers, might, indeed, allow qualification  for those who are here illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I didn't intend to get into all of that. But the fact is that the bill that is before us, I believe, goes way too far in spending, way too far in increasing taxes, and, for those two things alone, should be rejected.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support expanding trade adjustment assistance for a very simple reason. Workers in our country need help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all acknowledge that the economy has changed. And one of the main features of that change is rapid displacement of workers. They have to update their skill. They have to change jobs. It used to be you could get a job for a company that you knew was going to be there and a job that you knew was going to be there, and everybody acknowledges that has changed, primarily because of global competition and because of technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this bill asks one very simple question: Do you think the workers of this country need help in this new environment with all of that rapid change, with all of the displacement that we have heard about from both sides of the aisle today? Do the workers in this country need more help to deal with that? Do they need a bridge between jobs, income support? And do they need training to help them be qualified for new jobs that will be available? And do they need health care support since so many  people in this country's health care is dependent upon their jobs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer to all of those questions is obviously yes. That is what this bill does. It expands the number of people who will have access to that desperately needed help. It gives our workers a chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that the new economy in globalization is here to stay. We acknowledge that. But what we on this side of the aisle want to do is help our workers deal with that instead of just saying, Good luck. It's changed. You're going to be displaced. We hope it works out for you. Overall, we'll be fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We focus on those workers who need help, and this bill gives them more help. It expands the service sector workers, and it expands the number of displaced workers in this country who will get that income support, that job training, and that health care that they so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge support for this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act so that all American workers will be able to realize the benefits of the global economy. <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> will update our system of trade adjustment assistance, TAA, to include service sector employees, strengthen benefit levels and duration, improve worker training, and stimulate economic recovery in affected communities. These are needed changes to ensure that workers affected by globalization are taken  care of if their job is lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International trade is an essential part of the American economy today and in the future. In fact, total U.S. trade of goods and services last year totaled $3.6 trillion. The reduction of trade barriers in recent years has led to a corresponding increase in trade volume, to the benefit of both American businesses and American consumers. Knowing that these benefits do not accrue evenly across all industries, however, Congress established the TAA program to help smooth the transition for workers  who have to make the shift to a more competitive field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The safety net for outsourced jobs, which consists of extended unemployment benefits, worker training, and a health care tax credit, was first enacted in 1962 and updated in 2002. This update, however, did not go far enough to bring the program up to date with current trade and labor realities. For one, the benefits currently extend only to workers in the manufacturing sector, despite the fact that a growing percentage of jobs shifted overseas have been from the services sector, such as telemarketing  and financial services. Since the nature of the American economy has moved away from a reliance on manufacturing, it only makes sense that workers in the services sector be eligible for the same support as industrial workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill makes a number of other changes to strengthen TAA benefits, including an increase in the health care tax credit, an extension of income support and training period, and a large increase in the overall funding level to ensure that no eligible worker is turned away due to lack of program funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> also takes the TAA program beyond the effects on individual workers by offering new tax incentives for investment in distressed communities that have lost manufacturing jobs. The whole notion of worker assistance is meaningless without creating new jobs for displaced employees. Targeting investment into communities with an available workforce would benefit employers and employees alike and maintain vibrant towns and cities across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill considers the needs of the larger Federal-State unemployment insurance (UI) system by dedicating $100 million annually for the States to improve UI administration. Additional funding for this purpose would also be available from Federal unemployment trust funds. This money would be an incentive for States to cover part-time, low-wage, and other workers in State UI laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to passing this bill today in anticipation of also passing pending trade deals in the coming weeks and months. By giving our businesses the freedom they need to sell American goods and services abroad, we are ensuring that the American economy will stay strong and competitive in the future. By assuring our employees that there will always be a place for good American workers, we will ensure a strong labor force capable of evolving along with the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support much-needed economic redevelopment through the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act. This forwarding-thinking legislation will ensure that America's workers receive the training and assistance they need to compete in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Globalization has had a significant impact on the American workforce, but our national policies have not kept pace with international economic changes. Gone are the days when men and women began and ended their careers at a steel or textile mill. Now, even customer service professionals and software engineers are losing jobs to overseas competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty years ago, in my district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, more than 46,000 people were employed in manufacturing jobs. Like many other working-class communities, my district suffered severe job loss when foreign competition forced major employers like US Steel, Jones Apparel and Rohm and Haas to shut-down most of their operations. By 2005, manufacturing employment in Bucks County had fallen 34 percent. The departure of manufacturing jobs resulted in vacant properties, abandoned buildings  and contaminated land--and in Bristol, Pennsylvania, crumbling roads and poor drainage put families at risk during a recent flood. But most of all, the decline in manufacturing jobs decline left thousands of middle class workers out of a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act makes substantial improvements to the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program and gives communities like mine a chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the Manufacturing Redevelopment Zone Program, this legislation will provide important tax incentives to cities and towns like those in my district that have suffered substantial reductions in manufacturing employment. Communities designated as manufacturing redevelopment zones will have a second-chance to revitalize their economy by attracting new investments that will create family-sustaining jobs. This program will help lift-up some of our Nation's poorest communities, but it is also  a chance to demonstrate our commitment to American innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While towns in my district still face many challenges, lower Bucks County has begun to turn the comer. Over the past 5 years, we have worked hard attract new investment, support workforce development and improve infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ongoing redevelopment at a former US Steel site is an outstanding example of my community's potential. Through incentives and a commitment to revitalization, that site is now home to a clean wind power manufacturer that employs over 800 people. More high-tech, green energy companies plan to open facilities in the near future. We have made great progress, but there is more work to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The additional incentives provided under a manufacturing zone designation would allow towns in lower Bucks County to make infrastructure improvements, cleanup brownfields, attract new investments and create jobs. Through ingenuity and good old fashioned American competitiveness we will move even closer to economic revitalization and energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lower Bucks County has enormous potential and I pledge to do everything I can to encourage economic growth and support middle class families in my district. Towns in my district are still struggling and I am proud to partner local leaders and the business community to support economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this bill, we give hard working Americans the support they need and strengthen a foundation for economic leadership. I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, The Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007, introduced by my distinguished colleague from New York, Chairman Rangel. This important legislation updates and overhauls the antiquated Trade Assistance Act for workers program of 1962.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's globalized economy, no worker is untouched by the phenomenon of the global trade market. In 1962, when the Trade Assistance Act was conceived and implemented, the status of American workers was much different than it is today. The existing and outdated legislation is marred with arbitrary eligibility criteria and inconsistencies as well as a lack of coverage for workers in industries that were not yet prominent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007, integrates all workers whose efforts in building our global economy make our economy flourish within the international system. Coverage will now be granted to workers in the service industry, which had yet to significantly develop in the 1960's, as well as secondary and offshore workers. The bill eliminates restrictions, ensuring that all workers impacted by trade are covered, regardless of where the factory relocated to or where  the import competition came from. This legislation will also ensure automatic certification for workers covered by ITC injury determinations, which is a major issue in the current economy in which products and technologies quickly are eclipsed and job security is never ensured. Furthermore,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation representing more than three million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and region, has urged Congress to pass this legislation. As representatives of America's workers, it is our duty to ensure that they receive all the possible security and benefits of their labor, especially in today's unpredictable global economy. This bill extends TAA job training and health benefits to service workers who lose their jobs  due to global trade and covers more manufacturing workers. It also dramatically improves TAA health care benefits and  strengthens job training benefits in order to ensure that our workers develop the skills they need to be successful in well paying jobs. This</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress has charted a New Direction Congress when it comes to protecting American workers and by passing an increase in the minimum wage. We must also ensure that America remains a competitive economic power. We must ensure that our workforce is adequately skilled and provided for, not just the privileged few who benefit from the prosperity of our nation but also the labor of everyday Americans who ensure the continued growth of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I feel that as this country moves forward, this bill is an important first step in ensuring that it does not do so at the expense of American workers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing global economic integration means the U.S. economy is more protected from domestic economic shocks because more people in more countries are buying American goods and services. But globalization can also produce harmful short term affects--such as when American jobs are lost as a result of trade. That is what <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> helps those American workers who lose their jobs by no fault of their own as a result of trade and who need assistance in meeting the new challenges of the changing global economy. The types of assistance provided include additional training, long term education, short term income support, and health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill expands trade adjustment assistance to service workers including government employees who are laid off because of trade. When trade adjustment assistance started in 1962, U.S. trade in services was not significant. Today, the service sector comprises more than 70 percent of the U.S. economy. <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> updates trade adjustment assistance to account for the size and growing significance of the American service sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also expands assistance to more manufacturing workers by eliminating restrictions on what country a U.S. factory's jobs are moved to or whether the loss of jobs are "downstream" so that all workers impacted by trade are covered regardless of where the factory relocates or where the import competition came from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> also helps American workers adapt to the needs of the changing global economy by enabling them to upgrade their skills. This bill doubles training assistance and provides up to 130 weeks of additional income support for workers who require a longer educational period, such as when finishing a college degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the Peru Free Trade Agreement was reported out of the Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 39-0. Many of us supported the Peru FTA because of the landmark workers rights and environmental provisions negotiated this past May that were inserted in the agreement. They were also influenced and encouraged by <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> because they, like myself, feel more confident that American workers harmed by trade will get the assistance they need to meet the new challenges created by a global  economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been over two decades since there has been any meaningful updating of this important legislation. Effective job training gives workers the tools they need to make the most of their employment and economic opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the first Trade Adjustment Assistance Act was passed in 1962 the job losses addressed by this law were mainly manufacturing jobs; today our economy faces the threat of job losses in the service industry as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> makes important updates to this initiative, including provisions that close outdated loopholes to make anyone who loses a job as a result of a factory moving overseas to be eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The bill doubles the training fund cap to re-train displaced workers from $220 to $440 million dollars, makes more service industry workers such as customer service workers eligible for assistance, and finally, increases the Health Care Tax Credit subsidy for displaced workers  who have lost their healthcare coverage to 85 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is timely and needed legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote yes on <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the amendment I offer, along with Mr. McKeon, is a substitute for the bill that is before the House this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment would reform and reauthorize for 5 years the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, and we believe our substitute would strengthen and improve not only TAA but the Workforce Investment Act program as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our bill would better equip workers affected by trade, globalization, and other causes of job loss with the skills needed to adjust to changes in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Republican alternative consists of four related pieces of legislation separately introduced this year. Some of these are under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee; others are under the jurisdiction of the Education and Workforce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other things, our bill would provide more flexible training options to get people into training sooner and back to good jobs more quickly. For example, we've heard some discussion about the plant closing notice. The bill before the House this afternoon would expand the amount of time from 60 days to 90 days that a plant company would have to give notice to employees of either plant closure or a substantial layoff at that plant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current constriction of TAA, a worker in that plant wishing to, perhaps, go to job training at night after he gets off work, waiting for the expiration of the 60-day notice or the 90-day notice could not qualify for TAA training benefits. Our substitute would correct that and allow that worker to take advantage of trade adjustment assistance while he is still working in that plant that he knows is going to be closed and where he would lose his job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number two, our bill would continue the health coverage tax credit over our bill's 5-year life and increase the premium subsidy from 65 percent to 70 percent. Mr. Levin earlier talked about how the current 65-percent credit has not been enough to entice a high number of laid-off workers under TAA to claim that credit and get their health care, their health insurance through that method, and he is right. The take-up rate on this benefit has been lower than we expected, and so some adjustment  is necessary. Whether that adjustment, the appropriate one to provide the right level of enticement, is 70 percent, or in their bill 85 percent, we don't know. We are willing to go up on that. We think it is appropriate to do that. We've included 70 percent in our bill. And the House should know that that means that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number three, our bill would convert the wage insurance pilot program for older workers into a transitional wage supplement for all TAA workers, regardless of their age. It would be allowed for any worker who became reemployed at low wages, low wages being defined as minimum wage plus $2.40 an hour, and allow them to obtain, at the same time they were getting this wage supplement, the health care tax credit and additional trade adjustment training, which right now, if a person goes back to work,  under TAA he is not eligible for those benefits. So our bill would expand the availability of the health care tax credit and job training under TAA for people who go back to work and who are receiving a wage supplement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number four, our bill would require indicators of performance to evaluate the Trade Adjustment Assistance programs and their results. Currently, TAA programs have no measure of performance, no way for us to tell if these programs are being effective or if taxpayer dollars are being wasted. Our bill would put in place those indicators of performance to give us the idea of the efficiency of these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number five, in provisions affecting the unemployment insurance program, our bill would allow States to apply for cost-neutral waivers of current rules to operate wage insurance and other demonstration programs to better assist unemployed workers in returning to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, I have heard some in opposition to the Republican substitute say that this would allow States to do away with their unemployment insurance benefits. We certainly didn't intend that in our substitute; we don't think that the language would allow that. But in any event, a State would have to get a waiver from the executive branch to take advantage of these provisions, and I doubt seriously if any executive branch under any President would allow a State to just do away with its  unemployment insurance benefits. So, I don't really think that's a valid argument in opposition to this increased flexibility that could assist unemployed workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And number six, our bill also creates a new trade-related category for qualification under the new markets tax credit. Businesses and communities experiencing adverse economic effects due to trade would qualify for an additional $500 million of new markets tax credits. These tax credits, we believe, would bring significant amounts of private capital into these economically disadvantaged areas to create jobs to replace those that had been lost due to trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we believe this substitute is a much more cost-effective approach than that contained in <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> and would help all Americans, not just those who lose jobs to trade, get the skills needed to find productive new jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for the substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my Republican colleagues for proposing a substitute today. It's healthy for America to see two different views on how we should help dislocated workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats want to help more workers who lose their jobs because of trade, especially workers providing services. The Republican substitute says no to helping those workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats want to assure more dislocated workers have an opportunity to receive training. The Republican substitute would, instead, cap the amount of training any worker can receive, not to go on and finish a program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats want to assure health care coverage is affordable for workers losing their jobs by paying 85 percent of their premium. The Republican substitute said, well, 65 wasn't enough, but we'll give you 70. So again, they cut the workers short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats want a better wage insurance program to help trade-affected workers who are reemployed in jobs that pay less than their prior employment. The Republican substitute guts the program as it presently exists and instead only provides a benefit to those at the very lowest wage jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans don't care if workers have a chance to get a living-wage job; they want to force people back to minimum-wage jobs. Democrats want to help States improve unemployment insurance for all workers who are denied unfairly their benefits, especially women. The Republican substitute goes in the opposite direction by allowing the administration to approve waivers from States that could deny more jobless workers unemployment insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, the Democrats want to help workers navigate the global economy. The Republican substitute, on the other hand, tells workers, well, you're still, more or less, on your own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After this substitute is defeated, I'm hopeful that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will ultimately join us in passing a bill to assist America's workers when they lose their jobs through no fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before yielding to Mr. McKeon, I want to  point out that the underlying bill, as described by my friend from Washington, does, indeed, double, and then even later triples, the TAA training budget when nearly $300 million of the current budget lies unused. That's just an example of how we think the underlying bill that we oppose goes way too far in expanding this program needlessly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee. I'm sorry, I've been calling it the Education and Workforce Committee. My apologies to the chairman and to the members of that committee. It is now the Education and Labor Committee, and Mr. McKeon is the ranking member.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, it has been 9 years since Congress last reauthorized the Workforce Investment Act, known as WIA. We made dramatic improvements through the last reauthorization, strengthening the nationwide system of one-stop training centers where workers can access a variety of training services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember not too long after we did that, two of the displaced workers in my district, we've lost many jobs for aerospace workers, two of them came up to me and thanked me for having done this because they had been able to go back and get vouchers, receive additional training. One of them was becoming a teacher and one was going to be a computer operator. And we've seen many people benefit from that program. But as yet, it has not been reauthorized this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The system has served job seekers well. WIA now integrates employment and training services at the local level in a more unified workforce development system, which it did not do prior to the 1998 reforms. Yet, without renewal today, it cannot possibly keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of workers in a dynamic economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, Republicans unveiled a comprehensive road map for reforming both job training and higher education. The Higher Education Act and WIA each play a critical role in keeping Americans competitive by developing the skills and knowledge necessary in a changing economy. Unfortunately, Democrats have not offered proposals to strengthen either of these critical programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to be joining Representative McCrery today in offering a proposal that links our job training reforms with the renewal of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. These proposals work hand in hand to provide dislocated workers the type of responsive, flexible training and assistance they need to get back to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our proposal will strengthen WIA's infrastructure, eliminate duplication and waste, increase accountability, enhance the role of employers, and increase the State and local flexibility. Together, these reforms will ensure the Nation's workforce development system can respond quickly and effectively to the changing needs of job seekers and those in need of training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time for job training is long overdue. The Department of Labor has made efforts to allow flexibility and creativity within the existing system, and numerous stakeholders have proposed innovative new strategies. However, this type of reform has been hampered because Congress has failed to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important steps we can take to strengthen our job training system is to increase program efficiency and focus on results. We must eliminate duplication and redundancy and create a more seamless system that can be flexible based on changing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment will eliminate current barriers to effective programs and services. We will enhance the services offered to job seekers, providing greater flexibility and eliminating arbitrary requirements that prevent some workers from getting the services they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also plan to restore long-standing hiring protections to faith-based organizations in order to ensure that they are able to participate fully in the job training system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To foster regional economic development, the Republican plan would allow regional areas to integrate workforce development programs, one-stop services, and community and economic development funds into a comprehensive workforce development system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, our plan would strengthen programs targeted towards specific populations, improving adult education, vocational rehabilitation, and youth programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support trade adjustment assistance, and I support its extension and renewal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize Representative McCrery for his leadership on this important issue. Our amendment will better integrate TAA with other Federal programs to more effectively equip workers affected by trade, globalization and other causes of job loss with skills they need to adapt to the changing global economy. It will join these TAA improvements to long-overdue job training reforms. We need to update these programs to be competitive worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in voting "yes" on the Republican substitute, which will provide a comprehensive approach to helping keep America competitive.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>But we should recognize that TAA is a Band-Aid on a self-inflicted wound. Our trade policies are gutting the American economy far beyond the ability of TAA to ameliorate the pain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is obvious is the loss of individual industrial plants. What is less visible is the increase in our interest rates and a decline in our national industrial base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, let us adopt the Band-Aid, but let us not use the presence of those Band-Aids as an excuse for further self-inflicted wounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Today, we should pass TAA. Tomorrow, let us stop the bleeding. Let us not adopt trade agreements that increase our trade deficit. And let us begin to renegotiate existing trade agreements so that they are based on results rather than based on form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us build an economy where demand for labor is so high that instead of hearing stories of pain from workers, we are hearing from employers fighting for every available employee. Let us hear of a dollar that is more valuable than the Euro and let us have a trade policy that for every dollar of imports, we match it with a dollar of exports. Until then, there are workers who are in pain, who are casualties of our ill-conceived trade policies. They need and deserve our help.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> and in opposition to the Republican substitute. Last Tuesday, 303 workers in Groveton, New Hampshire, a small paper mill town, heard over the radio and by newspaper the devastating news that Wausau Paper was closing the mill at the end of the year. On Friday, I sent a letter to Labor Secretary Chao asking for expedited help under the existing TAA, and on Monday I traveled to Groveton and met with a number of the affected workers. It is difficult to  describe how devastating this closure is to the town of Groveton, to the families of the workers and to the region. Many of the proud workers of that mill are third and fourth generation. They have got no other skills. This is the life they know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I explained on Monday to the workers what kind of help is available in the current TAA, the thought that was going through my mind was that this was not enough. We need to do more. These folks, their family, this community need more and deserve more help from the Federal Government. The ripple effects of this closure are huge. It goes out into the community, to other businesses and vendors. That is why the <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> provisions to redevelop communities hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs  through the designation of manufacturing redevelopment zones is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've got more workers who need help. They face harder times and higher costs, especially for health care. We need to expand the TAA. Now is not the time to go backwards. The Republican substitute is no substitute. It takes us backwards. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Republican proposal and support <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to Mr. Higgins of New York.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400641" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I represent an area of western New York which includes the Buffalo/Niagara region. Over the past 5 years, that region has lost 25 percent, or 22,000 manufacturing jobs. One of the gentlemen from the other side said that one of the reasons for not updating the program or adjusting it is because there is a $300 million surplus in the program. I would argue that that is the best reason for renewing the program, to include workers who are precluded from benefits today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose the Republican amendment. The Republican amendment would eviscerate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and its very purpose. Under the Republican amendment, it would preclude service workers from receiving benefits. Unlike <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, the Republican amendment does not cover service workers. Yet according to one study by a leading technology consulting firm, 3.3 million service workers will lose their jobs by 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican amendment would prohibit manufacturing workers whose jobs are offshored to China or India from receiving benefits. Current law precludes those workers from eligibility. 3920 fixes this inequity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Republican amendment would cut worker training benefits. All of the States who have enrolled displaced workers in these programs, the cost exceeds that which is provided in the Republican amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican substitute before the House at this time does not eviscerate anything, much less the TAA program which is reauthorized in the substitute for 5 years exactly as it is. The benefits are the same. The amounts are the same. I don't know where the last speaker got his information, but the substitute certainly does not eviscerate the TAA program. It reauthorizes the existing program for 5 years. Then, in addition, we make some changes in the law that allow those benefits under the TAA  to be used in instances where under current law they can't be used, and I have described one of those already in my earlier presentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope this House doesn't get the wrong impression about this substitute. It certainly endorses the TAA program. We are for the TAA program. We think it is important. But we think our bill gives a lot more flexibility that is needed in the program and some accountability in the program that is needed. In addition to that, we do provide additional funds in our bill, and it is paid for under the PAYGO rules of the House. I just wanted to make that clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and commend him for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the substitute being offered to us today and in strong support of the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act that we have been debating this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that in order to forge a renewed consensus in support of trade in this country, we really need to accomplish three things: One is we need a new template on trade agreements, one that I think will be reflected with the Peru trade agreement that will come to the floor next week that calls for core international labor standards and environmental standards in the bulk of the agreement so we begin to level the trading field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important ingredient is the strong enforcement of trade agreements by this administration and future administrations so that workers and businesses alike know that everyone is playing by the same rules and if they are not, there will be consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there has to be assurance to the workers of this country that when they do feel the adverse affects of globalization and job displacement or downsizing or outsourcing, there will be adequate programs there to assist them to get on their feet, from job training funding to adequate health care coverage during a very difficult and oftentimes traumatic moment in their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the substitute falls short in regards to the support mechanism. It precludes service workers from qualifying for these TAA benefits. It prohibits manufacturing workers whose jobs are offshored to China and India from qualifying for these benefits. It also cuts worker training benefits by capping it at $8,000, even though we know that the average State today is spending close to $15,000 for job training benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, they pull up short on the crucial aspect of adequate health care. They move from 60 to 70 percent support for the premiums of workers, whereas we go to 85 percent. And even at 85 percent, that remaining 15 percent can be very, very expensive for the average worker when they have lost their job and they don't have an income. They also don't minimize the gaps in coverage as we do. And they also don't allow the continuation of COBRA coverage for employees as we do in the substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would encourage my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> and oppose the Republican substitute.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have heard today, the TAA program helps hardworking Americans transition to the global economy and adjust to economic changes resulting from the trade policy of the United States. Training and education play a major role in whether workers will have future success on the job. We have seen the dissatisfaction of the American people with the global economy. You have heard from many of my colleagues on how many people have lost jobs. Most of them are manufacturing jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of these people that lose their jobs can be trained. I am happy to say that the Ways and Means Committee worked with me on making sure career and technical schools and colleges have the opportunity to be part of the TAA program. It is important for people to understand when someone is in their late fifties and they lose their job because of the global economy, that they have skills but they need to upgrade those skills for the world that we are seeing in the future.

    <paragraph>I am happy to say that the TAA bill that the Democrats have put forward are going to help our workers throughout this country, and with health care so that they can provide. Our workers are putting in more time than ever before. Our productivity is up. But, again, we have to keep pace with education. I am very happy to say that we are part of that educational system.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400266" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I oppose the Republican amendment which guts the trade adjustment assistance program's very purpose, which is to be able to help workers affected by trade and globalization get the help they need to get back on their feet and obtain new, good-paying jobs, and I support the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I joined other members of the North Carolina delegation and introduced a similar bill, <bill type="h" number="1729">H.R. 1729</bill>, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, whose essential language is mirrored in this bill. The provisions in our original bill were based on the recommendations made by the North  Carolina Dislocated Worker Advisory Committee, a group convened by the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center that included, among others, leaders  from the community college system, the Employment Security Commission and the Workforce Development Division of the North Carolina Department of Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, North Carolina's involvement in the TAA debate is important. Why? Because our State has had the most workers covered by TAA certifications, the most workers benefiting from the health coverage tax credit, and one of the highest number of workers enrolled in TAA-sponsored worker training. In fact, as of August 10 of this year, there were 12,693 TAA participants in North Carolina, including over 9,800 enrolled in training. That is why I am very pleased to support the underlying bill  and oppose this Republican amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also expands TAA eligibility to include dislocated workers affected by a shift in production in which the workers' jobs are moved to nations with no preferential trade agreements, such as China. It also gives our States the flexibility and increased funding to meet the increasing demand for services and increases the health coverage tax credit to 85 percent of the dislocated workers' health care premiums. It makes changes to simplify the application process for dislocated workers so  that they can get help in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last 5 years, Mr. Speaker, North Carolina has been hurt by manufacturing layoffs more than any other State. We have had the most demand for trade adjustment assistance. Therefore, I urge the Congress to oppose this substitute amendment. Let's get on to the business at hand, approve this underlying legislation and have the President sign it into law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of an amendment in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> offered by Mr. McCrery and Mr. McKeon. In particular, I would like to focus on the provisions in this amendment that would provide TAA participants with quicker access and more flexible training options to obtain the skills they need to return to work as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill> contains some TAA training reform, but it is largely geared towards keeping people in TAA longer, and is costly. In contrast, this amendment provides much greater individual choice and more flexible access to training through a new approach designed to get people into training sooner and better equip them to get back to work more quickly. For example, this amendment would improve TAA participants' access to training and education by: one, providing New Economy Scholarships of up to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also would provide TAA participants with more flexible training options that are not available under current law, including allowing participants to combine full-time work with either full-time or part-time training, or combine part-time work with either full-time or part-time training; and allowing training programs that lead to a license, certificate or community college degree and are linked to a high-demand occupation, as well as apprenticeship programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, this amendment would enable TAA participants to begin training sooner, even prior to layoff. This amendment also allows workers to focus on a job search sooner, while receiving income support, without also having to be in training or obtain a training waiver, which is required today. This amendment also would encourage better allocation of current training funds for the States, which have not been fully used, by requiring the Department of Labor to report to Congress every 6 months  on this funding allocation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe this amendment makes meaningful training reforms to TAA that would provide more flexible options to participants and better enable them to gain the skills they need to return to work sooner. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment in the nature of a substitute.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is an honor being here to address this piece of legislation, TAA legislation especially, better known as the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act. It is very, very important to the progress of trade. Also, it is important to many States out there in the Union. I think it is important. I stand to oppose the Republican amendment to this great piece of legislation, because if you adopt their amendment, you're doing less than what we would like to do in the  present legislation that is on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when it comes down to training funds, this bill doubles the current training funding cap from $220 million to $440 million and increases it to $660 million by 2010. This is music to the ears of so many States and especially individuals that have lost their jobs because of trade, because of globalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are here on the floor, especially with me being a member of the Subcommittee on Trade, we are here on the floor to promote not only training, but also assisting those States that are led by Democrat and Republican Governors. So I share with all of my colleagues here on the floor: Do what is right. To say that we can cut things in half or keep things at status quo and still do a good job by allowing individuals that have lost their jobs the assistance that they need as relates to training,  as it relates to health care, is just not living in the real world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage the Members to vote against the Republican amendment, oppose it, and support the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act that is brought by the majority. I know that it will be a bipartisan vote in the final analysis.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the McCrery amendment in the nature of a substitute. I support the underlying bill, <bill type="h" number="3920">H.R. 3920</bill>, which is important to our State of Texas and to our Nation. The Education and Labor Committee, on which I serve, is separately considering the reauthorization for the Workforce Investment Act. The Trade and Globalization Assistance Act is not the appropriate bill for addressing it. Rather than address the root causes of why little actual job training  services are provided under WIA, the McCrery substitute gives Governors and not consumers, the American workers, greater control over critical resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, most alarming is the fact that the minority believes it can simply change the bureaucratic elements of the WIA system and ensure those who need training receive it. Actual job training has fallen 50 percent under WIA, compared to JTPA. Only 200,000 adults and dislocated workers have received training, out of 8 million unemployed individuals. The Department of Labor estimates that less than 50 percent under WIA funds are being used for core, intensive and training services. In real  terms, appropriations for WIA have dropped by over $1 billion during this administration's clock in the last 6 years. Just this past year this administration has proposed a cut of $1 billion, including a rescission. Fortunately, our Appropriations Committee has restored this funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should also be noted that WIA expired in 2003, and the minority had ample opportunity to reauthorize WIA but failed to do so. Representative McKeon only introduced the WIA reauthorization bill earlier this month, essentially with the same proposals that failed to pass the previous two Congresses. Moreover, given the length of time that has transpired from the 108th Congress when the Workforce Investment Act was due to be reauthorized,  until  today, it is essential that we give this critical piece of legislation a fresh look.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a changing economy and labor force, which means that there are new challenges and new opportunities that we should consider. The Education and Labor Committee has actively begun the WIA reauthorization process. The Subcommittee on Higher Education, of which I am the chairman, held two hearings in June and July, and received recommendations from stakeholders on WIA reauthorization. The subcommittee also asked all interested parties to submit proposals to the committee, and  the committee staff is reviewing those recommendations that have been submitted by over two dozen organizations and continues to meet with interested groups on WIA. Committee staff has offered to work with the minority staff as WIA proceeds through the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, WIA programs have suffered funding cuts over the past 7 years, largely because the administration requested the cuts and opposed congressional efforts to approve WIA funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the substitute amendment and to vote for passage of the underlying bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the McCrery substitute and in support of the Rangel-Levin-McDermott underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to expand and open our markets to new competition, we have an economic and a moral responsibility to ensure that our domestic workers are equipped with the necessary skills and tools to compete in a global market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support free trade, which is all the more reason to support the reforms and expansion of a program that will help our workers adversely affected by trade and the globalization of our economy. It is estimated that more than 3 million service workers' jobs will go overseas by 2015, so the expansion of coverage to the service workers section is especially important and appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the McCrery substitute will limit trade assistance adjustment by not offering any support to service or public sector workers. The substitute will also set a cap on available training funds, denying many workers the tools and resources to be more competitive in the global economy. And as I read the language of the substitute, for the first time of the 70-year history of the unemployment insurance system, the substitute would allow States to deny unemployment insurance benefits to dislocated  workers. The underlying bill provides American workers with the support and tools needed to expand job training opportunities and transition workers into 21st century jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, <bill type="h" number="2930">H.R. 2930</bill>, triples the current job training cap to $660 million by 2010 and increases the health care premium subsidy to 85 percent. This is an important investment in the American workforce to enable Americans to remain competitive in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask my colleagues to vote against the Republican substitute and vote for <bill type="h" number="2930">H.R. 2930</bill>, the McDermott-Rangel-Levin bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would point out that service workers today are entitled to unemployment insurance benefits, and that is the primary form of income support under TAA. But to expand to service workers all of the other array of benefits under the TAA may be premature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a bill that passed this Congress and was signed by the President earlier this year, there was a mandate for a study to look at service workers and the impact of trade on service workers. We don't yet have, obviously, the results of that study, so it may be premature to just willy-nilly offer all these benefits to service workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while Mr. Moran spoke about some projection of losses of service worker jobs over the next 10 or so years, in an April 2007 paper, the Peterson Institute for International Economics evaluated data on the extent of the impact of off-shoring on service sector labor markets in the United States, and their review of the data concluded that just under 1 million American service workers lost their jobs from 2004 to 2005 due to mass layoffs of 50 or more employees, while 8 million service  sector jobs were created during that time. And of those 1 million jobs lost, only about 4 percent could be attributed to off-shoring or offshore outsourcing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think the question of the impact of trade on the service sector is certainly an open one, and the House may be well advised to wait for the results of the study that we mandated in previous legislation that passed this year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in opposition to this substitute and in strong support of the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really want to say that I think that this is the bare minimum that a society and a government can do for those members of our society that find themselves in a situation, really through no fault of their own, that they suffer job loss because of a decision that is made to close a facility or to transfer their job overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have now seen over the last decade is that there has been a huge impact in families all across this country, in all different parts of the region of this country, that have been economically severely displaced, that have had to scramble to try and get job training, to get health care, to get a new job, to get a new profession, to get a new occupation. At first, people thought it was only limited to those who did hot, heavy, dirty, nasty jobs. But that is not the case. What we see is,  with the continued trend toward globalization and outsourcing, that it can impact all different classes of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at a minimum, what we ought to do is make sure that those people have some ability to make a transition to that new job, to that new profession, to retirement if they are older workers, and not risk losing everything that they built up during the time that they were holding their jobs. They should not be in a position where they are scrambling to try to find health care, job training, saving their home, maybe their kids' education, and maybe even the car they need to go to work. Too often,  that is what happens in this country because of the inadequacies of these underlying laws. Trade assistance over the last decade, WIA over the last decade, have not provided comprehensive services for these workers that they can fully engage in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We need these kinds of changes that are presented by the committee bill coming out of Ways and Means. I believe we need the notification provisions that came out of the Education and Labor Committee, and clearly we need an extension of the COBRA benefits for people who find themselves in great jeopardy of not only temporarily losing health care, but very likely permanently losing health care until they are eligible for Medicare because they may have health conditions that are preexisting and  it is either so expensive to get an individual policy or people won't write that policy for them, for whatever excuses they have to cover up the idea of a preexisting condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a basic fundamental compact between this government that has made a decision, I think properly so, to engage the rest of the world through trade agreements and globalization, but we have to look at what happens here at home. These trade agreements are now being strengthened through the good work of Mr. Rangel and the committee and Mr. Levin and others, to provide for ILO labor standards overseas so we can compete on a fairer basis with workers overseas, with environmental  standards so we don't let them subsidize products by just dumping toxins into the rivers and bays and oceans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my distinguished colleague from Louisiana keeps worrying about the fact that we are mischaracterizing his amendment. I want to take a specific because the whole question of putting a cap on training benefits is a cut in benefits from what we presently have. The unworkable thing that was in the law before, when you cap at $4,000 the amount per year that a worker can get, a total of $8,000 over a 2-year period, in Minnesota and Maine, 50 percent of the workers spend $10,000. Thirty  percent of the TAA workers in Pennsylvania spend more than $15,000 over 10 years. Twenty-five percent of the people in South Carolina spend over $15,000. Eighty percent of the workers in Nebraska spend more than $10,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when you put that cap on there, you are saying to a 45- or 50-year-old worker who used to make 35, 40, 45, 50, $55,000, we are not going to give you sufficient money to really retrain for a job that you had equivalent in pay before. You are saying whatever you can get for four grand, fine, that's it. But if it takes more than that, well, you're on your own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is designed to try and help workers who were the middle class in this country, people who were making livable wages. Now, you also say in your bill that your wage insurance, it used to be in the present bill if you were over 50 and your job was making less than $50,000 a year, you could receive up to an additional $5,000 if you took a job that paid less than you were making before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what you've done in this bill, in this amendment you offer, you say we will give you a minimum wage job, and if you don't make an additional $2.40 above that minimum wage in your State, then we will sort of give you a little cushion up to that $2.40. That is pushing people to low-wage jobs. You are taking those $50,000-a-year people who were working in auto factories and working in manufacturing jobs across this country and you are saying, go out and get yourself a minimum wage job and we'll  give you an extra $2.40 an hour. My, aren't we generous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you understand why we talk about you gutting what miserable program you put in place in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill that we have put together here today is one that will allow States, and the reason why we put additional money in for training is no one could use it before. They will under our bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in response to the remarks of my friend from Washington, I would point out that using Bureau of Labor statistics, the average cost of training under current law is only $3,000. So the $8,000 New Economy Scholarship in our substitute more than doubles the amount available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the case of remedial education, the scholarship amounts to an extra $1,000, nearly tripling the average cost of training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most common provider of occupational training is the local community or technical college. The limit of $8,000 over 2 years is significantly greater than the average cost of a 2-year program at a community college, and is similar to limits that apply to other Federal postsecondary assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law, Mr. Speaker, while there is no specific monetary limit, as there is in our substitute, the cost of training must be reasonable and that reasonableness is decided by the various States. So the amount that is available is subject to judgment and to uncertainty. Our substitute removes that uncertainty so that a person knows going in how much he is going to have to spend on training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our substitute significantly enhances access to training by removing additional eligibility criteria and allowing people who do get new jobs to use the training benefit unlike current law. So we expand current law in that regard with respect to training benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope the gentleman from Washington has listened to my rebuttal and is convinced now that we don't gut the training benefits in TAA. If he is not, though, if he will vote for the substitute, I look forward to working with him to smooth out the complaints that he has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to Mr. Sestak, the gentleman from Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I watched the world change during nearly four decades in the Navy, having joined up in 1970. I have been almost everywhere. Several decades ago I went to China and to the United Arab Emirates when they were not the powers they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The strength of our international trade is absolutely crucial to the economic prosperity and global competitiveness of our Nation. But there are consequences of globalization, and we must address them if we are to remain and have a fully skilled workforce that can continue to compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why trade adjustment assistance is so important. It ensures the transition of the workforce that is negatively impacted by trade to step back and to receive the tools that prepare them to reenter the workforce at a higher, more skilled, competitive level. Good for them. Good for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The substitute amendment removes this focus on ensuring a more wealthy economy because of a retrained workforce. It actually caps retraining funding at $8,000, less than all but one State. This, when economists state that if our competitive ability, based on an innovative, skilled workforce, does not change, China will be the number one economy by 2050 and India number two. We will be number three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As service workers have grown to be a more significant part of the economy than they were when the initial Trade Assistance Act was passed in 1962, it is vitally important that we invest in their retraining also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The substitute amendment would actually remove these workers, needed to be re-skilled for our economic future, from the bill. And at a time when health care premiums have risen as a not-so-hidden tax, 70 percent in the last 6 years, the substitute amendment does nothing to fix the flaws in the old Trade Assistance Act that precludes families from receiving the health care tax credit for which they are eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, having visited the UAE and China decades ago, and seeing them now, there is no question that a small investment in a healthy, educated and retrained workforce is needed to preclude our economy from being number three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want the same quality of life our forefathers had when they invested in the GI bill, and this is no different. This is a small investment so we give the quality of life we had to our children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>The choice is clear. We have heard your rebuttal. Your bill does really nothing about the problem for people in manufacturing. If there is an outsourcing to China, the workers are out in the cold. That is cold, not like you. But it is cold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Service employees, why distinguish? It is an increasing part of our economy. You do nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In health care you put a little patch on a big problem, and that is not good health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially what you are trying to do with your substitute is to minimize the problem rather than maximizing an effective response. The 3 percent figure as to the impact of trade is really out of thin air. It is surely not true of manufacturing. Not at all true. Some who served in Republican administrations say it has been much more than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the capping of training, we heard the response from the representative of the administration. That $3,000 figure at best is an average, and even that is indefensible. Mr. McDermott read to you the number of States where training is much higher, so you essentially cut the worker off halfway. That's what you are going to do in terms of training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven States ran out of resources in 2007, nine in 2006; you do nothing. We need a new trade policy. We need a new, vigorous TAA. We need more than a pat on the back.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, do you have the right to close? I think you have the right to close.</paragraph>

  <chair> Under the rules of the House, the gentleman opposing the amendment has the right to close, the gentleman from Washington.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>We have the right to close?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> You have the right to close, that's correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Oh, well, thank you for the kind offer. I'm happy to close at this time, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we've had a good debate today on the different approaches that the majority and minority have at this point on the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. We certainly understand the importance of providing an array of benefits to people in this country who lose their jobs because of trade, and certainly Chairman Rangel and I have talked and agreed that it's necessary for Congress to take action and to make sure that people in this country know that as we expand trade, that the benefits  of trade expansion will be uneven. And there will be some in this country who will lose their jobs because of that expansion of trade, and we need to be prepared to assure those people that we will help them give them that helping hand to lift them up after they've lost that job and find training, education, whatever is necessary to get them a new job if they desire, and in the meantime give them benefits that will allow them to take care of themselves and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we agree on the importance of this program. I had hoped we would have had more give-and-take over the last couple of months with respect to crafting a bipartisan approach to reauthorizing the program, not only because the program was originally a bipartisan program, but also because we are trying, some of us on both sides of the aisle are trying to rebuild that bipartisan coalition for the expansion of trade around the world, knocking down trade barriers to our goods and services, to make  the playing field more level for United States producers of products and services. And as we attempt to create or recreate that bipartisan coalition for the expansion of trade, we understand that one leg of that effort has got to be reauthorizing and strengthening not only TAA, but perhaps even</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm glad that we have this bill before the House today. I'm hopeful that we can reauthorize in some form this very important program before the end of this year. I regret that I cannot support the majority bill that's on the floor today. I think we have offered a reasonable substitute and I'm hopeful that the House will adopt our substitute, and then as the process moves through the Senate and to the President, we can perhaps refine that product some more and get a bipartisan agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the remaining time that we have to the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="TITLE IV--WORKFORCE INVESTMENT IMPROVEMENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his important work on keeping America number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, the increasing global market has brought many opportunities but has also created unprecedented challenges as to how we address the increased economic insecurity faced by many of America's working families. For a long time, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, trade policy has focused more on opening new markets and has dismissed the real consequences of those faced by those who lose their jobs as well as their communities across America that are hard hit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats recognize that our economic future rests with our ability to open new markets for U.S. goods, especially since our markets are already largely open to our trading partners. However, the status quo is not working, and we must do much more to help American workers compete and thrive in the increasingly competitive global market. That is the purpose of this important legislation before us, the trade adjustment assistance bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, being from Massachusetts, I'm sure you've read in the history books, for somebody of my age I recall, when President Kennedy called for the, called upon the American people with his challenge to put a man on the Moon and have him safely return within 10 years. It was very, very exciting. It was almost unbelievable, but it did happen. Why I mention it, though, is because in his remarks at that time, President Kennedy said, if we are to honor the vows of our Founders, we must be first,  and therefore we intend to be first. For our science and industry, for peace and security, we must be first. And that's what this is about today, how America can continue to be number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have worked together with that Innovation Agenda in that spirit; the Innovation Agenda, much of which has been passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way by the Congress and signed into law by President Bush. And it will help promote, will make serious and sustained investments in research and development, help promote the public-private partnerships that will develop  high-risk, high-reward ideas into marketable technologies and more jobs for American  workers. In other words, we're saying, if we are going to compete successfully, we must innovate, and that innovation begins in the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Democrats recognize in the global knowledge-based economy, America's greatest resource for innovation and economic growth resides within America's classrooms, and we have made a new commitment to encouraging students and encouraging highly qualified teachers in the field of math, science and engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've also made higher education more affordable and accessible. Again, in the strong bipartisan way voted by the House, we passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. That was signed into law by the President and has made the largest investment in college affordability since the GI Bill was passed in 1944, a bill that was referenced by our colleague, Mr. Sestak, earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've also forged a new approach for free trade agreements where, for the first time, Democrats in Congress and Republicans, working with Mr. McCrery and Mr. Rangel, the chairman, working with the administration, were able to forge a new approach. For the first time, enforceable basic labor rights and environmental standards will be included in free trade agreements negotiated by the Bush administration ensuring that our trading partners do not lure American jobs abroad through  the use of weak labor laws and lax environmental standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill is the next step in our agenda to expand economic security. It's a departure from the status quo. The current trade adjustment assistance initiative does not do enough to help those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, as has been mentioned before, the bill will dramatically expand the number of workers who will qualify for TAA benefits. This is very important. It will offer increased funding and options for workers' training so that individuals can pursue substantive training programs that lead to higher paying jobs. It will expand access to health care by strengthening and streamlining the health care tax credit and other health benefits so that workers are not forced to live without health  care as they search for a new job. And it will revitalize communities decimated by manufacturing job loss with tax incentives. Those are some of the provisions of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would represent a huge step forward. This would say to the American people and the American workers who have lost their jobs or are concerned about losing their jobs to trade that they are not alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill represents a renewed commitment to helping American workers who have lost their job through no fault of their own. Free and fair trade can only thrive if we help those who are facing the downside of a global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the coming months, Democrats will continue to lay out a positive agenda to ensure economic growth and economic security for America's families. We will continue to pursue a positive agenda to keep America number one. I urge our colleagues to oppose the substitute and to support the underlying legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE PETER HOAGLAND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have sad news for the House today. Our former colleague and dear friend, Peter Hoagland of Nebraska passed away yesterday in the hospital in Bethesda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter served three terms in the House. Being an at-large Member from North Dakota, as I arrived, I looked to this distinguished gentleman from Omaha to be not just a friend but also a mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my years in this body, I have never served with anyone who enjoyed service in this Chamber more than Peter Hoagland. And yet, he would lay his tenure right on the line to stand for what he believed in and cast his votes in a way that were an example in high principle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter will be deeply missed by his family; his wife, Barbara Hoagland; five children, Elizabeth, Katherine, Christopher, David and Nick; as well as the countless friends he leaves behind. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have, for any Member requesting, the information in terms of how to contact the family during this hour of bereavement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to yield a moment to Congressman Lee Terry, who now represents the seat previously held by Congressman Hoagland. And at the conclusion of Congressman Terry, if we might rise in a moment of silence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE PETER HOAGLAND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of my colleagues here and the constituents of the Second Congressional District, our prayers go out to Barbara, his wife, and their five children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter passed away yesterday. He was a mere 66 years old. Many of you know that served with him that he developed Parkinson's the last few years, and it slowly had worsened. But as is typical with Pete, instead of feeling sorry, he went out and became an advocate for those with Parkinson's disease, frequently coming to our office to talk about his advocacy and also about local politics back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete first ran for the State legislature in Nebraska in 1978, where he became known as this idealistic, principled, yet liberal Member from midtown Omaha, which was surprising because he grew up in a family of pretty hard-core, conservative Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I got to know Pete. In fact, Pete even offered me a clerkship in his law office in 1986, and we became fast and good friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then ran for Congress in 1988 where, with the utmost dedication, he represented the people of the Second District of Nebraska, carrying on that principled, idealistic nature that he brought to the Nebraska State legislature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on behalf of people of the State of Nebraska and the Second Congressional District, I'll say that we will miss our friend, Pete Hoagland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I'd like to yield to my friend from New York.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Nebraska, and I too want to rise to pay tribute to my classmate in 1988, Peter Hoagland. Peter and I were best friends, socialized with our wives and our kids many, many times. He was truly a gentleman. Both our colleagues from North Dakota and from Nebraska really epitomized what Peter meant to all of us. His wife, Barbara, and the five children, a wonderful family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me just say that Peter was in public life for all the right reasons. He cared so much about this country. He cared so much about public policy. He cared so much about people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all the time I was with Peter, I was with him a lot, I never once heard him utter a negative word about anybody. He really truly respected this institution. He loved our country, and he respected each and every Member in this House, on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It came as quite a shock to me when I found out about his passing, although I had known that he had been ill for a while. Sixty-six is awfully young, too young, when you have such a good person with such a great, keen intellect and a wonderful person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just want to say on behalf of myself, my wife Pat, my family, and our class of 1988, we were 18 Democrats and 15 Republicans that year, we're all going to miss Peter very, very much, and may he rest in peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Will my friend yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE PETER HOAGLAND">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE PETER HOAGLAND">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know that Mr. Terry has spoken for all of us, and Mr. Engel, Mr. Pomeroy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us who had the opportunity to serve for an extended period of time with Peter Hoagland, for those of us who knew Peter after he left the Congress of the United States, this is a sad day. It is an appropriate day, however, to remember, as Mr. Engel said, a gentleman who had nothing bad to say about any of our Members on either side of the aisle; a Member who was positive in his approach; a Member who was gracious to all; a Member who cared deeply about his country, about  his State, and about his service in this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter Hoagland was a good and decent man who served his country well, and will be sorely missed by us all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE PETER HOAGLAND">
    <paragraph>At this time, then, Mr. Speaker I'd ask that we might have a moment of silence.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> A moment of silence has been requested. Will all Members rise.</chair>
  <narrative>(By unanimous consent, Mr. Shays was allowed to speak out of order.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE THOMAS MESKILL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to eventually ask for a moment of silence for a Member of this Chamber who has passed away; that's Thomas Meskill. He was in the U.S. Air Force and in Korea for 3 years. He was the former mayor of New Britain, Connecticut. He was a Member of Congress for two terms in the Sixth District. He was Governor of the State of Connecticut, and he was judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit. He was, for a period of time, the chief judge. He was clearly a distinguished  member of Connecticut, a very respected elected official, but was most respected for his service as a judge in the Court of Appeals for 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before asking for a moment of silence, I would like to yield to Mr. Larson, who wanted to make sure that this House recognized this distinguished gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400233" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE THOMAS MESKILL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Shays for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very difficult time for the Meskill family, whose husband, father, grandfather served as Governor of the State of Connecticut, was a judge in the Second Circuit, chief judge from 1991 through 1992. He served in this body with distinction. He was the former mayor of New Britain, Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity to work with Governor Meskill, Congressman Meskill, and our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to Mary, his lovely wife; and his entire family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to yield to the current Congressman from that district, Chris Murphy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE THOMAS MESKILL">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank Mr. Shays for bringing this before the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Member of Congress who now has the honor of serving New Britain, Connecticut, I can tell you, as someone who didn't know Governor Meskill and Congressman Meskill personally, that he loved the City of New Britain and the City of New Britain loved him back. He earned the nickname of "Tough Tommy" during his time in the Governor's mansion when he turned a very large deficit into a very large surplus in a short amount of time. As you have heard, there was hardly an office in Connecticut  in any of the branches that Governor Meskill did not hold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Britain is better off for having him. It bears his stamp. We all stand today to mourn his loss and send our condolences to the family.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="IN MEMORY OF THE LATE THOMAS MESKILL">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we rise in silence, if we could remember his wife, Mary; his two daughters, Maureen and Eileen; his three sons, John, Peter, and Thomas; and his seven grandchildren.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members will rise and the House will observe a moment of silence.</chair>
  <chair>The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the passage of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>
