    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman may state a parliamentary inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am asking you a question about the House rules. If I am not correct, further parliamentary inquiry, you are the arbitrator of those rules; is that true?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is correct that the Chair may describe pending parliamentary situations.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry. According to clause 2(a) of rule XX, it says that a recorded vote by electronic device shall not be held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome of such vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my parliamentary inquiry to you is: When would this rule apply to a vote where, at the end of the time, the outcome was different than what the majority wanted it to be?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair would advise the gentleman that the rules address the duration of votes in terms of minimum times; 15 minutes is a minimum time, not the maximum. A vote ultimately is called at the Chair's discretion, trying to accommodate all Members who wish to vote.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about a single vote. We are talking about the previous question vote, rollcall No. 145, which was held open past the 15-minute mark to change the outcome. If clause 2(a) of rule XX does not apply to that, what would it apply to?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is prepared to elucidate as follows:</chair>

    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman may state his inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what you just read, is that in the rules?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is the Chair's elucidation of the rule.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>So it is the Chair's interpretation of the rule, of clause 2(a) of rule XX; it is the Chair's interpretation that the vote can be held open to reverse the outcome of the vote?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The statement of the Chair speaks for itself. It is the responsibility of the Chair to see to it that each and every Member of the House of Representatives who responds to the vote has a chance to record his or her vote.</chair>

  <chair> The gentleman may state his inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Could the Speaker answer me why we have a time limit on votes?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The 15-minute time period is not a limit. It is a minimum duration. After that, it is in the discretion of the Chair in order to allow all Members a reasonable opportunity to vote.</chair>
