  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor a community in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 14 to 17, the residents of Washburn, ND, will celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washburn is a small town in the central part of North Dakota with a population of 1,389. Despite its small size, Washburn holds an important place in North Dakota's history. The Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition spent the winter at Fort Mandan, near where the town would eventually be located. Washburn was founded in 1882 along the Missouri River and named for Cadwallader Colden Washburn, a Civil War general, Congressman, and Governor of Wisconsin. "King" John Satterlund was one of the town's first leaders.  Washburn was incorporated as a city in 1902 when the Soo Line Railroad came to town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 125 years, Washburn has remained a strong community. The energy industry provides the driving force in the local economy. Washburn's residents are very proud of their community and enjoy the beautiful Missouri River scenery and quiet rural lifestyle. They continue to support the school, churches, and many other small businesses in town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Washburn, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well into the future. It is clear that Washburn has a proud past and a bright future. By honoring Washburn and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Washburn that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why it is deserving of our  recognition.</paragraph>
