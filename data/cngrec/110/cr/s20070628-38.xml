  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Craig Thomas was a very good friend. He served in the Senate with great honor and respect for the institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I got to know Senator Thomas best through the work of the Finance Committee. Senator Thomas was an active and dedicated participant in the business of the committee from tax policy, to health care, Social Security and international trade. When I was chairman of the committee, I could always count on his diligent, steadfast and  valuable involvement in the issues before us. I appreciated greatly his commitment to conservative principles and the responsibilities  of governing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, as chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, Senator Thomas was a strong voice for opening new markets and opportunities for U.S. exports. He went above and beyond and engaged himself fully in efforts to achieve ambitious outcomes from trade negotiations. He demonstrated his commitment time and again with his own personal time and his personal resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was a true representative for his Wyoming constituents. He worked hard and sincerely for their good and for the good of our Nation every day. He will be missed so very much. Barbara and I extend our sincere and deep sympathies to his family and his staff.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek recognition to honor the life of my colleague, Senator Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig, a real outdoorsman, would say he enjoyed nothing more than a horseback ride through Wyoming's spectacular wilderness area. Despite that, he found himself here in Washington, DC, working for the betterment of his Home State and the Nation. He was outspoken on government's need to provide adequate funding for national parks, a subject he knew well as chairman and ranking member of the National Parks Subcommittee on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was also a strong defender of his State's cattle industry and was a firm believer in the virtues of rural America. This passion stems back to his time at the University of Wyoming, where he received a degree in animal husbandry. Senator Thomas also served as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959, achieving the rank of captain, an experience that taught discipline and reinforced his commitment to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before Craig came to Congress, he served as vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau, and once headed the rural electric trade association of Wyoming. After 5 years in the Wyoming House, Thomas won a special election to replace DICK CHENEY, who was appointed to be Secretary of Defense. As Wyoming's lone Member in the U.S. House of Representatives, he had the responsibility of representing over 450,000 constituents. Craig was reelected to that seat in 1990 and 1992, a testament to his  ability to serve the people of Wyoming effectively. In 1994, he ran for the U.S. Senate and won, defeating popular Democratic Governor Mike Sullivan by 20 percentage points. He was elected to a second term in 2000 with a 74 percent majority, one of the largest margins in Wyoming election history. He was reelected to a third term in 2006 with 70 percent of the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas had no doubts about who he was or what he represented. He was not one to pick a fight, but if asked how he felt about a given issue, he would be sure to give his typically candid and honest response. When it came to issues he was passionate about, such as public lands and private property, he left little doubt as to his priorities. As a member of the Senate Energy Committee, and particularly in his leadership of the National Parks Subcommittee, Craig asked tough questions and made  strong statements about the responsibility of the Federal Government to care for the land it already owned; the fundamental nature of private property rights; and Congress's need to consider the interplay between these principles when contemplating new national parks or historic sites. He was always a fair broker, and I found on many occasions that he would give my priorities fair consideration and due process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much regret that Senator Thomas lost his battle to cancer. In 1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer. Had that war been prosecuted with the same diligence as other wars, my former chief of staff, Carey Lackman, a beautiful young lady of 48, would not have died of breast cancer. One of my very best friends, a very distinguished Federal judge, Chief Judge Edward R. Becker, would not have died of prostate cancer. All of us know people who have been stricken by cancer, who have been  incapacitated with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, who have been victims of heart disease, or many other maladies. I sustained an episode with Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer 2 years ago. That trauma, that illness, I think, could have been prevented had that war on cancer declared by the President of the United States in 1970 been prosecuted with sufficient intensity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal level, Senator Thomas had an extraordinary relationship with his wife Susan. As many of my colleagues can attest, Craig and Susan were quite inseparable and quick with humor. Even as Craig battled with acute myeloid leukemia he continued to serve in the Senate with extreme vigor and a smile. He leaves behind many friends and admirers, who have tried to emulate his courage, his tenacity, and his integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my deepest condolences to Susan, their four children, the whole Thomas family, and his very able staff.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I join so many Americans in mourning the passing of my dear friend and esteemed colleague, Senator Craig Thomas. Craig served the people of Wyoming with great integrity, honesty, and common sense. He was a true American patriot and dedicated public servant who never failed to put the best interests of his beloved state and country above personal ambitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig came from humble beginnings, working summers on his family's dude ranch near Yellowstone National Park. He earned a degree from the University of Wyoming, where he was a respected student and accomplished athlete, and from there he went on to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. It was these life experiences that taught Craig the values of hard work, perseverance, and personal responsibility. These principles guided him throughout his remarkable career, during which he worked for the Wyoming  Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau, and the Wyoming Rural Electric Association before winning a special election to the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, Craig was elected to the U.S. Senate, and went on to make his mark in a number of areas. He served with distinction on the Energy, Finance, and Agriculture Committees--posts he used to promote issues important to his constituents in the rural west and their quality of life. As the chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, Craig worked tirelessly to protect America's natural treasures, and as the co-chairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, he made significant strides in improving  rural health care infrastructure. No question, Craig's numerous accomplishments truly speak volumes about his commitment to the people of Wyoming and our entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig's greatest commitment, however, was to his family. He was unwavering in his devotion to his dear wife Susan and his children Peter, Patrick, Greg, and Lexie. My husband Bob and I are blessed to have known and worked with Craig, and we keep Susan and the entire Thomas family in our thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig's memory and legacy indeed live on, across Wyoming, throughout the halls of Congress, in the countless lives he touched, and in the public servants who follow in his footsteps. Our Nation is grateful for his many years of service and positive contributions. May God bless the entire Thomas family in this time of sorrow, and may God continue to bless his beloved Wyoming and this great land of the free--America.</paragraph>
