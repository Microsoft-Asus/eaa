  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago we commemorated the fourth anniversary of the United States' invasion of Iraq. Today we pause, and we voted for the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act, and we took a pivotal step in responding to the mandate issued by the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have opposed this war from the very beginning; however, I voted for this legislation because I am realistic about our circumstances. As long as our brave men and women are serving in this country, we have a moral obligation to ensure that they are trained, equipped and rested when they go into battle. Supporting this measure was not easy, especially in light of the fact that a young man from Baltimore, Kendall Waters-Bey, who lived only a few blocks from me, was the first to die in the Iraq  war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, after many discussions with my constituents and much contemplation, I strongly believe that <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill> was in the best interest of our brave men and women, the people of Iraq, and the people of these great United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I am opposed to the war, I have a responsibility to vote my conscience and a responsibility to help protect the servicemembers while they are risking their lives in Iraq. However, it is more important that we take care of those wounded warriors when they return home. When they have risked so much, we much respect them enough to provide the quality of medical treatment that they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the $124 billion to be spent, $900 million will be dedicated to two areas that I feel are of utmost importance, injuries which some military doctors say have become the signature wounds of the Iraq war: traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. This is in addition to the $20 million dedicated to addressing the problems that we saw at Walter Reed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill> provides $2.8 billion for military health care, this is not nearly enough for the thousands who have already returned or for those who are expected to need that care in the future. However, it is my hope and my intention to revisit this issue at a later date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is monumental because it marks the first time during our efforts in Iraq that Congress will hold the President accountable. No more blank checks. We have established benchmarks for the war in Iraq that the President himself has repeatedly stated must be reached to resolve this crisis. If these benchmarks are not met, this legislation requires the troops to be fully redeployed by August 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that there are many reasons that others oppose the legislation; however, the reality of the situation is very simple. Our troops will be in Iraq. In fact, more troops are being mobilized as we speak. We can no longer remain silent. We do not have the right to remain silent. Failing to pass this legislation was no option, because if we had failed to pass the legislation, we would have been in a situation where we would have sent to the President the possibility of a stripped-down supplemental.  So we have a moral obligation to provide the equipment and the adequate health care that our troops need. We have done that with the passage of <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Democratic leadership, our Speaker Nancy Pelosi, certainly to Steny Hoyer, and to our whip Jim Clyburn and all of the leadership members.</paragraph>
