    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 720 provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Clerk read, the rule provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule makes in order the Financial Services reported substitute. The rule makes in order eight amendments, including a complete Republican substitute. The amendments are each debatable for 10 minutes, except for the Neugebauer substitute, which is debatable for 20 minutes. The amendments are not amendable or divisible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All points of order are waived against the amendments, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, so many American families today are facing a critical housing crunch. The cost of an apartment or a home is out of reach for so many, but there is good news. Many of us in this Congress understand and will keep fighting for a new direction for America and more affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we will create a landmark affordable housing trust fund under <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> in this rule, which will provide over 1.5 million new affordable homes for hard-working folks across America over the next decade. I would like to thank Chairman Barney Frank and Chairwoman Maxine Waters for their dedication to American families in their efforts to make housing affordable and available to those who could use a helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They pledged at the beginning of this new Congress that they would focus on affordable housing, and they have stayed true to their word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four other bills in addition to this one that will be considered today expand American homeownership and provide relief to our neighbors, many of whom have been subjected to foreclosure due to predatory lending in the subprime loan crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new affordable housing trust fund will focus on construction, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing in our hometowns and communities across America. The trust fund will pool monies, together with State, local and private housing initiatives to target housing to families with the greatest economic need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The innovative, dedicated funding mechanism for this new trust fund comes at no new cost to taxpayers. Our efforts come at a critical time. Federal money for affordable housing has largely disappeared under this current administration. Health care costs are out of sight, the cost of living is higher, and many of our neighbors have not received raises that keep up with these rising costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard from so many Americans across this country. For example, in south St. Petersburg, just recently, I was talking with a police officer that works for the City of St. Petersburg. He said it was his dream to have his young son move into his neighborhood nearby. Unfortunately, affordable housing in that neighborhood is all but gone, and he will just not be able to swing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, local housing agencies across America have thousands upon thousands of Americans on waiting lists for affordable housing. In my hometown of Tampa, Florida, during a 1-week open enrollment session, more than 10,000 seniors, families and veterans indicated a need for affordable housing. But there is just no inventory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of receiving housing, they are placed on a waiting list. That waiting list takes 4 years, and it makes affordable housing completely unreachable for the other people that simply never made that call for help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of American households paying more than half of their incomes on housing increased to 17 million in the year 2005, with one in seven U.S. households being severely housing-cost burdened. This imbalance is very troubling, and when combined with predatory subprime loans, it has caused many homeowners to lose their homes. In the Tampa Bay area alone, in the first 6 months of this year, over 10,000 of my neighbors have found that their homes have fallen into foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new affordable housing trust fund will provide for the new construction, preservation of existing housing and homeownership, assistance, emergency housing repairs and housing-related services. Help is on the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> is a positive step in a new direction to ensure that more families are able to find clean, safe, stable and affordable places to live. I am proud to support this bill and this rule, and I urge the Congress to pass this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Castor) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>This rule provides for the consideration of a bill to establish a national affordable housing trust fund. Members of this House share in the commitment to meet the housing needs of lower-income Americans. However, we differ on how to best achieve this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that will be before us today creates a new, a new national housing trust fund, and, with it, a whole new level of Federal bureaucracy. There are already over 30 separate Federal programs designed to promote affordable housing. The new trust fund, created by the underlying bill, is modeled in large part on one of those existing programs, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why create a new level of Federal bureaucracy to administer essentially the same program that is already being successfully administered by State and local governments closest to the problem? It seems to me that ought to be a big subject of the debate that we have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this rule makes in order a substitute amendment offered by Mr. Neugebauer of Texas that would establish a national affordable housing grant fund program within the current HOME program. This proposal would meet the need and meet the goal of expanding rental and home ownership opportunities for low-income families without adding new layers of red tape. While I support the Neugebauer amendment being made in order, I am troubled that this is the only Republican  amendment allowed to be considered under this restrictive rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A total of 15 amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee by the 10 a.m. deadline yesterday. One amendment offered by Representative Capuano of Massachusetts to change the short title of the bill to the "Barney Frank National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007" was withdrawn. Out of the remaining 14 amendments, seven were submitted by Democrats and seven were submitted by Republicans. This rule makes all seven amendments offered by Democrats made in order, but just one  Republican amendment. If this rule is adopted, many thoughtful ideas will be denied the opportunity to be considered on the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, shutting out amendments offered by Republicans has become the norm for the Democrat Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans want to see Members on both sides of the aisle work together to address the problems our Nation faces. Unfortunately, with this restrictive rule, the Democrat majority has chosen to deny millions of Americans a voice on several significant issues related to meeting the affordable housing challenges that lower-income Americans face. Therefore, I must urge my colleagues to vote against House Resolution 720.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will inquire of my colleague from Washington if he has any additional speakers. Otherwise, he can proceed to close.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had requests from two Members, but I see they are not here. If the gentlelady has no more speakers, I will be prepared to close on my side.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's correct, we have no speakers. We have requests as well, but they are not here in attendance, so I think it's safe to proceed to close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans believe that every earmark should be debatable on the House floor and that the House earmark rules are flawed when it comes to the enforceability of earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, Republican Leader Boehner introduced a measure to close loopholes in the rules and allow the House to debate openly and honestly earmarks contained in all bills. Currently, 196 Republicans have signed a petition to bring this proposal to the floor for immediate consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we need 22 more Members in order to get real earmark reform before this can be considered by the House. The House cannot delay action on this any longer. Each day we put off closing loopholes in the House earmark rules, American taxpayers are left to wonder what hidden earmarks are contained in bills before the House. It is time we act to prove to American taxpayers this House is serious about earmark transparency and enforceability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be asking my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question, so that I can amend the rule to allow the House to immediately consider House Resolution 479 introduced by Republican Leader Boehner. By defeating the previous question, the House will still be able to consider the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act today, but we will also be able to address the earmark enforceability in order to restore the credibility of this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose the previous question and the restrictive rule which denies debate on several significant issues related to increasing the availability of affordable housing with the most efficient and effective use of government resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, despite the threatened veto by the White House, we will continue to stand on the side of America's hardworking families today and pass this landmark affordable housing trust fund bill. This will help our States and our communities achieve over 1 million new affordable homes for our neighbors over the coming years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings of Washington is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="720">H. Res. 720</bill> Offered by Mr. Hastings of Washington</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SEC. 3. That immediately upon the adoption of this resolution the House shall, without intervention of any point of order, consider the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="479">H. Res. 479</bill>) to amend the Rules of the House of Representatives to provide for enforcement of clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. The resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to final adoption without intervening motion or demand for division  of the question except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules; and (2) one motion to recommit.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ..... [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to  the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative>Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
