    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the right of people to openly and freely question their leaders and discuss solutions to common problems is the reason our democracy works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hold town hall meetings every August all across my district. This August, I had nine town hall meetings. I had over 700 people come out to these meetings. It is a wonderful time. The overwhelming majority of my constituents had a clear message: It is high time to change the way Washington does business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of western North Carolina are sick of wasteful spending and the broken Tax Code that funds it. They have had it with incompetence and waste in Federal bureaucracies. They are sick and tired of Washington not securing the border and stopping illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank my constituents for coming out to these town hall meetings. It is a sincere pleasure to represent them and to try to fight for that change here in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank them for coming out and making their voices heard. I have listened, and I am working to make that change.</paragraph>
