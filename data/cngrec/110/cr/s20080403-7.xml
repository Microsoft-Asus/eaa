  <narrative>HOUSING DEBATE -- (Senate - April 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2367">S2367</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate is evenly divided: 51 Democrats, 49 Republicans. Is the bill that is going to be the subject matter of the housing debate perfect? It is not perfect. But with the Senate as evenly divided as it is, we have to work on a compromise basis. We are not going to get everything we want. The Republicans are not going to get everything they want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was interested to see people in the press today telling us how they could have done a much better job on this work Senators Dodd and Shelby have done. I am satisfied with what we have. Is it everything I want? Of course not. If I were a dictator, I would come up with a different bill. But I am not. The Senate is such that everyone's rights are protected. When you have a body that is so evenly divided, with the procedures we have in the Senate, there has to be compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admire and congratulate Senators Dodd and Shelby for working this out to the point where we are. I have complimented them on a number of occasions. The last time I did it was last night, indicating what good work they have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, also, to get this bill where it is now, we needed cooperation from other people: for example, those who run the Finance Committee--Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. There are some tax measures in this housing bill, and they had to sign off on that. They did that. Their staffs worked hand in hand with the Banking Committee staff, and we have their product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to a good debate on this legislation. There will be amendments offered to take provisions out of the bill. There will be amendments offered to put provisions in the bill. That is the way it should be. I would hope that people would be willing to have relatively limited time. We wish to move forward on this bill as quickly as we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this stage, I have had a number of conversations with the Republican leader as to what we hope can be accomplished in this bill. I think at this time it is far too early to talk about timelines and when, in fact, we are going to get it done. We do know there is an emergency out there and we need to do it as quickly as we can. I applaud the bipartisan work, as I have indicated. I think we need to continue this effort of bipartisanship. I think it is critical to do this, to complete this action  on this important legislation, and in an expedited manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have not had the chance privately to ask the Republican leader--and I normally do not do this--but I will violate my own rules today and ask the Republican leader if he could agree to a unanimous consent to provide for housing-related amendments only.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say my expectation is that the amendments that will be offered to the bill will be housing-related, but I am not in a position at the beginning of the bill to enter into such a consent agreement. I think there is a widespread feeling on both sides of the aisle that we need to get an accomplishment here, that we need to do it on a bipartisan basis. But I am not in a position other than to say to my good friend that is my expectation. I am not in a  position to agree to such a consent here at the outset of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have an extremely important hearing that is going to start at 10 o'clock or thereabouts, being conducted by the two managers of this bill. The assistant leader, Senator Durbin, has agreed to manage this bill until these two good men can complete enough of their work at the hearing to come back and manage the bill. Senator Durbin is experienced, and he will handle things extremely well, as well as anyone could do that. I appreciate his stepping in.  He had his own schedule, and he set that aside to work on this bill. I appreciate that very much.</paragraph>
