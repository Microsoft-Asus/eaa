    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3682">H.R. 3682</bill> will designate more than 180,000 acres of new and potential wilderness in Riverside County, California. <bill type="h" number="3682">H.R. 3682</bill> also will add 31 miles of new river segments to the National Wild and Scenic River System and add nearly 8,400 acres to the Santa Rosa-San Jacinto Mountains National Monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is carried by Representative Bono Mack, the author of the bill. We want to commend her on her diligence. She has spent years crafting this legislation. Her hard work has paid off with a conservation achievement that takes careful account of fire concerns, which are oftentimes a part of the natural conditions of that area, recreational interests and all of the magnificent resources that lie within her beautiful district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure, <bill type="h" number="3682">H.R. 3682</bill>, will protect dramatic mountain vistas and vast desert landscapes, coastal sage and scrub and chaparral, and ancient Joshua trees. The areas covered by the bill include the largest ironwood ecosystem in the California desert, and one of the most pristine watersheds in southwestern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has broad support from over 400 organizations and businesses including local, State and national wilderness groups, as well as the National Hispanic Environmental Council.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Congresswoman MARY BONO MACK for including the language in this wilderness legislation that will allow fuels reduction and prescribed burns in wilderness areas, just as the 1964 Wilderness Act allows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also commendable is codifying an energy corridor which will allow renewable energy to be created and transferred through this new wilderness area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and his staff for allowing this language to be included in the bill, and I look forward to seeing this commonsense language included in future wilderness legislation. It will help protect lives and help provide energy which I think is critical as we begin to look at new wilderness areas being created around the country.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was mentioned a while ago about all of the different land that was available for oil companies to drill in, that they weren't taking advantage of, and I would like to quote some figures, Mr. Speaker, for you and for the American  people to hear because one of the things, I guess, that is part of this secret plan for our energy is to tax oil companies. Somehow the majority has got in their mind by taxing companies, the price of their product is going  to come down. I don't understand that, and I know that most of the people in the Third Congressional District of Georgia do not understand that, and I am sure there are probably people all over the world that don't understand that. But that seems to be their answer to everything, is to raise taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you talk about, Mr. Speaker, domestic oil and gas production, in 2006 the top 27 U.S. energy producing companies paid $81.5 billion in corporate Federal income taxes. That is $81.5 billion in corporate taxes, an 81 percent increase over 2004. In addition, they paid $3.1 billion in State and local government taxes. Those 27 companies paid 21 percent of the total corporate income taxes collected by this Federal Government in 2006. These 27 companies paid 21 percent of all the corporate taxes  paid into the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet these 27 companies make up one one-thousandth of the domestic corporate filers. And yet they paid 21 percent of all the total corporate Federal taxes paid into our treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Total non-income taxes paid in 2006 by the big 27 was $8.2 billion, and that was a 46 percent increase over 2004. Excise taxes collected by these same 27 companies on behalf of the Federal, State and local governments total $48.1 billion in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, these 27 companies were responsible for 44 percent of the total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production, and 81 percent of the domestic refining capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For fiscal year 2006, $10.48 billion was collected in the form of bonus bids, rent and royalties from oil and gas companies operating on Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The OCS, the Outer Continental Shelf, covers 1.7 billion acres of which 85 percent is off-limits to drilling. However, the Minerals Management Service broke records for bonus bids in several recent OCS lease sales. Last summer in the western gulf off the shore of Texas they received more than $289.9 million for tracts totaling 18 million acres. In February 2008 they received $2.6 billion for leases covering approximately 2.7 million acres in the Chukchi Sea. And in March, they received $3.7 billion  in bonus bids in the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CRS estimates that ANWR production would deliver $191.1 billion in corporate income tax and royalty to the Federal treasury at today's prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while they may not be drilling, you can see that 85 percent of the Federal land is off-limits. Maybe the land that they have to drill on doesn't have any oil reserves under it, any natural gas under it, any coal under it. That would be something, Mr. Speaker, for the chairman of the subcommittee to tell us, if there are any oil reserves or natural gas reserves or coal reserves under this 85 percent of Federal lands that does not have the ability to be drilled under. And then if it does have  reserves for oil or natural gas or coal, maybe he could tell us, Mr. Speaker, why we can't drill there, why it is off-limits, what technology are we missing to be able to drill in an environmentally friendly way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So yes, some of these companies do have land that they may be able to drill on. But as we see that this is a profitable thing for the Federal Government, to allow those companies to drill domestically, we can see the amount of money that it brings in. And goodness knows, the way the majority party loves to spend money, they passed a thing called PAYGO, the American people pay and we will go spend it. Now this is a great opportunity to get more revenue coming into our treasury by allowing us to  take advantage of our own resources that we have in this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals on Public Lands, it is my opinion that the oil and gas companies would not be buying the leases to these lands if they did not believe that oil and gas could be produced there. Yet these same companies are producing in other areas. Two months ago I was in the Gulf of Mexico surveying a lot of good work that is being done there, American companies and others that are actively drilling for both oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me repeat again the current circumstance which we are dealing with. Trends include not only the fact that 13 million acres are actually being used out of the 47 million acres that are on shore, but when you look at offshore, 10 million acres of the gas and oil land that has been leased to these companies are being used out of the 44 million acres that are currently being leased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we extrapolate from that, the fact is that today's production rates on Federal land and waters, we can estimate that 68 million acres of leased but currently inactive Federal land and waters could produce 4.8 million barrels of oil and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day, if the vast amount of land that is leased on which permits to drill have been allowed but is not currently being utilized were taking place. Are there other opportunities or options out there along with all of  the other variables of trying to come together with a comprehensive energy plan, certainly. But I think my parents told me a long time ago that to be prudent, you first ought to use those available resources that have been approved by both the Federal Government in terms of Federal lands, both on shore as well as offshore, and the States that we are also dealing with in the circumstance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are inventorying them and keeping a close eye on it, and we want to encourage that those lands already leased are utilized to the degree they could be utilized. And clearly, obviously, we will continue to look at all of the renewable sources of energy that are in our energy toolbox because there is no one silver bullet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire how much time is remaining.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes) has 13 minutes. The gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) has 15 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <chair/>
  <speaking speaker="400297" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key here, Mr. Speaker, is that 86 percent of our Federal lands are off-use for drilling. What we have to really recognize in this country is that we have to quit blaming people and have to start, in my opinion, place the blame on ourselves. It's not a Democrat problem; it's not a Republican problem. It's the whole Congress itself that's the problem, because for decades now, we haven't been able to open up the Federal lands for drilling for oil. And there's a lot of us in this body who believe  that what we ought to do is open up these areas for drilling, but, instead of using that tax revenue to go to pay for a lot of the things that we waste money here in Washington on, but instead take that tax revenue and invest it into the next generation of energy. That's what we're attempting to do on the Republican side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We actually, I've worked with, including Mr. Costa and other Democrats, to develop bipartisan legislation that would, in fact, open these areas up for drilling, and then basically make the largest investment in American-made energy in our Nation's history. And that's how we move from fossil fuels to the next generation of clean and renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today a half a percent of our total energy is produced from solar and wind power; and so to think that we're going to go from a half a percent anywhere close to the energy needs that we need, it's not possible at this time, Mr. Speaker, and we need to be honest with the American people about what really is the problem, why don't we have an abundant energy availability in this country? Why are we exporting so many dollars overseas?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the longer that we sit around and blame oil companies or blame OPEC or blame speculators, quite frankly, the longer it is the American people are going to be paying $5 per gallon per gas, as they are in California, or possibly even higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I'd like to see us do, Mr. Speaker, I said this earlier, bringing bills to the floor that are not only wilderness bills but would actually open up large vast areas for drilling, and not only bringing these bills to the floor, but bringing them up in a way where they  don't come to the floor with a closed rule, where the Republicans can't offer any of their alternatives. Because, essentially, what's happening is that a majority of this Congress, I  believe, both Republicans and Democrats, would vote to open up for drilling in this country. They would vote for that. We'd probably get 230, 240 votes, I would think. Because a lot of the folks that were elected last year, that helped put the Democrats in the majority,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I believe that if we have open rules in this Congress, where we bring bills to the floor that we can actually vote on, the majority will rule, and it would be a majority of Republicans and Democrats working together to open up our energy resources in this country so that we can begin to rely on American-made energy, and not continuing to export so many dollars outside of this country, which is, in my opinion, one of the most irresponsible things that this Congress has done for decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Speaker, I'd urge the Members to support <bill type="h" number="3682">H.R. 3682</bill>, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3682">H.R. 3682</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
