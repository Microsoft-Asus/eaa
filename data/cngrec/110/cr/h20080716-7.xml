    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the good work of the United Way of Hudson County, New Jersey. They have a distinguished history of working with their partners to help the homeless in Hudson County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to highlight just a few of the good things that United Way of  Hudson County is doing in my district. They are, in part, responsible for a Bayonne facility for homeless men, a program for the elderly in Jersey City, a training program for 59 shelter residents, housing for Hudson County individuals with HIV/AIDS, meals, soup kitchens, and educational services for homeless persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005 the United Way of Hudson County created an emergency shelter system for the homeless that was widely honored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the State of New Jersey, and the State Association of Community Development Directors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 they were awarded the County's first "Housing First" grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. This grant provided housing for social services for 26 disabled individuals. Their Housing First focus, championed by the United Way and the County Executive, Tom DeGise, will provide housing and hope for a better future for the homeless of Hudson County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please join me on July 30 for the second congressional reception honoring the United Way.</paragraph>
