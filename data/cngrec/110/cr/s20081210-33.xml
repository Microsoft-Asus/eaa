  <narrative>GULF WAR ILLNESS RESEARCH FUNDING -- (Senate - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10862">S10862</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to review the findings of the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses. This report, which was released a few weeks ago, confirms what many veterans of the Gulf War, lawmakers, physicians, and researchers have long suspected that the mysterious illnesses suffered by one in four gulf war veterans are real, and are a result of their exposure to neurotoxic chemicals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was not long after the successful conclusion of the gulf war that many of our soldiers returned home with multiple persistent symptoms including headaches, memory loss, gastrointestinal problems, and widespread pain. The symptoms were real, yet the cause and effective treatment have remained frustratingly elusive. As a leading member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I pushed hard for oversight hearings and continued research efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, 17 years after the end of that conflict, this report confirms that veterans' neurotoxin and pesticide exposure during the gulf war has been consistently found to be causally associated with gulf war illness. Unfortunately, this report also concludes that few veterans have recovered from their exposure, and treatments remain ineffective. While it is important that the cause of this illness has been established, it is unacceptable for our veterans to continue to suffer from these wounds  of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the findings of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, there must be a continued investment in gulf war illness research. It is estimated that 175,000 to 210,000 gulf war veterans are suffering from the effects of neurotoxin exposure directly related to their time spent in the Gulf. Once again, hundreds of thousands of soldiers find themselves back in the area as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Therefore, it is vital that we do all that we can to adequately  fund gulf war research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to learn the lesson of the value of candor and research. DOD and VA must be more open with Congress about the concerns facing our troops, from neurotoxin and pesticide exposures in the gulf war to the troubling issue of suicide, mental health issues, and traumatic brain injury, TBI, in the current conflict. We must address all the wounds of war, both visible and invisible, for our veterans who have served so bravely.</paragraph>
