  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Annie Work for her retirement from KWCH-TV in Wichita, Kansas. She has been a loyal employee since her first day in April 1986.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this fast-paced media world where people are rushed and feel rushed, one could always count on walking into Channel 12 and being greeted by Annie's warm and friendly face. I knew that every time I entered the station, I would be greeted with a hearty welcome and then fall easily into conversation with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of our favorite topics was golf. Her enjoyment of the sport and excitement she brings into the conversation about it is contagious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I know she enjoys her job as the welcoming face for Channel 12, I am sure that Annie would say her proudest accomplishment is being the mother of five daughters. Every parent enjoys watching their family expand, and Annie has had the pleasure of welcoming into the world several grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Annie will be leaving the television station, I hope she will continue to publish the Urban News. This monthly newsletter founded by, published, edited and circulated by Annie helps the community keep aware of events occurring around them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I congratulate Annie Work on her invaluable contribution to KWCH, our community, and the Fourth District of Kansas. I know she will be missed by the rest of the Channel 12 staff, and I will miss having the opportunity to speak with her during my visits to the station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish her all of the best in her retirement and all of her future endeavors.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
