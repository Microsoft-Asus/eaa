    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the purpose of <bill type="h" number="1337">H.R. 1337</bill>, introduced by our colleague, Congressman TOM COLE of Oklahoma, is to direct the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on alternatives to augment the water supplies of the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District and cities served by the district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Norman Project was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation for municipal and industrial water supply, flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife purposes in central Oklahoma. Population growth in the area is increasing pressure on already constrained water supplies, and the demand for water is expected to surpass the supply that the Norman Project in its present form can provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A preliminary report on alternative measures to augment water supplies at Lake Thunderbird has already been completed. The report concluded that a need exists to improve municipal and industrial water supplies from the Norman Project and that a number of alternatives are available to meet that need. A feasibility study is required to fully evaluate all the alternatives. <bill type="h" number="1337">H.R. 1337</bill> directs the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct such a study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1337">H.R. 1337</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, which I authored, provides for a water feasibility study to ascertain additional sources of water for the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District, which serves the cities of Norman, Midwest City, and Del City, Oklahoma. This bill provides limited Federal assistance, with the Conservancy District providing a local 50/50 match and demonstrating their dedication to this critical initiative. This legislation will help address and alleviate the water challenges facing these three cities.  I would like to commend and sincerely thank all the parties involved in working hard to help see this bill pass into public law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary source of water for the Conservancy District is Lake Thunderbird, completed in 1965 by the Bureau of Reclamation. Incidentally, since 1988 one of the cities serviced by the Conservancy District, Norman, Oklahoma, has on numerous occasions exceeded their annual share of Lake Thunderbird's supplies. As a result, Norman has been forced to pull additional water from its original water source used before Lake Thunderbird was built and create an emergency supply line from  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H7444]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, working with the Conservancy District and recognizing the water strain in central Oklahoma, Congress provided the Bureau of Reclamation with funding for an initial water study, which it completed in August of 2005. This appraisal explores and proposes much-needed viable opportunities to enhance the current and long-term water supply of the Conservancy District. I introduced <bill type="h" number="1337">H.R. 1337</bill> both at the behest of the Conservancy District and in the same spirit that Congress previously funded  the building of Lake Thunderbird and the appraisal investigation: to facilitate the long-term vitality and well-being of the citizens served by the Conservancy District and, as an extension, the vitality and well-being of Oklahoma as a whole. It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that the Conservancy District provides waters for more than 175,000 residents, meaning that no fewer than one out of every four of my constituents stands to benefit from this study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I sincerely appreciate the chairman and ranking member's diligent work on this bill, and I strongly urge support and passage of <bill type="h" number="1337">H.R. 1337</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
