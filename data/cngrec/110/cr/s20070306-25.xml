    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the joys of my job as a Senator is working closely with talented, dedicated Iowans from all walks of life. One of the exceptional people is Marvin Van Haaften, director of the Iowa Governor's Office of Drug Control Policy. With his retirement in January, he will conclude an extraordinary career in public service spanning over three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marvin Van Haaften has lived in Marion County most of his life, but his law enforcement experience and expertise has been felt throughout the State of Iowa. Before being named by Governor Tom Vilsack to be Iowa's drug policy coordinator in December 2002, he served as Marion County sheriff for 18 years. He is a graduate of the FBI National Academy, certified as a peace officer by the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy, served in the National Guard, and was a licensed medical examiner investigator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One key to his success is that he speaks with the authority of a seasoned veteran of decades on the front line fighting crime and improving public safety. Marvin was named Sheriff of the Year in 1991 by the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association and served as its president in 1996. With more than 32 years of law enforcement experience, he has taught extensively in the field of rural law enforcement, particularly death investigation and domestic violence crimes. He has provided local and  national leadership on the role of law enforcement in strategic victim safety and offender apprehension, and served on the board of directors of the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement. Marvin also served on many local and State committees such as the Iowa Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a law enforcement officer, Marvin has seen firsthand the ravages that domestic violence inflicts on innocent women and children. For that reason, he has been a committed advocate for combating domestic abuse. During the nineties he served on the President's National Advisory Council on Domestic Violence, chaired by the Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services, setting policy and developing domestic abuse and sexual assault training for the Nation. He was also a member of  Iowa's Domestic Violence Death Review Team, the Lieutenant Governor's STOP Violence Against Women Coordinating Council, and the National Sheriffs Association's Domestic Violence Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commitment that Marvin brought to domestic violence, he also brought to his role as Iowa's drug policy coordinator and director of the Office of Drug Control Policy. As a law enforcement officer, he saw the destruction that drug abuse wreaks on families--the broken homes and ruined lives. He worked very hard at both the State and national level to ensure that the voices and needs of local law enforcement were heard. He will leave very big shoes to fill. I personally am very grateful for the  excellence, professionalism, and long hours that he brought to this job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marvin also realizes the importance of a healthy, supportive family in a person's life: Marvin has been married to his wife Joyce for 42 years and has 5 grown children and 11 grandchildren. I am sure they will enjoy his retirement, but my staff and I will miss his counsel and his can-do attitude. I have turned to him again and again over the years, and he has never let me down. It has meant so much to be able to rely on someone of his caliber for authoritative answers and prompt answers.</paragraph>
