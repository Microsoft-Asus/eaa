  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN TUCKER WINDHAM -- (Senate - June 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4965">S4965</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the 90th birthday of one of America's and Alabama's most talented and acclaimed residents, Ms. Kathryn Tucker Windham. Ms. Windham is a beloved storyteller, author, playwright, photographer, television and radio personality and, most importantly, a woman of faith, integrity, grace and high ideals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This smalltown girl has written larger than life tales including "Thirteen Alabama Ghosts and Jeffery", along with many other historically based ghost-stories that involve smalltown urban legends in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi. She has also written works like "Twice Blessed", "GRITS" and "Alabama, One Big Front Porch", which reveal the rich joys of Alabama living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She grew up in Thomasville, AL, not too far from my rural home and not too far from another notable Alabama writer--Harper Lee. Her capacity for storytelling and writing started early, as a news reporter. But she did not stop there allowing her natural talent and inclinations to lead her to a higher plane of national renown. It is always inspirational to see a real person, an individual American, follow their own calling and achieve success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Windham represents the highest values of our State and region. This is so because she was raised right, studied hard, thought deeply, and was committed to a life that enriches others. A graduate of my alma mater, Huntingdon College, she followed its admonition, "Enter to grow in wisdom; go forth to apply wisdom in service."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known her and her son Ben for many years. I am so in awe of her. Not just for her noteworthy achievements, but because of the content of her character. She is an entertaining storyteller for sure, but she is a truth teller also. Her works reflect with truth the nature of the human condition. In them, she displays a love for all persons that reflects well on her rich heritage of religious faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She, from a lifetime of experience and insight, has been a leader in racial reconciliation in her home area. Persons of her integrity and stature can make a positive difference and she has. She supports good causes, knows in remarkable detail the history of the smallest communities in our State, and knows the importance of simply remembering. She loves children, capturing them with tall tales while stressing education and personal character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her wonderful southern accent is well remembered on NPR's "All Things Considered" and her commentaries are still heard on Alabama Public Radio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud her on her many achievements, and I am thankful to have such a beacon of literary excellence shining from Alabama. She is highly recognized for her achievements by the whole State and around the world and was one of the 13 artists chosen to represent the State by the Alabama State Council for the Arts at Alabama in France and Monaco in 2000. She was also honored in 2003 with the establishment of the Kathryn Tucker Windham Museum at Alabama Southern College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fellow Alabama author Harper Lee, author of "To Kill a Mockingbird", which is set in Monroeville not far from Thomasville, nominated Ms. Windham to the Alabama Academy of Honor in 2003. Some of her other accolades include: Alabama Humanities Award in 2000, the Governor's Award for the Arts, the National Storytelling Association's Circle of Excellence Award and Lifetime Achievement Award, the University of Alabama's Society of Fine Arts' Alabama Award, the Selma Rotary Club's Citizen of the  Year, and she was inducted into the University of Alabama College of Communications Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In true poetic form, I think, Ms. Windham sums up her insights in her book "Alabama, One Big Front Porch":</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alabama, they say, is like one big front porch where folks gather on summer nights to tell tales and to talk family. The stories they tell are all alike in their Southern blend of exaggeration, humor, pathos, folklore and romanticism. Family history is woven into the stories. And pride. And humor. Always humor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I speak for all Alabamians and all Americans when I express my gratitude for your eloquence, your literary achievements, and your humanity, and say, "Happy Birthday Kathryn Tucker Windham!"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to leave the Senate with a few of her words that truly embody the spirit of her work and life:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we need to be put back in touch with our childhood ..... to be reminded of what's important, like memories about people we loved, or things that happened to us that affected our lives, things we can laugh about and shed a few tears about ..... I think storytelling is a way of saying "I love you. I love you enough to tell you something that means a great deal to me."</paragraph>
