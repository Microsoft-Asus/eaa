    <paragraph>I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3911">H.R. 3911</bill>, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 95 Church Street in Jessup, Pennsylvania, as the "Lance Corporal Dennis James Veater Post Office."</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3911">H.R. 3911</bill> was introduced by Representative Carney of Pennsylvania on October 22, was reported from the Oversight Committee on December 12 by voice vote. This measure which has been cosponsored by 18 Members has the support of the entire Pennsylvania congressional delegation. Lance Corporal Veater was wounded in Anbar province, Iraq, and died of his wounds in Fallujah, Iraq. The mission was believed to be his last mission just 2 weeks before returning home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with my colleague from the District of Columbia in supporting the naming of this post office after Lance Corporal Dennis Veater. He was a dedicated marine who enlisted in 2004 upon his high school graduation and entered the Marine Corps Reserve at age 17, following in the footsteps of his marine sergeant major father. Lance Corporal Veater wanted to serve his country, and he wanted to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 9, 2007, just 2 weeks before his scheduled return to the United States, Lance Corporal Veater was mortally injured while conducting combat operations in Anbar province, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He leaves behind his fiancee, whom he planned to marry upon his return, and his 14-month-old son, Dominick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lance Corporal Veater did not die in vain. Today Anbar province is safer because of the work he and the other marines did there. I join with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in thinking it is very important to remember this man and the work he did for his family back home.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman and appreciate the comments of our friends on the other side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dennis Veater is somebody we are very proud of from the 10th District, and I rise in support of my bill, <bill type="h" number="3911">H.R. 3911</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to talk about and honor Dennis Veater  and those from Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District. He was born in Quantico. He moved to Pennsylvania where he graduated from Abington Heights High School in 2004. At the age of 17 he enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves. Dennis proudly followed in the footsteps of his father, a retired marine sergeant major.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as we have already found out, 2 weeks before his scheduled return, he was mortally injured while conducting combat operations in the Anbar province, Iraq. He died of his wounds in Fallujah. Lance Corporal Veater died fighting for our freedom. He is truly a hero, and he represents what is best about Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope by naming the post office at 95 Church Street in Jessup, Pennsylvania, as the Lance Corporal Dennis Veater Post Office, future generations will remember what this brave young man did for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members of Congress to honor this hero and vote in favor of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania for thinking to do something that we rarely see. We see post offices honoring Members of Congress, honoring judges, honoring very honorable people. But in my service on this committee, I have not seen a post office named for a young person who has died recently in battle. I do think it is an important way to indicate, particularly to the family, to what must surely be for many young men, many who knew him and looked forward to  his returning in just 2 weeks from the time he died, that his memory will live not only with this Congress and in this resolution but also permanently with a United States Post Office in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are pleased we were able to dedicate this resolution before the end of this Congress because this young man died just in March of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3911">H.R. 3911</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
