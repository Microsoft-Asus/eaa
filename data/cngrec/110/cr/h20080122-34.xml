    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of Ravdan Bold, Ambassador of Mongolia to the United States. Ambassador Bold is retiring as Mongolia's emissary to the United States, and I want to thank him for his service on behalf of the Mongolian people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and co-chair of the Mongolia Caucus, I've had the pleasure of getting to know Ambassador Bold over the past few years. During his tenure, America celebrated the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. He is an honest and capable public servant whose work here in Washington has been vital to the growth of democracy in Mongolia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mongolia remains a strong and strategic partner of the United States. Mongolian troops proudly serve in Liberia, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Iraq. I'm particularly grateful for Mongolia's continued support of our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan as the central front in the larger global war on terrorism, and I look forward to working with the future ambassador to strengthen this partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Ambassador Bold; his wife, Oyuum; his two daughters, Buyandelger and Buyanjargal, all the best in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
