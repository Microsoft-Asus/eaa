  <narrative>MAXIMUM COOPERATION -- (Senate - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8964">S8964</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say to my good friend the majority leader that he can expect a high level of cooperation from this side on moving forward on the extenders package, as we have essentially reached an agreement, which has basically been drafted. We will be working on a way to go forward, procedurally, on that measure at the earliest possible time. He will also get maximum cooperation from us on a variety of different matters he would like to consider prior to next week.  So we will stay in constant communication and try to see what we can accomplish on a bipartisan basis in the rather small amount of time we have remaining.</paragraph>
