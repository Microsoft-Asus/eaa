    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tonight in my community we will celebrate the lives of our fallen heroes who have fought so bravely to defend our freedom, including our own Matt Maupin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will speak to us and report on the surge and its success. As we debate this issue, I ask that we continue to support our men and women who have chosen to wear the uniform of our country and fight to keep us free. They know all too well freedom is not free.</paragraph>
