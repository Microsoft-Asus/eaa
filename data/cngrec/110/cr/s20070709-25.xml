  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor, with Senator Coleman, an amendment to prohibit the reimplementation of the Fairness Doctrine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we may remember, over the past few weeks, the Fairness Doctrine has received a lot of attention. Some Senators spoke about the need to reinstitute this doctrine. The Fairness Doctrine is a regulation the Federal Communications Commission developed to require FCC-licensed broadcasters to provide contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues. However, the FCC conducted a review of this regulation in 1985, concluding that "we no longer believe that the Fairness Doctrine serves the public interest."  In explaining why the FCC reached this conclusion, they wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interest of the public is fully served by the multiplicity of voices in the marketplace today and that the intrusion by Government into the content of programming unnecessarily restricts the journalistic freedoms of broadcasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FCC's refusal to enforce the Fairness Doctrine was later upheld in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would a regulation that was found to be unnecessary over 20 years ago be controversial today? Well, we found out why. On June 22, the Center for American Progress issued a report called "The Structural Imbalance of Political Talk Radio." Keep in mind that the Center for American Progress is a liberal think tank funded by George Soros and led by John Podesta and a lot of former Clinton White House people in it. The report issued was authored, in part, by a former Clinton White House adviser.  This report, not surprisingly, found that 91 percent--I believe this to be true--of political talk radio programming was conservative and 9 percent was progressive or liberal. However, what is surprising is the report suggested antifree market and antifree speech recommendations to supposedly provide balance in talk radio programming. There is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when the DOD was trying to feed the American Forces Radio and television services in the Armed Forces Network and have 50 percent of the programming be liberal. We fought that out on the floor of the Senate and we won because freedom of speech is more important. Consequently, we have gone back and let them decide--our troops--as to the programming they want. It is all done in a fair way so our troops at least can hear what they want to hear over talk radio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is for those people who think they have balanced political talk radio. This is a report on that subject. As I go through this, first of all, it identifies the problem they consider--conservative bias. That is what the American people want. It says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If commercial radio broadcasters are unwilling to abide by these regulatory standards or the FCC is unable to effectively regulate in the public interest, a spectrum use fee should be levied on owners to directly support local, regional, and national broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is this report. In other words, they are saying not only do these people who, because of their popularity, because of the content and the way they deliver it--not only would they lose their programs, but they would also have to give money to support public broadcasting. This is the most outrageous thing I have ever seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think this can happen in America. When you get John Podesta and the former Clinton White House team and their minds set to doing something, they are smart people, and I don't take this lightly. I ask as many people as possible to support our efforts to pass legislation to stop any effort to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine. I think we should call it something else, such as the Government-run broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The clerk will call the roll.</narrative>
  <narrative>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
