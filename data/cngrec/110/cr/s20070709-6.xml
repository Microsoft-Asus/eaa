    <paragraph>Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony and representation in criminal trespass actions in Iowa District Court for Polk County in Des Moines, IA. In this action, antiwar protestors have been charged with criminally trespassing in the Federal building housing Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY's Des Moines office on February 26, 2007, for refusing repeated requests to leave the premises. Trials  on charges of trespass are scheduled  to commence on July 9, 2007. Two members of the Senator's staff who had conversations with the defendant protestors during the charged events have been subpoenaed by the prosecution and the defense. Senator GRASSLEY would like to cooperate by providing testimony from these two members of his staff. This resolution would authorize those staff members to testify in connection with this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.</paragraph>
