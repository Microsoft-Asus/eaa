    <paragraph>Mr. President, I don't know if my friends on the other side of the aisle want any of the 3 minutes remaining. If not, I will proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to comment, briefly, on the life and passing of Gerald Ford during this period. I was listening to the remarks of my good friend from Virginia, and except for the part about eggs being thrown in Michigan, it struck an absolutely accurate chord, everything he said. It was kind of hard to imagine that anyone would throw eggs in Michigan, but I have to defend my home State. Other than that, I am sure his memory is very accurate and even the location no doubt is accurate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He talked about Gerry Ford and what he did heroically in World War II and how he survived the typhoon. Gerry Ford, when he became President, inherited a typhoon. Most Americans will remember President Ford for righting the ship of state during that stormy time when he became President. We all remember him for that because it was heroic what he did then for our Nation, a different kind of heroism from what he displayed in World War II but heroism nonetheless. He was deeply respected on both sides  of the aisle for his civility, his bipartisanship, his integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, in Michigan, in addition to remembering him as all others will for what he did to right that ship of state of ours, also remember him for a lifetime of service, including 13 terms in the House of Representatives from Michigan's Fifth Congressional District. And we, also, take particular pride in this son of Michigan and the manner in which he always treasured his west Michigan roots. There were many eulogies that were recently given about Gerald Ford, but in all of them it was noted that  he never forgot where he came from. That was a very important part of this absolutely wonderful man, a friend of mine, someone with whom I had a number of dealings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before time runs out for our morning business, I wanted to thank the Senator from Virginia. I don't know if this has been mentioned this morning or not. The Senator from Virginia authored an amendment during the last authorization bill which we adopted here which, by the way, is the John Warner Defense Authorization Act for the next fiscal year, named after John Warner in tribute to his chairmanship. But in that bill, Senator Warner offered an amendment that would name the first  of a future class of aircraft carriers the USS Gerald Ford. I understand that the Navy recently announced that it is going to follow the suggestion which was incorporated in the Warner amendment, which I was proud to cosponsor, but in presenting that amendment at that time, Senator Warner recounted some of the heroism of our dear friend, the recently departed President Ford, and his heroism both in war and peacetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Warner for the initiative he took to honor Gerry Ford's service to our country in a way which I think will have a very special meaning to President Ford because, as a Navy man, having the first of a future class of aircraft carriers named after him would bring a special pride to his heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford began his service to our country in the Navy during World War II, where he displayed great valor in combat, and this will be a fitting tribute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers are with Gerald Ford's beloved wife Betty and his family as we celebrate his life and legacy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I acknowledge the Senator's help on that. It was a joint project by the two of us.</paragraph>
