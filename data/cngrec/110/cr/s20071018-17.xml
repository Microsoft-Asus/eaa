  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today is Alaska Day, the day 140 years ago when our territory was officially transferred from Russia to the United States. That was the beginning of a long road towards the American dream for our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was once called "Seward's folly" has become one of our Nation's great assets. Alaska has more than made good on Seward's initial investment. The Federal Government has collected enough revenue from the development of our resources to repay this investment hundreds and hundreds of times over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Alaskans have worked hard to realize our land's vast potential. And, while much remains to be done, we have much to celebrate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are working towards creating a climate for investment, attracting capital to develop and market our valuable natural resources. As our state grows, we are working to ensure that all Alaskans enjoy the benefits of a strong and vibrant economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through programs such as the Denali Commission, we are building modern water and sewer facilities, health care centers and providing education and job opportunities to Alaskans in the far corners of our state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though many challenges lay ahead, today, we can look on our accomplishments and know that together we can continue making progress on the road to the American Dream.</paragraph>
