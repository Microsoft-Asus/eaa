  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11465]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maryland, the majority leader, to tell us what the plans are for next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished Republican whip for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business on Friday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday next, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour business and 10 a.m. for legislative business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We expect to consider the President's veto of the Children's Health Program; Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation; a resolution regarding the withholding of information related to corruption in Iraq; <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act; and <bill type="h" number="2102">H.R. 2102</bill>, the Free Flow of Information Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Friday, there will be no votes in the House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the President's veto on the SCHIP bill, we expect that vote to come, I believe the gentleman said, on Thursday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thursday, the 18th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>On Thursday, the 18th. I really have two questions about that. One is, what time during the day do we expect that to happen? After the 18th, we will have 5 more weeks before the extension expires, and I'm wondering if we can anticipate any effort to include the minority, if in fact the President's veto is sustained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. I don't know exactly what time. I would hope sometime around the middle of the day, noon or thereabouts we would consider the veto, maybe closer to 1 o'clock, but certainly in the middle of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course our expectation is that so many of your Members will determine that this policy is absolutely one that ought to be adopted that we will override the veto and that 4 million additional children will be covered. That's certainly our hope. I know that's not your expectation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in the event that that does not happen, I think the answer to your question is, I would certainly be prepared to discuss the matter with you. No one has any intention of, frankly, seeing children dropped from the Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the President's proposal, if we adopted the President's proposal, would result in a net reduction of 840,000 children from the current program. We think that's not appropriate and, therefore, we want to move legislation forward, appropriate funding levels, and we would certainly be available to discuss that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do anticipate, however, and are very hopeful that the Congress will work its will on this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information and for his attitude about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were concerned this week, many of our Members were concerned, including the Members who had voted with the majority, when the leader on the other side of the building suggested that if this bill wasn't approved there would be no bill. We're not for that. We're for including the children that are covered now. I think that does mean that you have to go beyond the President's proposal, though in fairness to the President's proposal, his proposal would not have taken people off this program without  intervening Congresses and intervening budgets, in my view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that's not the purpose of the debate here. The purpose of the debate is to try to have a program that works for children. I'm hopeful that we can arrive at a bill that I vote for, that the President signs, that keeps this program going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very pleased that the gentleman doesn't take the, if it doesn't work out to override the veto, as I believe it won't, that we still need to work together for a program that works well for children. And I appreciate the gentleman's comments on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if we do sustain the veto, I pledge that I'll work hard with you to try to make this program work in the way that the majority of House Members, the majority of House Republicans, feel that it should to continue the current program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will my friend yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would love to work with you on this issue just a little before we have the veto override, if perhaps we could convince you to be helpful at that point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if not, as we have in the past, I want to say something; my friends on my side of the aisle know this. I have always found the gentleman from Missouri, the Republican whip, to be open to discussion and reasonable discussion to see if we can move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know what exactly was said on the other side, but I would reiterate that nobody, I think, in this House, as I said in the debate, closing the debate on the CHIP bill when we passed it through this House very handily, that I believe every Member of this House wants to ensure that children have access to health care. And we need to work on how that can be accomplished. We think the bill we passed does that. But we certainly will be available to make sure that happens however we can get  it done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. I appreciate my friend's comments. And as many Members, most Members of the House know, we are good friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the bill that the House voted on, as you know, I don't think House Republicans had the opportunity to have input there. I believe Senate Republicans may have. House Republicans did not. And I would like to see us work together to be sure that the priorities and the program are all exactly what the American people think we're talking about and what we hope to be talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we near that November 16 day, my other concern would be the fact that we apparently are not meeting yet on any appropriations bills. I believe on the four bills that have been sent over from the Senate, that our side is ready to join the Senate, who has already named conferees, and name conferees at any moment, and hope to see that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wonder, do we have any sense of any effort to get some of these appropriations bills before the House and on the President's desk in the month of October? Or even before November 16? And if we have a plan there, can you give me an idea of what that might be?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've had four bills now. Some of them we've had for over a month. One, the Homeland Security bill, it is obviously important we continue those efforts; the Military Quality of Life bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We have had conferees named by the Senate for over a month now. We're ready to name our conferees, I believe, and I wonder if there is any way we can go ahead and at least start a conference to have a chance to get some of these bills signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are desirous, of course, of passing all 12 appropriation bills out of conference, through both floors, and to the President. We want to do that. We are working towards that end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell my friend I have talked to Chairman Obey. There are discussions going on between the House and Senate. He is correct, there hasn't been a conference yet. There are still some  issues that need to be resolved. But we are hopeful, in answer to your question, that appropriation bills will be on the floor and will be passed and will be sent to the President prior to the 16th of November. And as I have told my friend before, we have no  intention of getting to a place where the government is shut down. The best way to do that is passing our 12 appropriation bills and having the President sign them. We hope we can reach that objective, but obviously at this point in time, much work remains to be done. But we hope to be doing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate, as you know, was not in session this week and we are here in an abbreviated session because of the untimely and sad death of our colleague Jo Ann Davis. But we hope to move appropriation bills and we hope to have them on the floor, as the gentleman asked, prior to November 16.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would hope so.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't want that read as saying I believe that we can get all 12 appropriation bills before November 16 because the Senate has only passed, as you point out, four of the 12 at this point in time. We are hopeful that they will have bills on the floor next week and can get through those bills in a relatively short period of time so that we can move ahead. But I didn't want to leave the impression I thought that all 12 would possibly be moved through by the 16th of November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for those observations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, Mr. Speaker, I have been in the job he is doing now and in the whip's job on the majority side, and I do know that waiting for the Senate to pass their bills and taking blame, as we did and as others will in the future, for not getting our work done is a frustrating thing. But if we can move some of these along, I believe it's better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also, in response to the gentleman's comments about having the President sign the bills, hope that we are dealing with the reality that the President actually does have to sign those bills, and if he is not willing to sign the bill, we can go through the efforts of a veto and sustaining or overriding and all those sorts of things, but before we can get next year's business started, we actually have to have the President sign a bill. And I hope we are developing a strategy to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On FTA, the Peru FTA has been through the markup phase in the Ways and Means Committee, and I'm wondering when the gentleman expects that, the first of four pending trade agreements, to come to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I say to him that we had discussions on that today with Chairman Rangel and we are going to try to move Trade Assistance Adjustment to provide for any dislocations that might occur that Members are concerned about. And I'm hopeful that we can move as well the Peru FTA hopefully by the end of the month, but in no event later than November 16. So it is very much my hope between now and then. But we will certainly pass at least the Peru FTA along with the Trade Assistance Adjustment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say to my friend that Panama is another bill that I think might be possible; however, the gentleman knows there is a problem that has arisen unrelated to the provisions of the trade bill but which are of great concern to many Members on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I understand that. And, of course, I also understand that up until now, we have always done these trade bills in sequence based on the time they were negotiated, at least under the TPA regimen we have when the House has been involved in trade bills. And Colombia, Panama, South Korea are all out there. I hope we can figure out a way to have the kind of debate those bills deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to say to my friend I appreciate the accommodation of the House schedule this week based on the loss of our colleague from the First District of Virginia, Jo Ann Davis. She cared about the things this Congress does. She was a great Member of Congress. I think it's fair to say she was particularly focused on the armed services and on Federal employees, both of which she had a real opportunity to impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would say that I remember her seat over here where she almost always sat, that last week she was able to be here with us, just looking, and it was obvious the great health challenge she was facing and the incredible effort she was making to be here to cast the last week of votes she was able to cast. And for your quick accommodation of the schedule so that we could participate in her memorial service tomorrow and also, frankly, recognize her service by the House not being in session tomorrow,  I am grateful to you for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield for any comments you might want to make.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding, and I want to join him in commending Jo Ann Davis and sending our sympathies from this side of the aisle to her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity of working with her on a number of Federal employee issues. She and I both represented large numbers of Federal employees. She was very conscientious, hard working, focused, obviously very concerned about our national security, represented very substantial defense establishments, Navy establishments in her district. Her district was across the Potomac River from mine, as the gentleman probably knows, and we will miss her. I know that her constituents will miss her. And we  were certainly pleased to have the opportunity to make sure that any and all Members who could go and wanted to go would be able to attend the services that will be held for her tomorrow at 1 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his observations and join him in my commendations to her.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate your efforts to do that. She was an example of public service and personal courage.</paragraph>
