  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to talk about one of Alaska's greatest newspaper publishers and newsmen. Lew Williams, Jr. was a fixture in Ketchikan, AK, one of the State's largest cities as I was growing up in nearby Wrangell. Lew unfortunately passed away at age 83 this past Saturday, leaving a hole in the fabric of Alaska journalism that may never be fully patched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams was a successful publisher, no simple accomplishment when publishing newspapers in relatively small Alaska towns is expensive, newsprint had to come by barge from thousands of miles away, and advertisers and readers were sometimes far too scarce. But he never scrimped on his product and was fearless in writing strong, clear and always factually accurate and well reasoned editorials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lew was a champion in supporting statehood for Alaska back in the mid-1950s. Along with Robert Atwood, the former publisher of the Anchorage Times, and C.J. Snedden, the long-time publisher of the Fairbanks News Miner, Mr. Williams was one of the three pioneer publishers and editors in Alaska who did more to establish modern Alaska than most community leaders and politicians. Avoiding the trend to sell his publication to outside chains, his daughter Tena remains as publisher of the newspaper  today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also was a leading light in improving journalism in Alaska, being the founder in 1965, just 6 years after Statehood, of the Alaska Newspaper Publishers' Association, the forerunner to today's Alaska Newspaper Association. He served as president of each organization and later as director of the regional Allied Daily Newspaper Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams was born in Spokane, WA, in November 1924, the son of two reporters, Lew M. Williams, Sr., and Winfred--Dow--Williams, who worked for newspapers in Tacoma, WA. The Williams family moved to Juneau in 1935, where his father worked for the Juneau Empire. In 1939 Lew Williams, Sr., purchased the Wrangell Sentinel, starting a history of newspaper publishing in Alaska which continues to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving as a sergeant in the paratroopers in World War II, Lew Jr. ran the Wrangell Sentinel for the family. He married Dorothy M. Baum in July 1954. The couple bought the Petersburg Press and acquired the Wrangell Sentinel from Mr. Williams' parents when they retired. They later sold the two newspapers and bought the Daily Sitka Sentinel--Sitka being the site of Alaska's first pulp mill started after WW II--and also bought an interest in the Ketchikan Daily News.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ketchikan, a sawmill town in the heart of the Tongass National Forest, later saw its own pulp mill develop. The Williams sold the Sitka paper to  concentrate on the Ketchikan paper. But Lew was quick to help reestablish small papers in both Petersburg and Wrangell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many newspaper publishers, Lew Jr. was active in his community. He served on the Wrangell School Board, as mayor of Petersburg, and on numerous State boards including the Alaska Judicial Council, on the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska and as a member of the Board of Governors of the Alaska Bar Association. He served on the State boards under every State Governor, Democratic or Republican, through his retirement in 1999. He also served as the first secretary of the Petersburg  Fish and Game Advisory Board just after statehood, helping to foster the State's strong fisheries ethics that helped salmon to recover from the catch disasters of the 1950s to the all-time records for salmon harvest currently being produced in Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Besides government positions, Mr. Williams was a lifetime member of the Petersburg Elks Lodge 1615, the American Legion, the Pioneers of Alaska, a past president of Rotary, and for 29 years was an adult leader in the Boy Scout program. He also was active in the Democratic Party and was awarded an honorary doctorate of humanities by the University of Alaska Southeast. He also was the founder of the regional Southeast Conference and was named Citizen of the Year by both the Alaska State Chamber  of Commerce and the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce in the early 1980s. He won statewide recognition as the Alaskan of the Year in 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this speech is not meant as an obituary, but as a way for me to state my deepest appreciation for a man who epitomized Alaska during the past 70 years. He was a man who loved the beauty of Alaska, enjoying  hunting and fishing on the nearby Stikine River. He also pushed for the development of Alaska from its timber industry in the southeast to the fishing industry around the State. He was a strong voice in favor of the aquaculture movement in the 1970s that helped the State preserve and grow its wild salmon populations. He also was a tireless supporter of environmentally sensitive oil and gas development, first in Cook Inlet and later in northern Alaska. Lew, having lived in the grinding poverty  of Alaska long before statehood, always understood that Alaskans needed and still need good jobs and a strong economy so that the State can develop an economy strong enough to support good educational institutions, community infrastructure and allow the development of good health care and social service programs. He knew that Alaskans could grow the economy and protect our wildlife and environment. He never set up an artificial confrontation between the two goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his retirement, Lew wrote with the late Evangeline Atwood, the book "Bent Pins to Chains: Alaska and its Newspapers." The 2006 book is a lively history of Alaska as described through the development of its newspaper industry. The book, better than most, tells the tales of life in both the territory and State of Alaska as seen through reporters, editors and publishers. Lew, undoubtedly wrote the book as a way of honoring the many talented writers and editors that have practiced in Alaska  over the past 49 years since statehood, many of them reporters he helped recruit out of journalism schools, and helped mentor and train once they arrived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As his obituary earlier this week in the Ketchikan Daily News said, "He believed the editorial was the heart and strength of any newspaper. He editorialized for Alaska State, for the creation of the state ferry system, for the trans-Alaska pipeline, for power development, in support of the timber and fishing industries, and for airports, harbors and roads."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaskans have seen countless columns and editorials explaining to Americans--who never wanted to really understand the issue--why it was fully proper for some of Alaska's Federal highway funds to go for construction of a bridge from downtown Ketchikan to the city's airport, so that those who needed to fly out of the State's fifth largest city could actually get to their flights when high winds or low tides rendered the ferry system to the airport inoperative. For those who needed to catch emergency  medivac flights, a bridge was no expensive trinket, but a life-saving link to the outside world. Lew always championed Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can only say to his wife Dorothy, to his daughters Christena--Tena for short--and Kathryn, his son Lew III, and his daughter-in-law Vicki, and granddaughters Kristie, Jodi, and Melissa Williams, and great-grandson Milan Browne, all of Ketchikan; and his sisters: Susan Pagenkopf of Juneau and Jane Ferguson of California, how much he will be missed. Those in public life will miss his balanced and fair editorials, his prodding and his support. We will miss his ethics and deep-seated sense of fair-play  and ethics. And we will miss his wise counsel and thoughtfulness and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaska, and the Nation, has lost a great citizen. Goodbye Lew, we will never forget you.</paragraph>
