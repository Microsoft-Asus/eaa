    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the foundation of our Nation is education. Generally speaking, those with better educations earn more, are healthier and live longer. The road to a better society is paved with education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want more of our people to have the opportunity to travel the road to a better society. This is why I will support <bill type="h" number="5">H.R. 5</bill>. It cuts interest rates on subsidized student loans in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. It saves the typical borrower $4,400. It provides more opportunities for more Americans to have more opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will support <bill type="h" number="5">H.R. 5</bill>.</paragraph>
