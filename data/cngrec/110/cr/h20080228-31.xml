  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1168]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maryland, the majority leader, for information about the schedule for next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Republican Whip.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the House will meet in pro forma session at 2 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday the House will meet at 10 a.m. On Friday there will be no votes in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow. We will consider <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. In addition, we hope to consider legislation regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. There may well be other legislation as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the leader for that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I'm certainly hopeful we can do whatever is necessary to get that bill to the floor. I know that a majority of Members of the House, at least I believe a majority of the Members of the House, based on what I believe to be the case on this side and on the letter sent to the Speaker by Members from your side, a majority would be ready to pass a bill that met the standards of the Senate, in fact, the Senate bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm wondering if the gentleman has any idea if we would have that legislation or previous House-passed legislation, or what kind of product you think we may be moving toward as it relates to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman knows, this bill was passed in the Senate a little over 2 weeks ago. Since that time we have had an extensive number of meetings, discussions. I'm hopeful, as you know, to have discussions with the whip, with the distinguished Republican whip, my friend, on this issue as well. I think both of us are going to be here tomorrow. We'll take that time perhaps to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As I said, and I've said repeatedly, I think every Member of this House wants to pass legislation which will facilitate the interception of particularly foreign-to-foreign communications which may pose a danger to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us are aware of the fact that technological changes have resulted in some questions being raised because of the fact that we have many of the communications coming through the United States. I frankly think, as the gentleman knows, there is really not a great deal of controversy or difference between the two Houses or between our two sides of the aisle on this issue. There's some differences, but they're not major differences. I think they can be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are major differences with respect to the second title of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill which comes from the Senate which deals with retroactive immunity, which has nothing about prospective security but is obviously important for us to consider. We're also working on that as well, but I will tell the gentleman that we don't have agreement. But, as I said, I'm very hopeful that we will have legislation on the floor next week. I do not expect it to be, as the gentleman asked,  the same bill that passed the House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I would thank the gentleman for that. I hope we can work to resolve this. I do think the foreign individuals making calls in a foreign country, for that to work the way it needs to work, voluntary compliance is extremely important; and that's why working out this liability issue is, in my view, critical to that foreign-to-foreign, the only area where we say a foreign person in a foreign country, the only area where we don't believe a warrant would be required but that to not</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman knows, both the RESTORE Act, which passed this House, and the Senate bill both are similar in giving prospective immunity to telecoms that voluntarily or pursuant to order cooperate with us in accomplishing that objective. We believe, of course, that FISA was established so that a court review on process would be appropriate to ensure, in fact, that the collection of information is on foreign-to-foreign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We well understand that, as the DNI has indicated, prospectively you may not know so you need authorization. Our bill provides for that. The Senate bill provides for that. I really don't believe that is a major contention of the bill. That's prospectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A major contention is, which we believe has nothing to do with security, on what has been done, and, frankly, I'm not sure we know exactly what has been done. As you know, I've taken the opportunity to be up in the intelligence room, in the secure room, and go through the papers that have been provided. My own view is they're not dispositive of the issue; but irrespective of that, we're working on title II as well, and I look forward to having discussions on that with you as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I do, too. I do think this liability issue is important. We want to continue to have voluntary compliance. We also don't want to put these companies that have voluntarily complied in a situation where the only way to prove that what they did was appropriate is to produce documents that are at this point, we believe, in the national security of the country not producible; but maybe we can work through this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope to see this bill on the floor next week. I think we've had 2 weeks that I and others feel that each day the process gets more cumbersome than the day before because of the way this process builds up, and I look forward to working with you on that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I might comment on that, as you know, from our perspective, this is one of the problems. This is a very serious, important bill. It's critical to the defense of our country. I want to see that facilitated. I think every Member on both sides of the aisle wants to see that facilitated, but there are serious issues. There are serious constitutional issues involved here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why FISA was passed in 1978, very frankly, as a result of an administration that intercepted communications here domestically. You will recall that, I know, and a great concern about that. FISA was adopted by the Congress and signed by the President in an attempt to try to ensure that those kinds of things that happened in the early 1970s were not repeated by the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these are serious issues. Unfortunately, the Senate which had our bill for 2 1/2  months and had spent a lot of time considering a bill long before we passed our bill did not send us a bill until, as I said, about 14 days ago, and we have since that time, notwithstanding the fact we were on break, staff and Members have been working on that. As you know, we have invited the other side of the aisle, ranking members, to participate in that. Some have chosen not to, but we are hopeful that we  can move ahead on this, and we hope there is room for positive resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that. I do know that Senator Rockefeller in the other body has said that our intelligence is being downgraded and has made the case that the people that voluntarily complied don't get paid for it. He said, in fact: "What do they get for this? They get $40 billion worth of suits, grief, trashing, but they do it." Then he went on to say: "They don't have to do it, because they do have shareholders to respond to, to answer to."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there is a way to address this issue. We need to find it, and I hope we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, we had the Andean trade bill on the floor. This is a bill that allows access to our markets by Andean countries, including the country that we currently have a negotiated agreement with; and that country has changed dramatically since we put the first Andean bill in place 17 years ago. I'm wondering if the gentleman has any sense of where we might be on that outstanding agreement with Colombia. Certainly with the vote we took today they can continue to have the same kind of access  to our markets that they've had for the last 17 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A trade agreement would give us substantially new access to their markets, and I'd like to hear any sense of when we may get to that bill and have a situation where the President would be encouraged to send a bill up to us so we could get to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've had discussions recently with Secretary Gutierrez, with Ambassador Schwab and others, and Secretary Paulson, who have also discussed this issue with me and I know with you and with many others. This is an issue of importance. We think the discussions are ongoing. Hopefully, they will result in some fruitful resolution. That has not been the case at this point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did have, as you well know, a very significant interface with the administration last year in which I think a very positive result in terms of workers' rights and environmental concerns were addressed by us and by the administration. Unfortunately, we have not moved forward from that point on the other three agreements that were pending at that time, but I think that we will continue to have those discussions, hopefully positive and hopefully have some result.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. I do think since those discussions began the Colombian Government has made changes in the agreement in those areas, all of which have now been passed by the Colombian legislature, and I look forward to moving forward with that.</paragraph>
