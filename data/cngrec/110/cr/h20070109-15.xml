  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in its final report, the 9/11 Commission concluded, and I quote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The inability to communicate was a critical element of the World Trade Center, Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites where multiple agencies and multiple jurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this problem at three very different sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate communications among public safety organizations at the local, State and Federal levels remains an important problem. Federal funding of such interagency communication units should be given  high priority."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lack of interoperability among first responders has plagued our Nation for too long. Today Congress is taking an important step to give our first responders the tools they need to do their jobs and keep our Nation safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that, since September 11, the Republican administration and Congress failed to make adequate investments in interoperable communications for our police, firefighters and EMTs. After September 11, President Bush said, "We want to spend money to make sure equipment is there, strategies are there, communications are there to make sure that you have whatever it takes to respond." Yet under President Bush and the Republican-led Congress, the money was not allocated, the equipment was  not there, strategies were incomplete and first responders still could not communicate across agencies and jurisdictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Congress will consider the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act which will create a stand-alone grant program for interoperable communications. Today, the Democratic Congress starts a new direction for public safety and to keep America safe.</paragraph>
