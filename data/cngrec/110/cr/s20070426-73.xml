    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I just indicated in the consent approved, we will begin consideration of the FDA bill on Monday. In view of the consent being granted, I announce to both sides of the aisle that there will be no rollcall votes on Monday. We will vote Tuesday prior to the conference recess. So there will be votes Tuesday morning, and everybody should plan accordingly.</paragraph>
