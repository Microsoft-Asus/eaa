  <narrative>THE RETIREMENT OF GREG HARNESS -- (Senate - January 31, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="538">S538</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the distinguished and respected career of Senate Librarian Greg Harness, who retires today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Librarians serve as bridges, connecting information and resources with those who need it. They are charged not only as the keepers of knowledge but also as the distributors of it, and it is a duty that Greg has upheld in the most respectful, prompt, and accurate manner. Members of the Senate and their staff have come to rely on the vast resources that Greg oversees and know that each request for information, no matter how small it may seem, will be treated with the same courtesy and professionalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greg came to the Senate Library as a reference librarian in 1975, intending to stay only 2 years. Instead, Greg found his niche in the Senate Library, where he has worked for 32 years. He served in a variety of capacities over his tenure, transitioning to an assistant librarian position in 1995 and finally to Senate Librarian in 1997. One of his most important contributions was moving the Senate Library from the Capitol Building to the Russell Senate Office Building in 1999. Greg not only helped  facilitate the move, but he also oversaw the design of the new library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also worth noting that over the course of Greg's career, the field of librarianship has been transformed by new technology. In 1975, the Senate Library was the first Secretary of the Senate office to receive computers, allowing researchers to access information more quickly. For the Senate Library, this necessitated the need for research librarians who are not only knowledgeable of traditional paper-based resources but are also masters of electronic resources. Greg understands this balance  and has assembled a qualified staff to fulfill this need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From personal experience I can attest that Greg's tenure has been a welcome addition to the Senate Library's distinguished tradition of providing legislative, historic, and general knowledge to all that it serves. The Senate has been privileged to have Greg's expansive wealth of intellect and wisdom. I thank him for all the services he has provided to me, to other Members of the Senate, and to Senate staff. His service will be truly missed, and I wish him the best in his new endeavors.</paragraph>
