    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from American Samoa?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this proposed resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of our committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), and our senior ranking member of our committee, the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for their support and their leadership in bringing this important legislation before the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to bring to the floor today a bill that will benefit the entire Pacific region. I am honored and proud to sponsor this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While they may be overlooked when listing our great allies, the United States has long and profound relationships with the Pacific Island nations that stretch back more than two centuries. With consideration of this legislation today, Congress will act to significantly strengthen this vitally important alliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pacific Island nations have long been integral to our strategic interests, from the vital role they played in the Pacific theatre of operations during World War II to their critical role that they played in the conduct of our nuclear testing and missile defense system that even today is critical to our overall military and strategic interests in this important region of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We work closely with the nations of the Pacific to combat transnational threats, particularly the rapidly increasing peril posed by global warming. The people of the Pacific have also fought and sacrificed side-by-side with American soldiers in conflicts from World War II to the current war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as we look towards the Pacific, we must step up both our multilateral and bilateral relationships to provide critically needed assistance to ensure that other countries do not fill the void. Foreign assistance and scholarship offerings from other countries to the Pacific Island nations has increased dramatically in recent years. Such aid comes with few requirements for good governance and few environmental or labor standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line, Madam Speaker, our public diplomacy program and educational and cultural exchanges with the Pacific Island nations is shameful and without excuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Left unchecked, such foreign assistance from other countries can cause further instability, leaving these island nations to believe the United States no longer is interested to assist them, and thereby leave them vulnerable to establish friendships with countries that do not necessarily support our interests in this vast region of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must act now to fill the void and exert our influence. The Pacific Island Economic and Educational Development Act of 2007 seeks to address the development needs of our allies in the Pacific Islands and to engage the United States in the region more deeply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation pushes for greater activity in the Pacific Islands by authorizing the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development to listen to the needs of the leaders of the Pacific Islands and to provide assistance accordingly. This task would be significantly easier if USAID reestablished a serious presence in the Pacific Island region, something that has been long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also authorizes funds to increase the number of Fulbright scholars from the Pacific islands, making use of our most successful international educational program to increase the training of future leaders of the Pacific Islands. Fostering educational opportunities overseas is one of this government's strongest and most effective public diplomacy tools. Leveraging these grants would represent a tremendous way of reengaging with these critical allies in the Pacific region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under section 2 of this bill now entitled Pacific Island Country Exchanges, it is the intent of Congress to specifically increase funding for the U.S.-South Pacific Scholarship program, a program which has been in place since 1994, and has been administered by the East-West Center in Honolulu under the direction of the U.S. Department of State. The U.S.-South Pacific Scholarship program has successfully trained many Pacific Island leaders, and it is imperative to U.S. interests in the region  that we continue this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this new world where shipping is vulnerable to terrorism and climate change is a top priority, we need these Pacific Island nations as much as they need us. Let's commit to reengaging with them, to strengthening our alliances with them, and to aiding them in every way possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3062">H.R. 3062</bill>, the Pacific Island Economic and Educational Development Act. The island nations of the South Pacific, which include longstanding friends of the United States, face continuing challenges in development and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and the Global Environment (Mr. Faleomavaega) for his leadership in introducing this legislation and for working with us in the committee to refine it during the committee process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the amended text deals with authorizations, not mandates or appropriations, it signals congressional interest in deepening our cooperation with the people of the Pacific Islands, while also allowing executive branch agencies appropriate discretion in carrying out such programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The text before us will increase the amounts authorized for U.S. educational and cultural exchanges with South Pacific nations to $1 million in each of the next 2 fiscal years, establish a Fulbright exchange program for Pacific Island students, and underscore the interests of the United States Congress in making appropriate USAID technical assistance available to Pacific Island governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) for accommodating some of our suggested changes. I am pleased to support the amended text.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
