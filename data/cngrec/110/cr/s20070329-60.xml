    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 91, <bill type="h" number="137">H.R. 137</bill>, that the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me say to the majority leader, we are close to being able to get this measure cleared, but, regretfully, we are not there yet. So, therefore, I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, on this I am very disappointed. There are 3 million members of the Humane Society in America. For every one of them, this is their No. 1 issue; that is, to stop the viciousness, the barbarity of having animals fight each other. People bet on this, as we all know. It is done in several States, and it should be stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this is all about. I am not going to belabor the point, but this is something a number of people on both sides of the aisle feel strongly about. I would think in the next go-around whoever is objecting to this should step forward and state their objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to have to--on one of these days when there is not a lot to do; I don't know when that will be, but we will find some time--we are going to have to file cloture on this because it is unfair we are being stopped from moving on a bill that is entitled "Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act." I think that says it all.</paragraph>
