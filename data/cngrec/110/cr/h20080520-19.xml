    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to pose a question today, a question for the majority leadership of this House. My constituents are asking me, how high does the price of gasoline have to go before the Democrat leadership of this House decides to vote to allow domestic energy production? How much are Americans going to have to pay before they will bring our bills to the floor to address this issue? They are wanting to know. They also want to know why no refineries have been built since  1976. They want to know why permits seem to be slow walked when it comes to exploring for natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, my constituents in Memphis, Tennessee, are paying $3.63 for one gallon of gasoline. That's nearly 55 percent more than they were paying when Speaker Pelosi took over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are wanting answers. And what is the energy solution that the Democratic leadership has offered? Well, it has been banning the traditional light bulb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans want answers, Mr. Speaker, but even more, they want some action. They want the problem solved.</paragraph>
