    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the public service of Bob Hudson, city manger of Farmington, NM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob first came to New Mexico in 1982 to take on the job as director of parks, recreation &amp; cultural affairs in Farmington. Since that time he has served the citizens of Farmington faithfully, eventually becoming city manager in 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob's commitment to the community of Farmington did not end with his official duties. He has also served on the boards of several local organizations including the Boys &amp; Girls Club, the Farmington Inter-tribal Indian Organization, and the Chamber of Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The citizens of Farmington are well aware of Bob's contributions to their community and have honored him with numerous awards, including the New Mexico Distinguished Public Service Award in 1991 and the Elks Citizen of the Year award in 1995. Bob was also inducted into the History Makers Hall of Fame by the Farmington Chamber of Commerce in 2001 and the recipient of the 2005 Public Employee of the Year award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob is retiring in April to devote more time to his family, but I am sure his dedication to the community of Farmington will not end. I wish him the best in retirement and thank him for his long years of service.</paragraph>
