    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, as amended, in fact does amend title 40, United States Code, to provide a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severely and economically distressed regions of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007, authorizes two existing commissions and three new regional economic development commissions under a common framework of administration and management, and further provides a framework for good decisionmaking and planning. These commissions are designed to address problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment in their respective regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The five commissions are: the Delta Regional Commission, the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill models the administrative and management procedures for these five commissions after the highly successful Appalachian Regional Commission. The bill provides for a voting structure, provisions regarding staffing, conflicts of interest, local development districts, and other matters designed to produce a standard administrative framework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing a uniform set of procedures, this bill provides a consistent method for distributing economic development funds throughout the regions most in need of such assistance and ensures a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development where it is most needed in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Border Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, and the Southwest Border Regional Commission have been proposed in legislation introduced in this and in previous Congresses and are designed to address problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment in those regions. In addition, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Commission would be authorized through this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> authorizes funds for each commission to provide vital assistance for the development of our Nation's most chronically poor and distressed regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to say a few words about the uniqueness of each of the new commissions being authorized by this bill. The Southwest Border Region includes all counties within 150 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. This region contains 11 counties in New Mexico, 65 counties in Texas, 10 counties in Arizona, and seven counties in California, for a combined population of approximately 29 million residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to research compiled by the Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border, 20 percent of the residents of this region of the Nation live below the poverty level. Unemployment rates are often as high as five times the national unemployment rate, and a lack of adequate access to capital has created economic disparities and made it difficult for businesses to start up in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Border Region, stretching from Maine to New York, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind much of the Nation in its economic growth, and its people have not shared properly in the Nation's prosperity. The region's historic reliance on a few basic industries and on agriculture has failed to provide a diverse enough economic base for a vigorous self-sustained growth. In the belt of counties along the northern border from Maine through New York, 12.5 percent  of the population lives in poverty; median household incomes is about $6,500 below the national average; unemployment through layoffs in traditional manufacturing industries is persistent; and the population grew only by 0.6 percent between 1990 and 2000 while the U.S. population rose by 13.2 percent, showing significant out-migration and loss of young people in the northern border region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The southeastern portion of the United States, encompassing the States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, is an area which has seen poverty rates well above the national average, coupled with record unemployment. The region has also experienced natural disasters at a rate two to three times greater than any other region in the United States. The Southeast Crescent Authority authorizes a local-State-Federal partnership to lift citizens in this  geographic area out of poverty and create jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Federal allocation of funding, SECA seeks to funnel monies to programs which address one or more of the following criteria for the community betterment: infrastructure, education and job training, health care, entrepreneurship, and leadership development. Those communities with the greatest need will be targeted, and grants will be made according to the degree of distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has very broad and very bipartisan support, Mr. Speaker; and the committee has held a series of hearings that has documented the needs that these economic development commissions would address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I strongly support the bill, and urge passage of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="409888" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to express the regrets of the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Graves from Missouri, who was unable to be here and has asked me to explain the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, as amended, authorizes two existing economic development commissions, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission. The bill also creates three new economic development commissions, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act authorizes these five regional economic development commissions for 5 years, and provides a structure for economic development, decision-making and planning. The bill outlines conditions for financial assistance, authorizes grants to  local development districts. In addition, the bill establishes an Inspector General for the commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> provides a framework for administration and management. The framework is modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission structure, including membership, voting structure and staffing of the commission. Through the use of this common framework, this bill provides a consistency in distribution of economic development funds.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400274" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 represents a vision for economic development in our Nation that will help Americans in the most distressed region of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the northern border region, we have seen a clear, persistent pattern of economic distress. If you look at the 36 counties that lie on the border right next to the border between Maine and New York, you will find poverty above the national level average, median household income that is more than $6,500 below the national average. You'll see a persistent unemployment through layoffs and traditional manufacturing industry, and most striking of all, a meager gain in only 0.6 percent of the population  between 1990 and 2000, compared to a 13 percent growth nationally over the same period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Speaker, our mills are closing, our young people are leaving and too many of our workers are looking for work. Clearly, this region has a common set of challenges and a compelling need for investment and new growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mill worker for over 28 years at Great Northern Paper Company, I understand the particular challenges in the border regions of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York. Like my father and grandfather before me, I left high school and went straight to work in the paper mill in my hometown. After 28 years, and 2 days after I was sworn into Congress, the mill that I worked at went bankrupt, and my hometown was devastated. Unemployment rose to over 33 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story of my hometown and the mills where I worked has been repeated throughout the State of Maine and our region. That is why we need to support this region economic development bill. We have to support our regional industries and build on new job opportunities, and that is why we need to invest in leadership and focus in our regional economic development that the Northern Border Commission would bring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Border Commission would help the region invest in transportation, health care, agriculture, broadband and alternative energy. It can be a partner with businesses to maintain our industries and build new industry clusters. It can help us create jobs for the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all the ingredients that we need to face our challenges head on and make our region an economic engine. This new commission would help us make a fundamental change in our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working in a bipartisan manner on this bill. I'd like to thank the Chair of the full committee, Chairman Oberstar, and the Chair of the subcommittee, Ms. Norton, for their efforts as well, and also the former Chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Shuster, for all his hard work on the regional commission bills, as well as Congressman Hodes from New Hampshire who has been a true  leader in this particular area as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill represents a new way forward for economic development in our Nation for the places and the people that need it most. Let's pass this bill and give our people the hope and the future that they deserve</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join Congressman Michaud in expressing thanks to Chairman Oberstar and other members of the Transportation Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. This bill includes the Northern Border Regional Development Commission Act, the first bill I introduced as a Member of Congress, a bill with bipartisan support, and for which I extend a special thanks to Congressman Michaud, who has shown extraordinary leadership in the northern border region for economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, parts of my home State of New Hampshire, and especially the beautiful region known as the North Country, have taken an economic beating and are struggling to recover. A staggering number of jobs have been lost. We have watched as plants closed and our young people disappeared to places that offer more opportunity. New Hampshire's North Country has suffered repeated economic body blows, and for the people who live there, it's getting harder and harder to get by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I get up to the North Country quite frequently, and have spoken with hardworking folks with the drive to improve their neighborhoods, but whose communities have been ignored by the Federal Government for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you were to pick up the paper today, Mr. Speaker, you would see pictures of the smokestacks of once thriving pulp mills coming down, having been subject to explosives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the challenges New Hampshire's North Country face, and the sincere desire of the people there to turn things around and to create new jobs and new investments, there's a compelling case for leveraging Federal investment in the region. In fact, the northern border region, or the ice belt, which includes the northernmost counties of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, has higher unemployment, a higher percentage of people living in poverty, and lower household income than the  rest of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission created in this bill would be charged with investing Federal resources for economic development and job creation in the most distressed counties in that northern border region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By design and purpose, this bill follows the successful regional development models created in the mid 1960s to improve the economic standing of targeted regions in the South. Based on this successful model, the commission would create a unique Federal-State partnership charged with promoting development through regional planning, technical assistance and funding of projects aimed at encouraging economic prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill works like this: Community development districts and other nonprofits are encouraged to bring project ideas to the commission from the local level. This bottom-up, grassroots approach insures that actions reflect both local needs and regional economic development goals. It also insures that States have a deciding voice in what investment is made within their borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With a proposed budget of $40 million per year, the Northern Border Regional Development Commission can help meet a range of local needs. Whether the need is agricultural development, land and forestry conservation to maintain productive traditional uses, investment in transportation infrastructure, alternative and renewable energy or health care facilities, this commission will play a key role in investing in the region's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill says, if you're willing to work hard and play by the rules, we're here to help you get ahead. The communities in the northern border region deserve effective government working for them. The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act is an important first step toward providing good-paying jobs, economic opportunity and revitalized communities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to stress the bipartisan nature of this bill. I also want to stress the hearings we've held on this bill. As you might imagine, when people hear the word "economic development," everybody wants in. This has been a very rigorous process. We have bent over backwards, frontwards and sideways to be completely objective and to be open to Members on both sides of the aisles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's worth noting that all of the amendments that were added were requested by minority Members, our Republican colleagues. We're pleased to  do so. They were able to show the need in their respective districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, it seems to me, in light of the strong support it has had in our subcommittee and our committee, from Members from all parts of the country, and of all backgrounds and parties, in light of that fact, I urge passage of the bill, and I urge all Members to support this bipartisan bill for economic development for the underdeveloped regions of our country</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400264" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. I appreciate the work Chairman Oberstar and Representatives Graves, Hodes, and Michaud have done to develop this important legislation and bring it to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act is designed to alleviate systemic poverty and underdevelopment in our Nation's most severely economically distressed areas. These include rural Alaska, Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta region, the northern Great Plains region, the southeast crescent region, the southwest border region, and the northern border region, which includes all 11 counties that I have the honor to represent: Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Jefferson,  Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Oswego, and St. Lawrence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To provide a comprehensive, consistent and broad-based approach to economic and infrastructure development, <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> authorizes five regional economic development commissions. These commissions, modeled after the successful Appalachian Regional Commission, would have a uniform set of procedures and a common structure for administration, decision-making, management, and planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With funding authorized and provided by Congress, each Commission would make grants to States and local governments, Indian tribes, and public or nonprofit organizations for projects to develop transportation, public, and telecommunications infrastructure. These projects would also further efforts to provide job skills training, improve basic health care and related services, promote resource conservation, and development of both renewable and alternative energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituent counties, like many others within the northern border region, lag behind the rest of the Nation in economic growth and continue to experience higher than average levels of unemployment, poverty, and outmigration. Very simply, my constituents, as well as those who live in the other affected areas, should no longer be left behind. Moreover, I am confident that with the assistance provided through <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the economies of all the impacted counties will improve, thus resulting in  an enhanced quality of life for all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007, which will help spur economic development in my district of El Paso, TX. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his vision regarding the need and importance of regional authorities for development in areas of the country with huge economic need. For the past three Congresses, I have introduced my bill, the Southwest Regional Border Authority Act,  in an attempt to bring some relief to the United States-Mexico border and my district of El Paso, TX. This year, under the leadership of Chairman Oberstar, my bill has been included into his overall legislation. I would also like to thank many of my colleagues who represent districts along the United States-Mexico border for their support in the creation of the Southwest Regional Border Authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chairman's bill would authorize $1.25 billion over the period of FY 2008 through FY 2012 for five regional commissions one of which will be created in the United States-Mexico border region. The Authorities would be Federal-State partnerships for providing assistance to economically distressed and underdeveloped areas that have experienced high levels of unemployment, poverty, or out-migration. Three of the commissions would be new and would assist areas in the southeastern United States  and areas along the Mexican and Canadian borders; two of the commissions would replace existing Authorities in the Delta and northern Great Plains regions. The bill would establish uniform administrative structures and responsibilities for the commissions, and authorize the commissions to provide financial assistance for projects and programs in their respective regions to develop transportation and infrastructure, provide job skills training and support business development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Southwest border region, as defined in the bill, includes all counties within 150 miles of the United States-Mexico border. This region contains 11 counties in New Mexico, 65 counties in Texas, 10 counties in Arizona, and 7 counties in California, with a combined population of approximately 29 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to research compiled by the Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border, 20 percent of the residents in my region live below the poverty level, unemployment rates often reach as high as five times the national average, and a lack of adequate access to capital has created economic disparities, making it difficult for businesses to start up in the region. Border communities have long endured a depressed economy and low-paying jobs. Our economic challenges  partly stem from our position as a border community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Economic development in border communities is difficult to stimulate without assistance from the government, private sector, and community organizations. <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> would help foster planning to encourage infrastructure improvements, technology deployment, education and workforce training, and community development through entrepreneurship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeled in part after the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Authority and other Authorities would follow four guiding principles:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Authorities would fund proposals designed at the local level followed by approval at the State level in order to meet regional economic development goals;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, projects leading to the creation of a diversified regional economy would be prioritized. Currently, States and counties often are forced to compete against each other for limited funding;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the Authorities would be independent agencies. This would prevent them from having to attempt to satisfy another Federal agency's mission requirements when determining which projects to fund; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Authorities would be comprised of one Senate-confirmed Federal representative and the governors of the States of jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, many areas of our country including the Southwest border region have been ignored, overlooked, and underfunded. We need to recognize the challenges facing these underserved areas and help them make the most of their many assets. I believe the Authorities created in the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 would go a long way toward achieving the goal of economic prosperity in some of the poorest regions of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on this issue and look forward to the implementation of this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007, reauthorizes two existing commissions, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission, and establishes three new regional economic development commissions: the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission. These Commissions will address problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment in their respective  regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation authorizes all of these regional commissions under a common framework of administration and management, modeled after the procedures for the highly successful Appalachian Regional Commission. By providing a uniform set of procedures, this bill provides a consistent method for distributing economic development funds and ensures a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severely distressed regions in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> authorizes $250 million per year for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for each commission to provide vital assistance for the development of our Nation's most chronically poor and distressed regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of the three new commissions authorized by this bill serves a unique need. The Southwest border region includes all counties within 150 miles of the United States-Mexico border. This region contains 11 counties in New Mexico, 65 counties in Texas, 10 counties in Arizona, and 7 counties in California for a combined population of approximately 29 million people. According to research compiled by the Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border, 20 percent of the  residents in this region of the Nation live below the poverty level, and unemployment rates often reach as high as five times the national unemployment rate. A lack of adequate access to capital has created economic disparities and made it difficult for businesses to start up in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The northern border region stretches from Maine to New York. While the region enjoys abundant natural resources and is rich in potential, it lags behind much of the Nation in economic growth, and its people have not shared equitably in the Nation's prosperity. The region's historic reliance on a few basic industries and agriculture has failed to provide a diverse enough economic base for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. In the countries in this region, 12.5 percent of the population lives in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The southeastern region of the United States includes the coastal and central portions of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. Approximately 40 percent of the counties in this region have had 20 percent or more of their citizens living in poverty, on average, during the last 30 years. The area has also faced record unemployment. Additionally, this region has experienced natural disasters at a rate of two to three times greater than any other region  of the U.S. The southeastern region is one of the last areas of the country without a Federal authority dedicated to ending poverty and strengthening communities. The Southeast Crescent Authority (SECA) authorizes a local-State-Federal partnership to lift citizens in this geographic area out of poverty and create jobs by targeting the communities with the greatest need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has broad bipartisan support, and the committee has held a series of hearings regarding the need for these economic development commissions. The model for economic development through partnerships between the Federal Government and State and local governments has worked extremely well in the case of the Appalachian Regional Commission, and I am certain it will continue to serve to enhance the lives and livelihoods of citizens in other regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit an exchange of letters regarding jurisdiction, and I support HR. 3246 and urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, September 17, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN OBERSTAR: I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding regarding consideration of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the "Regional Infrastructure Development Act of 2007," which was referred to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and reported to the House on September 7. Specifically, I appreciate your acknowledgement of the Committee on Agriculture's jurisdictional interest in provisions contained in the bill that affect rural development programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, clause 1(a) of Rule X gives the Committee on Agriculture jurisdiction over bills that affect rural development programs. Given the importance of moving this bill forward promptly, I would be glad to waive any consideration of this measure as to allow its timely consideration by the entire House of Representatives. However, I do so with the understanding that this procedural route will not be construed to prejudice the Agriculture Committee's jurisdictional interests and prerogatives  on this bill, or any other similar legislation, and will not be considered as precedent for consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to the Agriculture Committee in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, in the event a conference with the Senate is requested in this matter, I would ask you to support the Committee on Agriculture's request to be represented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much for your courtesy in this matter and I look forward to your continued cooperation between our Committees as we deal with these matters in the future.</paragraph>

Your support for this legislation and your assistance in ensuring its timely consideration are greatly appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree that provisions in the bill are of jurisdictional interest to the Committee on Agriculture.

  <speaking speaker="400266" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007, which provides a comprehensive regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in the most severely economically distressed regions in the Nation. This bill includes legislation that I have introduced in every Congress since the 107th Congress that will establish a SouthEast Crescent Authority for economic development. The authority would cover the southeastern  portion of the United States, encompassing the States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, which have all seen poverty rates well above the national average coupled with record unemployment--the double whammy--poverty and unemployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to personally thank the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Oberstar and his Ranking Member, Mr. Mica, and the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Economic Development Chairwoman Holmes Norton and the Ranking Member, Mr. Graves, for their hard work and dedication to our Nation's most economically disadvantagd regions. It is their compassion, cooperation, and commitment that brought us here today, and I applaud them  for their efforts to continue this cause, and I thank them for their friendship and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member that represents a district from one of the Southern States that has experienced job growth stagnation, I have seen first-hand the restructuring of the South's economy. Jobs in textiles and furniture-making have decreased substantially while jobs in retail, services, and the professions have rushed in. Although a more high-tech and globally competitive economy has enabled new opportunities for employment in the South, it has also dismantled jobs long held by employees who have few  prospects for shifting to other jobs with comparable pay. In addition, the seven States of the SECA region also experience natural disasters at a rate of two to three times greater than any other region of the United States, and this vulnerability to natural disasters further exacerbates the ability to recover from economic distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeled primarily after the successful Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the SouthEast Crescent Authority hopes to enjoin a local-State-Federal partnership to lift our citizens out of poverty and create jobs. With the Federal allocation of funding, SECA seeks to target monies to programs which address one or more of the following criteria for community betterment: (1) infrastructure, (2) education and job training, (3) health care, (4) entrepreneurship, and (5) leadership development. Those  communities with the greatest need will be targeted, and grants will be made according to the degree of distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the time is now to work to change this pattern and ensure that those individuals--like those in my district who work in textiles or manufacturing--and those communities--like the many rural communities that have been affected--are not left behind. And I am confident that the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 that is before us today will be able to do just that. It's the least we can do to act now and help "the least of these" who have suffered enough  and to help bolster economic progress and possibility. Thank you, and may God bless our efforts to help expand economic opportunities for all of our citizens and their families.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Regional Economic and In Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the distinguished Chairwoman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Subcommittee, Ms. Norton, the Full Committee Chairman, and the Ranking Members for delivering this legislation which authorizes three new economic development commissions--the Northern Border, Southeast Crescent, and Southwest Border Regional Commissions--and reauthorizes the successful Delta and Northern Great Plains Regional Commissions. These Commissions will help bring  economic development to regions of our country that desperately need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several decades, Upstate New York has had a consistent pattern of economic distress as a result of substantial losses in the manufacturing sector, coupled with aging infrastructure and lack of opportunities for a skilled workforce. My district alone has seen a staggering loss of more than 14,000 manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2005. However, this isn't an anomaly, it is extremely characteristic of several States in the Northeast. A targeted regional approach can help bring back  economic vitality to these regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation creates a Northern Border Regional Commission that will bring much needed job creation and economic development resources to the Northeast region. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Upstate New York will all benefit tremendously from the establishment of this Commission because it will assess and address the very specific needs, assets, and challenges of the region as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commission will create a Federal-State partnership where local development districts and other non-profits bring project ideas and priorities to the Commission from the local level to promote economic development  through regional planning, technical assistance, and funding of projects aimed at encouraging economic prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Northern Border Regional Commission is modeled after the very successful Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) approach, an idea conceived by Chairman Oberstar, over 40 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, the numbers speak for themselves. Since its creation, the ARC has reduced the number of distressed counties in its region from 219 to 100, cut the poverty rate from 31 percent to 15 percent, and helped 1,400 businesses create 26,000 new jobs. I welcome the creation of similar Commissions with this kind of proven track record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Border Regional Commission not only will extend benefits to economically distressed counties in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, but will also allow Upstate New York counties like Oneida, Herkimer, Cayuga, and Seneca to enjoy the same benefits their neighboring counties in the Southern Tier enjoy under the Appalachian Regional Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to act now to ensure that every American has access to job training, employment-related education, and high-tech infrastructure, so that we can retain and grow our global competitive edge. And I am confident the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act will help us achieve that end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which will help create parity for economically anemic regions across the country.</paragraph>
