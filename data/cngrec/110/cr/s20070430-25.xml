    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I today I honor the late Helen Robson Walton. Helen touched countless lives within her community, across Arkansas and throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on December 3, 1919, in Claremore, OK, Helen graduated college in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Oklahoma School of Business. Two years later she married Sam Walton and they formed a lasting relationship of love, friendship and as business partners. Helen and Sam Walton opened their first retail store, a Ben Franklin "five and dime" in Newport, AR, in 1945.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The daughter of a successful lawyer, banker and rancher, Helen had a natural instinct for good management and played an active role in the family business. She firmly believed in the concept of family partnerships and insisted that their four children--Rob, John, Jim and Alice--were partners of Walton Enterprises. At the time, they were all under the age of 10.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Helen was also admired for her graceful, down-to-earth demeanor. She was active in the First Presbyterian Church in Bentonville and the first woman ever elected to vice chairwoman of the board of trustees for the Presbyterian Church, USA, Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a natural leader who recognized the importance of putting others before self, Helen devoted a large portion of her time to the Walton Family Foundation. Under her leadership, the foundation has given generously to numerous Arkansas organizations, including the University of Arkansas, the Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville and Crystal Bridges. Her commitment to education has also touched hundreds of lives in Central America. Since 1985, she personally supervised a $3.6 million scholarship program  for Central American students to study at John Brown University in Siloam Springs, University of the Ozarks and Harding University in Searcy. Knowing the vast majority of these students would return home, Helen wanted to provide them with higher educational opportunities so they could later contribute to the well-being and economic development of their local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her generosity of time, energy and goodwill towards others is an example we all can follow. I join Arkansans in offering my prayers and condolences for the Robson and Walton families during this difficult time.</paragraph>
