    <paragraph>Madam President, the Senate today gave final Congressional approval to a comprehensive $463.5 billion funding resolution. The vote today was the culmination of many weeks of determined effort by Senators and Members of the House from both parties, and from their talented staffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take a moment to thank Senators for their support for this legislation, and to the members of the Appropriations Committee, Democratic Senators and Republican Senators, for their determination and effort to reach this milestone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was not easy legislation to craft. Members and staff took on the difficult task of wrapping the funding of every domestic department and agency into a single bill, without Congressional earmarks and within very austere budget limitations. It was one of the most complex processes that the Appropriations Committee has undertaken in recent memory. But it was a challenge that we met in a smart, innovative way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Appropriations Committee staff: Staff Director Terry Sauvain; Deputy Staff Director Charles Kieffer; Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA clerk Galen Fountain; Commerce, Justice, Science clerk Paul Carliner; Defense clerk Charlie Houy; Energy and Water clerk Doug Clapp; Financial Services clerk Marianne Upton; Interior clerk Peter Kiefhaber; Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education clerk Ellen Murray; Legislative Branch clerk Nancy Olkewicz; Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs clerk Christina Evans; State and Foreign Operations clerk Tim Rieser; and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development clerk Peter Rogoff; their associate staffs; Communications Director Tom Gavin and Communications Coordinator Cindy Huber; Deputy Chief Clerk Elnora Harvey; and professional staff members Jack Conway and Bob Knisely. Senators know the value</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a bipartisan effort, and I want to pay tribute to Senator Thad Cochran, the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, his staff director Bruce Evans, and the Republican subcommittee staffs. They were partners in producing this balanced funding legislation, and their ideas and input were invaluable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only was the writing of this legislation a bipartisan process, but it also was a bicameral one. House Appropriations Chairman Dave Obey and his staff, and Ranking Member Jerry Lewis and his staff, were integral to the success of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This final funding package is an example of how the Congress can work together, without regard to party lines or partisan positions. this legislation focuses not on Democratic priorities or Republican priorities, but rather on national priorities of health care; law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts; education, medical care for our troops and our veterans; and energy independence. We invest resources wisely in an effort to meet the country's needs today while building the foundation for  a stronger America tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senators for their support of this legislation, and I look forward to continuing this bipartisan effort on the Fiscal 2008 appropriations legislation.</paragraph>
