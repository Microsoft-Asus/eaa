    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Specialist Dane R. Balcon, who passed away on September 5, 2007, in Balad, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Specialist Balcon died of injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. Dane's mother, Carla, resides in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and his father, John, lives in Miami, Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From an early age, Dane dreamed of the opportunity to serve his country. His path to the military began at Sand Creek High School in Colorado Springs, where he joined the Army ROTC program. The assistant principal at Sand Creek remembered Dane as an outstanding person and someone who had an absolute love for the military and serving his country. Immediately following graduation, Dane enlisted in the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Balcon comes from a proud tradition of military service. Both his mother and father served in the military. I am grateful for their service and their selfless dedication to this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Balcon was a remarkable soldier and a devoted son who honorably served the Nation he loved. Making the ultimate sacrifice, he died protecting our freedom and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank him, Specialist Dane R. Balcon, for his service to our country, and I offer my deepest, heartfelt condolences to his family.</paragraph>
