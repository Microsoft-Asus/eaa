    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think most of us as Republicans want to be able to provide health care access to low-income uninsured children, but that is not the issue or the bill that comes to the floor today. As we have heard from many of the speakers, it is to cover all children despite income levels and despite whether or not they are currently enrolled in a health insurance plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, one of the Republican amendments that was denied in the Rules Committee and we cannot bring to the floor today is a measure that would say if you are currently enrolled in health insurance, you are not eligible to participate in SCHIP. That is denied, and that is just one piece of evidence that we are going to bring out today showing that this is an attack on private health insurance coverage and the attempt to nationalize health care.</paragraph>
