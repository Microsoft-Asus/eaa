    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>) denouncing the practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor" killings, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that participation, protection, recognition, and independence of women is crucial to achieving a just, moral, and honorable society, as amended.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas human rights violations against women occur around the world and are not limited to times of war, and have been committed for political gain, personal advantage, ethnic hatred, and in the name of deities and fundamentalist religious zeal; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in many parts of the world, there is a culture of violence and discrimination which denies women rights equal to those of men and which legitimizes the exploitation of women for personal gratification, political purposes, and financial gain; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas despite the fact that in 1998, the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda set a precedent in international law by establishing and prosecuting rape and sexual violence in times of violent conflict as war crimes and crimes against humanity, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict in the 21st century; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas former Bangladeshi Prime-Minister Sheikh Hasina acknowledged that every year in Bangladesh up to 200 women are horribly disfigured by acid attacks by their spurned husbands or suitors, leaving many of them blind, deaf, or dead; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas according to Amnesty International, 6,000 women are subjected to genital mutilation each day in North Africa, and 135,000,000 women, in at least 46 other countries, have undergone female genital mutilation worldwide; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Time Magazine reports that about 25,000 women in India each year are doused with gasoline, set on fire, and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small, and four out of five of these attacks are not reported to or recorded by law enforcement agencies; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in many societies baby girls are denied food, drowned, suffocated, abandoned, or their spines are broken simply because they are born girls; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in China, where the male-child is traditionally prized above the female, the "one-child" state policy has multiplied the rate of abandonment, sex-selective and forced abortion and female infanticide, and yielded a skewed population demographic; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Chinese demographics have exacerbated the abduction, trafficking, and sale of Asian women and girls for the purposes of sex slavery and forced marriage; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Amnesty International estimates that this year, more than 15,000 women will be sold as sexual slaves in China; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, according to World Bank figures, at least one in five women and girls around the world has been beaten or sexually abused in her lifetime; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the 2002 Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe estimates that the leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 through 44 is the violence to which they are subjected in their own homes, and in the Russian Federation alone, every day 36,000 women are beaten by their husbands or partners;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas in the United States, every day four women die as a result of domestic violence, every year more than half a million women are battered, every year 4,000,000 women are physically abused by their husbands or domestic partners, one-third of American women report physical or sexual abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives, over 324,000 pregnant women are victims of intimate partner violence annually, the majority of welfare recipients have experienced domestic violence  as adults, and domestic violence causes  100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 visits to a doctor each year; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, the theme for the 2007 United Nations International Women's Day was "Ending Impunity for Violence Against Women and Girls"; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas UNAIDS asserts that the best way to prevent HIV is to raise the status of women because a woman's vulnerability to HIV infection is in direct proportion to her lack of control over the risks of infection; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the inequalities between women and men have persisted and major obstacles remain, with serious consequences for the well-being of all people; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the situation of women is exacerbated by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of the majority of the world's people, in particular women and children; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas families rely on mothers and wives for emotional support, labor, and income needed to raise healthy children and care for other relatives; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, according to the United Nations, nearly 70 percent of the people who live in abject poverty are women and women perform two-thirds of the world's work, earn less than five percent of its income, and own less than one percent of its property; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas democracy, political stability, and economic development are linked to the welfare of women and children, yet the United Nations estimates that three of every four illiterate adults in the world are women and two-thirds of children denied primary education are girls; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the exclusion of women from the political process in many countries makes them even more vulnerable to abuse; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas as long as women and girls are undervalued, overworked, and subjected to violence in and out of their homes, the potential of the human family to create a peaceful, prosperous world will not be realized; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the leadership of women is strongly linked to social justice, economic prosperity, political stability, peaceful relations, and a healthy population: Now, therefore, be it &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) denounces the barbaric practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor" killings, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions and crimes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) asserts that women are not chattel, should not be trafficked, exploited, or sold for services, and should not be denied the right to education, to ownership of property, or to participate in full, economic, social and political life;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) demands the cessation of these barbaric practices and the dismantling of social and institutional mechanisms which perpetuate systematic discrimination against women and girls;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) calls on all governments to pass enforceable laws banning these practices, prosecute any individuals who persecute or violate women and girls with these acts, and pass measures to empower women and girls and afford them equal access to educational, social, and economic opportunities; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) calls on the President and fellow donor countries to promote the rights, health, and empowerment of women in every aspect of their foreign assistance to developing countries, and discourage continued acts of violence against women and the impunity that often accompanies these acts; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) participation, protection, recognition, health, and equality of women and girls are crucial to achieving a just, moral, and peaceful society; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (B) regardless of religion, geography, or form of government, women should not be denied their human rights, and those rights must be defended and enforced when they are abridged, challenged, or violated.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>, denouncing the practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor" killings, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the participation, protection, recognition, and independence of women is crucial to achieving a just, moral, and honorable society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allow me to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for working with my staff and working collaboratively to bring forward this legislation that really is a statement of our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also thank the staff who worked on this bill. The full committee: Kristin Wells, Pearl-Alice Marsh, Joan Condon and Yleem Poblete. I also thank the members of my staff: Yohannes Tsehai, Nina Besser and Samia Elshakie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very important as we move forward in making this statement that we recognize that we are attempting to save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May I share with my colleagues the loneliness of being a woman anywhere in the world where they're not protected against brutality, dowry killings, honor killings, and that they have no refuge and no opportunity to address their grievances in their own Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I show you some of the dastardly pictures, horrific that they are, showing how women are burned, how women are scarred, and how women are beaten all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for the United States to join in making a very pronounced statement because women are lonely, and they need the statement or the support of women and this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs, as I indicated, my good friend and colleague, Congressman Lantos, again, and as well the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent decades, women have made crucial strides toward equality. Our daughters now have a wide range of options and opportunities, and they can look forward to a life full of promise. Despite this important progress, women and girls throughout the world, including here in our own Nation, continue to face gender-based persecutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many parts of the world, a culture of violence and discrimination persists, denying women rights equal to those of men, and legitimizing the exploitation of women for personal gratification, political purposes and financial gain. My legislation strongly denounces such practices and reaffirms the societal values of the independence of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Human rights violations against women and girls know no borders. They take place throughout the world on six continents. Statistics are shocking. In North Africa, 6,000 women are genitally mutilated each day. Over 7,000 women in India are killed by their families and in-laws in disputes over dowries annually. A woman in Pakistan was raped by a person in the military, and no one was willing to address her grievances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 15,000 women will be sold as sexual slaves in China this year. Two hundred women in Bangladesh are horribly disfigured when their spurned husbands or suitors burn them with acid each year, according to the Bangladesho Prime Minister.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2002 Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe estimates that the leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes. In the Russian Federation alone, every day 36,000 women are beaten by their husbands or partners. Even here in the United States, a woman is raped every six minutes, and a woman is battered every 15 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these practices are contrary to international law. In 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda issued a groundbreaking verdict with the successful prosecution of rape as a tool of genocide. Further prosecutions under the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia solidified rape as a crime of war and as the basis for prosecution for torture. Despite these ever-evolving legal traditions, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict  in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very proud of the Foreign Affairs Committee because we work in a bipartisan manner, and therefore, this legislation was able to come out of the committee in a bipartisan manner. And so, as we look to be of help, this is an important forward step in acknowledging the brutality towards women around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to rape, another persistent form of gender-based persecution is female genital mutilation. Despite existing laws forbidding this practice, this tradition is often embedded  in cultural, religious and nonmedical practices, making it more difficult to overcome. Such traditions legitimize the exploitation of women for personal gratification and political gain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation faced by women worldwide is intricately tied to a number of other issues that we have addressed in recent months in the committee. Women and children are particularly affected by extreme poverty, which exacerbates the obstacles they face. Nearly 70 percent of those living in abject poverty are women, according to the United Nations. And while women perform two-thirds of the world's work, they earn less than 5 percent of all income, and they own less than 1 percent of all property.  The United Nations estimates that three of every four illiterate adults in the world are women, and two-thirds of children denied primary education are girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to thank the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend and colleague Congressman Lantos, for his support and his leadership on this important issue. I have been pleased to work with the Committee on this legislation, and I would to thank the Committee staff for their work on this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, democracy, political stability, and economic development are linked to the welfare of women and children. This Congress has announced its commitment to all three of these admirable goals, and I firmly believe that if we are truly dedicated to building and supporting stable, open, and prosperous societies throughout the world, we must work to eliminate these practices of serious persecution and discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the time is long since passed for us to strongly declare that women are not chattel, should not be trafficked, nor sold for services, and must not be denied the right to own property. The fundamental rights to freedom of worship, expression, association, conscience and pursuit of happiness ought never to be threatened by violence, oppression, slavery, or manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation denounces the barbaric practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, `honor' killings, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions. It demands the cessation of these barbaric practices and condemns the perpetrators. Regardless of religion, geography, or form of government, women should not be denied equal rights, which should be defended when their rights are abridged, challenged, or violated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress, I strongly urge you to join me in supporting this extremely important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>, which denounces violence against women and recognizes that women's rights are, indeed, human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to thank Chairman Lantos and the sponsor of this resolution, my good friend and my chairwoman, Ms. Jackson-Lee, for agreeing to modify the introduced text such that it strikes all references to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. By striking these references and refocusing our attention on the challenges to human dignity that an alarming number of women are forced to endure around the world, <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill> is now a much stronger,  bipartisan resolution which can be universally embraced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill> recognizes that democracy, political stability, public health and economic development are linked to the welfare of women and children. Two-thirds of the world's work is performed by women, yet women still earn less than 5 percent of its income, own less than 1 percent of its property, and make up nearly 70 percent of the people living in poverty unfortunately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lack of legal standing of women in many societies makes them especially susceptible to poverty, exploitation, abuse and, inevitably, infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet as women serve as the provider and educator for their families in many traditional societies, their exploitation threatens the prosperity of their entire family and community. As such, the resolution calls upon governments to address the entrenched gender inequalities which threaten development, as well as national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also calls on governments to criminalize such atrocious practices as female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor" killings, acid burnings, dowry deaths, and other gender-based crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution does not seek to bestow upon women any special privilege. It simply recognizes the fact that no matter where one lives, and no matter what their race, religion or culture, we are all human beings who deserve the opportunity to live in dignity and free from oppression or abuse based solely on our gender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge unanimous support of <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am prepared to close at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank my very generous friend Mr. Bilirakis from Florida for expressing the negotiations that occurred in the Foreign Affairs Committee and the spirit in which we work in that committee by coming together in a bipartisan way to make such an important statement today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to indicate that democracy, political stability, and economic development are linked to the welfare of our women and children. This Congress has announced its commitment to all three of these admirable goals, and I firmly believe that if  we are truly dedicated to building and supporting stable, open and prosperous societies throughout the world, we must work to eliminate these practices of serious persecution and discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished gentleman from Florida has indicated that we're doing this together. The time has long since passed for us to strongly declare that women are not chattel, should not be trafficked, and not sold for services and must not be denied the right to own property. The fundamental rights to freedom of worship, expression, association, conscience and pursuit of happiness ought never to be threatened by violence, oppression, slavery or manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation denounces the barbaric practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor" killings, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions. It gives women hope around the world. It demands a cessation of these barbaric practices and condemns the perpetrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm delighted to be supported by Amnesty International; the United Nations Women's Fund; the CARE, Council on American-Islamic Relations, equal rights advocates; and NOW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also delighted to be able to have this Congress express that regardless of religion, geography or form of government, women should not be denied equal rights, should have the opportunity to be defended when their rights are abridged, challenged or violated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in the spirit of protecting the women around the world from the violence that they experience and suffer every day from the trafficking and from the inhumane treatment, I ask my colleagues to enthusiastically support <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amnesty International USA commends Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee and the U.S. House of Representatives for authoring and considering <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill> to denounce the practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor" killings, acid burning, dowry deaths and other gender-based persecution and to urge participation, protection, recognition and independence of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violence against women is a human rights scandal. At least one out of every three women has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime. In Europe, domestic violence is the major cause of death and disability for women aged 16 to 44. In the United States, a woman is raped every 6 minutes; a woman is battered every 15 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rape of women is widespread in armed conflicts such as in Colombia and Darfur. Trafficking of women has become a global phenomenon where victims are sexually exploited, forced into labor and subjected to abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Murders of women in Guatemala, Russia, India, and other countries often go uninvestigated and unpunished. The experience or threat of violence affects the lives of women everywhere, cutting across boundaries of wealth, race and culture. In the home and in the community, in times of war and peace, women are beaten, raped, mutilated, and killed with impunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. government should move forward in ratifying the Treaty for the Rights of Women (CEDAW)--the most complete international agreement on basic human rights for women. The United States played an important role in drafting the Treaty, which 185 nations have ratified as of October 2007. As the leading superpower, U.S. ratification would lend weight to the Treaty and provide valuable support to women seeking reforms in countries around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amnesty International USA encourages members of the U.S. House of Representatives to move quickly towards passage of <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill> and encourages all members of the legislative body to actively work to stop violence against women throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TO THE HONORABLE SHEILA JACKSON LEE: The U.S. National Committee for UNIFEM is in full support of <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill> which denounces the practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that participation, protection, recognition, and independence of women is crucial to achieving a just, moral, and honorable society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread violations of human rights. Since 1976, UNIFEM (the women's fund at the UN) has provided financial and technical assistance to innovative programs focusing on ending gender-based violence including initiatives to eliminate FGM, dowry murders and domestic violence. In 1996, the UN General Assembly established the UN Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence Against Women. Managed by UNIFEM, the Trust Fund is the only multilateral  grant-making mechanism that supports local, national and regional efforts to combat violence. While the Trust Fund has provided over $13 million to 226 projects in over 100 countries, the need for stricter laws, education and advocacy efforts to end gender-based violence persist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. National Committee for UNIFEM is one of 16 national committees that support UNIFEM. We work to increase the visibility of UNIFEM in the U.S. and promote campaigns and events to support UNIFEM's four strategic areas: reducing women's poverty, ending gender-based violence, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and supporting women's leadership. We are devoted to working toward a world where women and girls live free from violence, poverty and inequality. With Congress's support of this bill,  we can ensure that we come one step closer to this goal. We applaud your efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President, U.S. National Committee </paragraph>

    <paragraph>AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 8, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN JACKSON LEE: The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) expresses its support for <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>, denouncing female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor killings," acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based human rights violations against women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CAIR joins in calling for an end to such barbaric practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perpetrators of these barbaric acts claim any number of philosophical, political or religious justifications. CAIR, drawing on our faith's admonition to establish justice, stands with those who reject such justifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CAIR, America's largest Muslim civil liberties group, has 33 offices, chapters and affiliates nationwide and in Canada. Its mission is to enhance the understanding of Islam, encourage dialogue, protect civil liberties, empower American Muslims, and build coalitions that promote justice and mutual understanding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of House Resolution 32 the Denouncement to the Suppression of Women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thousands of women a year fall victim to societies that deem them unworthy and in turn suffer at the hands of discrimination and violence. We must recognize that this violence is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women and it must be eliminated. Too many women are continuously tortured, beaten, mutilated and assaulted by husbands, fathers, and complete strangers without hope for support or promise of a safe haven to run to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domestic violence is the major cause of death and disability for women aged 16 to 44, accounting for more death and ill-health than cancer or traffic accidents. More than 60 million women are "missing" from the world today as a result of sex-selective abortions and female infanticide. The World Health Organization has reported that up to 70 per cent of female murder victims are killed by their male partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans, citizens striving to preserve human life and oppose the discrimination of any person, we must move to impair these malevolent occurrences in full force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>United, we must denounce these demeaning practices and fervently demand an end to this persecution and a commitment to preserving the rights of female populations all over the world. No longer can we stand silent while thousands of women fall victim to cultural prejudice and international trafficking. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The preservation of female rights must be a priority to this the 110th Congress as we continue to work towards ensuring democratic ideals worldwide.</paragraph>
