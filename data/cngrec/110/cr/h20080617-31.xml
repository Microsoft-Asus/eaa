    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5710">H.R. 5710</bill>, as introduced by our colleague, Congressman Tom Udall of New Mexico, would direct the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to assist in the design and the construction of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System. The project would provide a sustainable water supply to nine communities and an Air Force base. This bill has received bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlelady from Guam has, once again, in her role as the bill manager, adequately explained the legislation that has been introduced by our colleague from New Mexico, Tom Udall. And it is also supported by our committee colleague, the ranking member on the Energy and Mineral Resources subcommittee, himself an expert on energy, STEVE PEARCE. Both of them are trying to seek to provide alternative water sources to communities in eastern New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing that is not contemplated in this bill is, of course, how much energy it will take to pump the water over almost 100 miles of pipeline. Water pumping costs for this project will require massive amounts of electricity. It is unclear on how we, as a country, are planning on generating that electricity in the future. But since commitments have been made to work on specific committee report language involving land owner rights and military contributions to this particular water project,  we certainly have no objection at this point to this bill and would also urge a favorable vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400413" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5710">H.R. 5710</bill>, The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act. In so doing, I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Chairwoman Napolitano for their efforts in bringing this legislation to the floor today. This important bill will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities in eastern New Mexico develop the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System (ENMRWS).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has long been a recognized need for a reliable and safe supply of potable water for eastern New Mexico. After years of drought and ever-increasing community growth, this water supply project is now absolutely critical for the continued economic well-being of Curry and Roosevelt counties in eastern New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These eastern New Mexico counties are built on a strong agricultural heritage, and the communities are known for their great sense of unity and mutual support. With the threat of extreme water scarcity, eastern New Mexico counties are rallying to ensure community survival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ogallala aquifer currently provides 100 percent of the municipal and industrial water supplies and the vast majority of agricultural water for eastern New Mexico. However, both the quantity and quality of this groundwater reserve have declined severely in recent decades. It is estimated that this groundwater supply will not be able to sustain current use into the next decade, and may be functionally depleted within 25 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 45 years, water users in eastern New Mexico have worked to develop an alternative source of municipal water that will be sustainable into the future. The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Supply Authority, consisting of nine communities in the Curry and Roosevelt counties of eastern New Mexico, was formed in 2001 to oversee the development of a rural water system. This Authority has expeditiously and effectively finalized the studies and planning necessary to move forward with this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act is the result, and it has come after years of research, years of consultation, years of planning, and years of negotiation. The legislation is strongly supported by the communities involved, by the state of New Mexico, and by the entire New Mexico Delegation. <bill type="h" number="5710">H.R. 5710</bill> passed by unanimous consent in both subcommittee and full committee, and it is my hope that the bill will continue to garner strong bipartisan support on the floor today  and in the Senate as it moves to that chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the efforts of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Supply Authority, of the state of New Mexico, and of the counties and cities involved in this project. They have worked expeditiously and tirelessly to finalize the studies and planning necessary to move forward with this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The establishment of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System is essential to the socio-economic survival of communities in eastern New Mexico. While vital to New Mexico, <bill type="h" number="5710">H.R. 5710</bill> is just one piece in the larger puzzle of water resources in the arid west and across the nation. As our nation is confronted with changing and extreme weather, states and communities must work to address water scarcity with conservation efforts, with new technology, and with negotiation of water rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5710">H.R. 5710</bill> builds on the ongoing efforts of the 8 cities and counties participating in the  project. These communities are working to establish innovative approaches to conserving water both agriculturally and domestically. They are part of a movement in the west to recognize the limitations of this precious resource and to work within these limitations to build strong communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act is key to the survival of numerous New Mexico communities, and is part of a wider national approach to sound water management. We cannot stand by and watch vibrant communities dissolve into western ghost towns, especially when solutions exist. I encourage my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5710">H.R. 5710</bill> and help provide a positive, long-term solution to a pressing water need in the rural West.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of passage of <bill type="h" number="5710">H.R. 5710</bill>, the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act, which will establish the Ute water pipeline. This bill authorizes construction of a pipeline from the Ute Reservoir that will carry water to several communities in Curry and Roosevelt counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the proposed bill, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is authorized to spend up to $327 million to assist the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Authority (ENMRWA) in the construction of the pipeline. The State of New Mexico and the ENMRWA, which represents communities in eastern New Mexico that will benefit from the pipeline, will contribute 25 percent of the cost of construction. ENMRWA will operate and maintain the pipeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Construction of this pipeline is essential as communities in eastern New Mexico try to meet future demand for water. It will provide a critical supply of water to growing communities and create certainty in these communities that safe, clean water will continue to be available long into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ute Reservoir was built on the Canadian River in 1959 as a sustainable water supply for eastern New Mexico. It has been nearly 40 years since Congress authorized the study of a pipeline to transfer water to communities in eastern New Mexico, but only in the past few years have the affected New Mexico communities began planning for the pipeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Communities that will be served by the Ute pipeline include Grady, Clovis, Melrose, Texico, Portales and Elida, as well as Cannon Air Force Base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a cosponsor of this important legislation and urge its swift passage.</paragraph>
