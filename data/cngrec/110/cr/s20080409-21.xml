  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I rise to recognize April as National Autism Awareness Month. As many as 1 in 166 children is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders each year, yet the cause and cure remain unknown. Our commitment to finding answers and solving the puzzle of autism must continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the diagnosis of autism is the beginning of a challenging road, it can also be the welcome end to a frustrating process for families. Early detection is an important step towards obtaining appropriate treatment to ensure children are able to grow to reach their full potential. As the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders continues to grow, we must also ensure these treatment options are available in our communities and accessible to those who need them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also take this opportunity to recognize the parents, professionals, and advocates who work day after day to be a powerful voice for autistic individuals. They create an important network to share information, experiences and challenges, as well as to celebrate accomplishments. We must all join them in their efforts to pursue increased funding for biomedical research and public health awareness campaigns, education programs that reflect special needs, and expanded diagnosis and treatment options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all citizens to support the search for the cause, cure and prevention of autism and support those individuals and families who live with this challenging disorder on a daily basis.</paragraph>
