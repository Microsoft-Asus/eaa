  <narrative>
    <bill type="sr" number="575">S. Res. 575</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the veterans of the United States have been vital to the small business enterprises of the United States; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Nation should honor its veterans and in particular those veterans with disabilities incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during active service with the United States Armed Forces; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congress passed the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-50; 113 Stat. 233) to assist veterans interested in starting or expanding small businesses; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 required the President to establish a goal of awarding not less than 3 percent of the total value of all Federal prime contracts and subcontracts to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congress approved the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-183; 117 Stat. 2651) to expand benefits for veterans; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 gave agency contracting officers the authority to reserve certain procurement contracts for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13360 (60 Fed. Reg. 62,549) in 2004, calling on Federal agencies to more effectively implement the legislative changes to the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) included in the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 and the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, despite those Acts of Congress and the issuance of Executive Order 13360 by the President, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses still struggle to receive a fair share of Federal contracts; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Federal agencies have consistently fallen short of the statutory contracting goal for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses set by the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999: Now, therefore, be it &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate-- &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) reaffirms the strong support of the United States for its veterans and veteran entrepreneurs; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) calls on Federal agencies to work to improve Federal contracting opportunities for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. &lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution that is cosponsored by Senator Murkowski, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, Senator Cochran, Senator Isakson, Senator Craig, and Senator Snowe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am submitting this resolution to honor veteran entrepreneurs and calling on the Federal Government to improve Federal contracting opportunities for service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses. They call them SDVOSBs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These veteran entrepreneurs have given so much to our country, and the Federal Government needs to honor them by utilizing their array of valuable skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost 9 years ago, Congress passed the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999, which directed the President to establish a goal of awarding at least 3 percent of Federal contracts to service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In subsequent years, however, the Federal agencies have consistently failed to reach that statutory goal. In the most recent official governmentwide report, contract awards for service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses made up less than 1 percent of all Federal contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I travel home this weekend to observe Memorial Day, I will have the great honor of being accompanied by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Dr. James Peake, who has accepted my invitation to visit our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Peake, a decorated combat veteran and former Army Surgeon General, is an exceptional American. An important challenge for the VA will be to provide adequate VA health facilities and services to veterans in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Peake's decision to travel from our Nation's Capital to Alaska on this important holiday shows his commitment to all veterans, particularly those who come from rural areas.</paragraph>
