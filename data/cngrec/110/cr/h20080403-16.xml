    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during Read Across America Week, I went to Lincoln Elementary School in Memphis, Tennessee, and we read our favorite book, "Green Eggs and Ham." I asked the young people if they ever watched C-SPAN, and they looked at me quizzically. Then I asked them if they ever watched Nickelodeon, and they all raised their hand and cheered. I said, "Which show do you watch the most?" They watch "The Naked Brothers Band."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Naked Brothers Band is a show on Nickelodeon that has been an award winner starring Nat and Alex Wolff, produced by their mother, Polly Draper, and co-produced by their father, Michael Wolff. It is the "Ozzie and Harriet," the Nelson brothers of the 21st century, and it shows that there is good television that gives kids good values and teaches them about the environment and how to be good young people and grow up to be great Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my congratulations to the Nickelodeon Network and to the Wolff-Draper family and Nat and Alex.</paragraph>
