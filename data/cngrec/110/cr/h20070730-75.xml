  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act". &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Congress finds as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration began operation on October 1, 1958, with about 8,000 employees and an annual budget of $100,000,000.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Over the next 50 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been involved in many defining events which have shaped the course of human history and demonstrated to the world the character of the people of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Among the many firsts by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) On December 6, 1958, the United States launched Pioneer 3, the first United States satellite to ascend to an altitude of 63,580 miles.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) On March 3, 1959, the United States sent Pioneer 4 to the Moon, successfully making the first United States lunar flyby.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) On April 1, 1960, the United States launched TIROS 1, the first successful meteorological satellite, observing Earth's weather.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) On May 5, 1961, Freedom 7, carrying Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., was the first American space flight involving human beings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) On February 20, 1962, John Glenn became the first American to circle the Earth, making three orbits in his Friendship 7 Mercury spacecraft.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 became the first spacecraft to commit a successful planetary flyby (Venus).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) On April 6, 1965, the United States launched Intelsat I (also known as Early Bird 1), the first commercial satellite (communications), into geostationary orbit.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) On June 3-7, 1965, the second piloted Gemini mission, Gemini IV, stayed aloft for 4 days and astronaut Edward H. White II performed the first EVA or spacewalk by an American.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (I) On June 2, 1966, Surveyor 1 became the first American spacecraft to soft-land on the Moon.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (J) On May 31, 1971, the United States launched Mariner 9, the first mission to orbit another planet (Mars) beginning November 13, 1971.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (K) On April 12, 1981, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched the Space Shuttle Columbia on the first flight of the Space Transportation System (STS-1).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (L) On June 18, 1983, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched Space Shuttle Challenger (STS-7) carrying 3 mission specialists, including Sally K. Ride, the first woman astronaut.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (M) In another historic mission, 2 months later the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched STS-8 carrying the first black American astronaut, Guion S. Bluford.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (N) On July 23, 1999, the Space Shuttle Columbia's 26th flight was led by Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a Shuttle mission.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) On April 9, 1959, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration unveiled the Mercury astronaut corps, 7 men with "the right stuff": John H. Glenn, Jr., Walter M. Schirra, Jr., Alan B. Shepard, Jr., M. Scott Carpenter, L. Gordon Cooper, Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom, and Donald K. "Deke" Slayton.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy, reflecting the highest aspirations of the American people, proclaimed: "I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish."&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) On September 19, 1961, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration center dedicated to human space flight would be built in Houston, Texas.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) On February 17, 1973, the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) On December 21, 1968, Apollo 8 took off atop a Saturn V booster from the Kennedy Space Center for a historic mission to orbit the Moon.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) As Apollo 8 traveled outward, the crew focused a portable television camera on Earth and for the first time humanity saw its home from afar, a tiny, lovely, and fragile "blue marble" hanging in the blackness of space.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) This transmission and viewing of Earth from a distance was an enormously significant accomplishment and united the Nation at a time when American society was in crisis over Vietnam, race relations, urban problems, and a host of other difficulties.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin made the first lunar landing mission while Michael Collins orbited overhead in the Apollo command module.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) Armstrong set foot on the surface, telling the millions of listeners that it was "one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"; Aldrin soon followed and planted an American flag, but omitted claiming the land for the United States as had routinely been done during European exploration of the Americas.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) The 2 Moon walkers left behind an American flag and a plaque bearing the inscription: "Here Men From The Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon. Jul. 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace for All Mankind.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) On April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into space aboard the STS-31 mission of the Space Shuttle Discovery and since then the Hubble has revolutionized astronomy while expanding our knowledge of the universe and inspiring millions of scientists, students, and members of the public with its unprecedented deep and clear images of space.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) On July 4, 1997, the Mars Pathfinder landed on Mars and on January 29, 1998, an International Space Station agreement among 15 countries met in Washington, DC, to sign agreements to establish the framework for cooperation among the partners on the design, development, operation, and utilization of the Space Station.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (16) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's stunning achievements over the last 50 years have been won for all mankind at great cost and sacrifice; in the quest to explore the universe, many National Aeronautics and Space Administration employees have lost their lives, including the crews of Apollo 1, the Space Shuttle Challenger, and the Space Shuttle Columbia.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (17) The success of the United States space exploration program in the 20th Century augurs well for its continued leadership in the 21st Century; this leadership is attributable to the remarkable and indispensable partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its 10 space and research centers as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) From small spacecraft to supercomputers, science missions and payloads to thermal protection systems, information technology to aerospace, the Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley provides products, technologies, and services that enable NASA missions and expand human knowledge.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) The Dryden Flight Research Center, the leading center for innovative flight research.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) The Glenn Research Center, which develops power, propulsion, and communication technologies for space flight systems and aeronautics research.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) The Goddard Space Flight Center, which specializes in research to expand knowledge on the Earth and its environment, the solar system, and the universe through observations from space.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the leading center for robotic exploration of the Solar System.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) The Johnson Space Center, which manages the development, testing, production, and delivery of all United States human spacecraft and all human spacecraft-related functions.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) The Kennedy Space Center, the gateway to the Universe and world leader in preparing and launching missions around the Earth and beyond.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) The Langley Research Center, which continues to forge new frontiers in aviation and space research for aerospace, atmospheric sciences, and technology commercialization to improve the way the world lives.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (I) The Marshall Space Flight Center, a world leader in developing space transportation and propulsion systems, engineers the future to accelerate exploration and scientific discovery.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (J) The Stennis Space Center, which is responsible for rocket propulsion testing and for partnering with industry to develop and implement remote sensing technology.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (18) The United States should pay tribute to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and to its successful partnerships with the space and research centers, by minting and issuing a commemorative silver dollar coin.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (19) The surcharge proceeds from the sale of a commemorative coin would generate valuable funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Families Assistance Fund for the purposes of providing need-based financial assistance to the families of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration personnel who die as a result of injuries suffered in the performance of their official duties.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material therein.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allow me, first of all, to acknowledge the chairperson of the Financial Services Committee as I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>, the NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. Chairman Frank has been an outstanding leader of his committee and has been very gracious in the formulating and finalizing of this legislation. I thank him again. I thank his staff and, of course, the staff of the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Culberson), who joined me in introducing this legislation. And, of course, we have worked very handily together, if you will. I thank his staff. And together we are committed to affirming and celebrating the 50th anniversary of NASA and as well the 50th anniversary of the Jet Propulsion Lab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just quickly acknowledge the founding of NASA in October, 1958, and remind my colleagues of all the successes that we have accomplished through the belief, as John F. Kennedy said, that we can explore space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I acknowledge and remind my colleagues of February 20, 1962, John Glenn's becoming the first American to circle the Earth. On April 6, 1965, the United States launched Intelsat I. On November 13, 1971, Mariner 9 was launched. In 1981, NASA launched the space shuttle Columbia. And on June 18-24, 1983, NASA launched the space shuttle Challenger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Of course, we have faced some sad moments in NASA's history, but overall, as we look toward the future and have reflected on July 22, 1999, Space Shuttle Columbia, and then of course July 20, 1969, Apollo 11, we know that tragedy has faced NASA, but we also know that we have faced tragedy with a certain determination and commitment to space exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This coin bill will, in fact, allow us to commemorate a number of the centers and the 50 years of success of NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab. But it also will provide a comfort to those families of Challenger and Columbia by providing aid to the families. It will give the coin collectors, I hope, a great day of celebration, and it will give those who are interested in studying and producing more Americans in math and science an opportunity to promote and support programs that  will encourage young people to go into math and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this bill is one that all of us can support. It is a bipartisan bill</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>, the NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. I would like to thank my colleague Mr. CULBERSON, who joined me in introducing this legislation, and Chairman FRANKS of the Financial Services Committee, for his excellent leadership in shepherding this historic legislation to passage on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The year 2008 will mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This important legislation celebrates NASA's 50th birthday with a commemorative coin. The legislation also honors the extraordinary partnerships between NASA and its 10 space and research centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, NASA has a distinguished history. The United States of America won the race to land a man on the moon and, thanks to the courage, dedication, and brilliance of NASA, America has continued to lead the world in the exploration of the solar system and the universe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 1, 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began operation. At the time it consisted of only about 8,000 employees and an annual budget of $100 million. Over the next 50 years, NASA has been involved in many defining events which have shaped the course of human history and demonstrated to the world the character of the people of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us remember how inspired we were when on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy proclaimed: "I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always at the forefront of technological innovation, NASA has been home to countless "firsts" in the field of space exploration, from the 1958 launch of Pioneer 3, the first U.S. satellite to ascend to an altitude of 63,580 miles, to the January 1998 signing of the International Space Station agreement between 15 countries, establishing the framework for cooperation among partners on the design, development, operation, and utilization of the Space Station. Over the past 50 years, NASA's  accomplishments have included:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 20 Feb. 1962, John Glenn became the first American to circle the Earth, making three orbits in his Friendship 7 Mercury spacecraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 6 Apr. 1965, the United States launched Intelsat I, the first commercial satellite (communications), into geostationary orbit. On 13 Nov. 1971, the United States launched Mariner 9, the first I mission to orbit another planet (Mars).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 12 Apr. 1981, NASA launched the Space Shuttle Columbia on the first flight of the Space Transportation System (STS-1).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 18-24 Jun. 1983, NASA launched Space Shuttle Challenger (STS-7) carrying three mission specialists, including Sally K. Ride, the first woman astronaut. In another historic mission, two months later NASA launched STS-8 carrying the first black American astronaut, Guion S. Bluford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 22 Jul. 1999, the Space Shuttle Columbia's 26th flight was led by Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a Shuttle mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin made the first lunar landing mission while Michael Collins orbited overhead in the Apollo command module. Armstrong set foot on the surface, telling the millions of listeners that it was "one small step for man--one giant leap for mankind." Aldrin soon followed him out and planted an American flag but omitted claiming the land for the U.S. as had routinely been done during European exploration of  the Americas. The two Moon-walkers left behind an American flag and a plaque bearing the inscription: "Here Men From Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon. Jul. 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace for All Mankind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into space aboard the STS-31 mission of the Space Shuttle Discovery. The Hubble has revolutionized astronomy while expanding our knowledge of the universe and inspiring millions of scientists, students, and members of the public with its unprecedented deep and clear images of space."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in addition to these historic events, NASA has greatly contributed to our understanding of our universe. In 1968, Apollo 8 took off atop a Saturn V booster from the Kennedy Space Center for a historic mission to orbit the Moon. As Apollo 8 traveled outward, the crew focused a portable television camera on Earth and for the first time humanity saw its home from afar, a tiny, lovely, and fragile "blue marble" hanging in the blackness of space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This transmission and viewing of Earth from a distance was an enormously significant accomplishment and united the Nation at a time when American society was in crisis over Vietnam, race relations, urban problems, and a host of other difficulties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the United States space exploration program in the 20th Century augurs well for its continued leadership in the 21st Century. This success is largely attributable to the remarkable and indispensable partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its 10 space and research centers. One of these important research centers is located in my home city of Houston. The Johnson Space Center, which manages the development, testing, production, and delivery of all  United States human spacecraft and all human spacecraft-related functions, is one of the crown jewels of NASA and a lodestar Houston area. The other nine research and space centers are:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. The Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley provides products, technologies, and services that enable NASA missions and expand human knowledge in areas as diverse as small spacecraft and supercomputers, science missions and payloads, thermal protection systems and information technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. The Dryden Flight Research Center, the leading center for innovative flight research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. The Glenn Research Center, which develops power, propulsion, and communication technologies for space flight systems and aeronautics research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. The Goddard Space Flight Center, which specializes in research to expand knowledge on the Earth and its environment, the solar system, and the universe through observations from space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the leading center for robotic exploration of the Solar System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>6. The Kennedy Space Center, the gateway to the Universe and world leader in preparing and launching missions around the Earth and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>7. The Langley Research Center, which continues to forge new frontiers in aviation and space research for aerospace, atmospheric sciences, and technology commercialization to improve the way the world lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>8. The Marshall Space Flight Center, a world leader in developing space transportation and propulsion systems, engineers the future to accelerate exploration and scientific discovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>9. The Stennis Space Center, which is responsible for rocket propulsion testing and for partnering with industry to develop and implement remote sensing technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NASA's stunning achievements over the last 50 years have been won for all mankind at great cost and sacrifice. In the quest to explore the universe, many NASA employees  have lost their lives, including the crews of Apollo 6, the Space Shuttle Challenger, and the Space Shuttle Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The surcharge proceeds from the sale of a coin commemorating the contributions of NASA will generate valuable funding for the NASA Families Assistance Fund for the purposes of need-based financial assistance to the families of NASA personnel who die as a result of injuries suffered in the performance of their official duties. And equally important, proceeds from the sale of commemorative coins will also benefit the Dr. Ronald E. McNair Educational, DREME, Science Literacy Foundation, which is  dedicated to improving and strengthening the process of teaching and learning science, math, and technology at all educational levels, elementary through college through the promotion of innovative educational programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also benefits the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence which is dedicated to building critical thinking skills, experiential teaching methods, science literacy, and integrated approaches to learning and individual responsibility in achieving excellence. The remainder of the proceeds after distribution to the NASA Families Assistance Fund and the DREME and Jemison Foundations are slated to go the Smithsonian Institution for the preservation, maintenance, and display of space  artifacts at the National Air and Space Museum (including the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in the centuries to come, when space travel will be commonplace and America will have successfully led the way for humanity to colonize and utilize the resources of other planets, these first 50 years of NASA's existence will be remembered as the most significant era of human space exploration. It is, therefore, important that we commemorate the great achievements of NASA's first 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Madam Speaker, let me also thank the Staff of the Financial Services Committee on this legislation. I also wish to pay special tribute to Yohannes Tsehai and Gregory Berry of my staff. Without their valuable contributions this significant legislative achievement would not have been possible. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this historic legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this time, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400089" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume in support of <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to, first of all, thank the chairman of the committee, Chairman Frank, for his insistence in bringing this bill to the floor throughout this process. I want to thank my colleague from Houston, Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE. Thank you so much, SHEILA. It's been a pleasure working with you on this important bill honoring the 50th anniversary of NASA, an organization whose exploration of outer space has truly touched the lives and hearts, I think, of every American  today, can relate to the experience I know so many Americans had on the 31st of January, 1958, when the very first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, was launched into orbit. In response to the Soviet Union's launching of Sputnik, the Jet Propulsion</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So next year is a golden anniversary for NASA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has given the people of the United States many, many things to be proud of. NASA has gone on to explore, from that first launch of that first satellite, the entire solar system and much of the visible universe with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now have telescopes in orbit, Madam Speaker, around the Earth that have identified up to 160 planets around other solar systems. NASA has discovered, with the Mars Rovers, that liquid water not only once existed on the surface of Mars, but it appears that there are large frozen lakes on Mars today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have landed on the surface of the moon, Titan. We not only landed men on the moon with a very successful Apollo program, but we are today, under President Bush's vision and the leadership of our new NASA administrator, Mike Griffin, rapidly moving towards the day very soon when men and women will return to the surface of the moon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The accomplishments of NASA, JPL, and all of the research labs under NASA are absolutely extraordinary, but this exploration has not come without loss. As with all exploration that is new, it has been dangerous. On January 27, 1967, America tragically lost three Apollo astronauts on the launch pad because of a fire in Apollo I. Changes were made to the program, and the spacecraft became much safer and we moved on and beyond that terrible tragedy. And then of course we lost the Space  Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, with its entire crew, a terrible day that I know many of us remember. And then most recently, tragically, on February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia was lost during reentry with its entire seven-man crew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, in the design of this coin set, my coauthor and I, Congresswoman Jackson-Lee, have proposed that the centerpiece of the coin will be a $50 high-relief-proof gold piece that will honor the lives of the astronauts who have lost their lives in the exploration of space. On that $50 gold piece will be an image of the sun. Then arranged around it will be nine silver-proof dollars, each one representing a different planet in our solar system and each one commemorating missions to  that planet as put together by each of the different NASA centers. And the silver dollar for the planet Earth will of course have on the reverse side a design emblematic of the Apollo mission as well as Earth orbital missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This commemorative coin set, Madam Speaker, is just one small piece of ongoing work that Congress is doing in support of NASA. And it's really difficult to measure the value of what NASA has done for the United States and for all mankind in exploring space. Asking what NASA has done for the United States and for all of humanity is a little like the question facing Americans 200 years ago when Congress authorized the Lewis and Clark Expedition. No one knew at the time what Lewis and Clark might  find. They didn't know what resources might lie out there. They did not know what the unchartered blank spots on the western American map would yield. And it was impossible, 200 years ago, to measure the value of the discoveries, the minerals, the animal species, the incredible new horizons that Lewis and Clark would discover; no way to measure that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think equally here today, Americans standing on the brink of the 21st century cannot place a value or measure on the discoveries that the men and women of NASA, our brave astronaut core and all the scientists and engineers who work at NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard, the Applied Physics Lab, and all the research centers around the country that have helped the American space program lead the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud to be a lead coauthor on this bill and helping honor the men and women of NASA and the extraordinary discoveries that NASA has made, and also to remind Americans of the value we each enjoy with miniaturization of computers, medical technology, heart pumps, valves, power generators, image processing, cell phone technology, CAT scanners, MRI machines. All of the extraordinary technological innovations that we touch on a daily basis have come from our work on the space program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be here today with my coauthor, Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, on a bill that is strongly supported in a bipartisan way. It was passed unanimously last Congress. I am confident we will enjoy that kind of support today for this coin set honoring NASA's 50th anniversary.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very happy to see this bill here today; one, because it is important that we commemorate NASA. And secondly, as a tribute to the persistence of the gentlewoman from Houston and the gentleman from Houston, I am particularly glad that we are passing this bill because it will mean I will get an extra 2 hours a week because I've spent about 2 hours a week talking to them since January. So for both reasons, I am very happy that this very worthy bill  is about to pass</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit the following correspondence:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 30, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR BARNEY: I am writing regarding <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>, the NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means maintains jurisdiction over bills that raise revenue. <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill> contains a provision that establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill, and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as part of our ongoing understanding regarding commemorative coin bills and in order to expedite this bill for Floor consideration, the Committee will forgo action. This is being done with the understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming this understanding with respect to <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC. July 30, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHARLIE: I am writing in response to your letter regarding <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>, the "NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act," which was introduced in the House and referred to the Committee on Financial Services on June 15, 2007. It is my understanding that this bill be scheduled for floor consideration shortly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to confirm our mutual understanding on this bill. As you know, section 7 of the bill establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill. I acknowledge your committee's jurisdictional interest in such surcharges as revenue matters. However, I appreciate your willingness to forego committee action on <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill> in order to allow the bill to come to the floor expeditiously. I agree that your decision to forego further action on this bill will not prejudice  the Committee on Ways and Means with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation. I would support your request for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction should this bill be the subject of a House-Senate conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will include this exchange of letters in the Congressional Record when this bill is considered by the House. Thank you again for your assistance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If I could yield quickly for a point of legislative intent clarification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I notice the intent of my cosponsor that these centers, and I agree completely, they all need to be recognized and honored, but of course the front of the coin is going to represent each one of the nine planets. And it is your intent, as I know it is mine, that the reverse of the coin reflect and honor the research center that contributed to missions to that particular planet is what I'm confident you mean.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cosponsor <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>, which directs the United States Treasury to create a commemorative coin honoring the 50th Anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). From the early space flights of the 1960s to Neil Armstrong's "small step for mankind" to last year's successful missions of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and the Space Shuttle Discovery, NASA's has a long and impressive record of accomplishments that should  be a source of pride to all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a representative of the Gulf Coast of Texas, which is home to many of NASA's most significant triumphs, I have had the opportunity to meet many NASA employees. I have always been impressed by their professionalism and dedication to their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What philosopher Ayn Rand wrote of the moon landing in 1969 applies to all of NASA's missions: "Think of what was required to achieve that mission: think of the unpitying effort; the merciless discipline; the courage; the responsibility of relying on one's judgment; the days, nights and years of unswerving dedication to a goal; the tension of the unbroken maintenance of a full, clear mental focus; and the honesty. It took the highest, sustained acts of virtue to create in reality what had only  been dreamt of for millennia." I encourage all of my colleagues and all Americans to join me in commending NASA for 50 years of accomplishments by supporting <bill type="h" number="2750">H.R. 2750</bill>.</paragraph>
