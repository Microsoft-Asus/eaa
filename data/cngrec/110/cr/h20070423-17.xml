    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="119">H. Res. 119</bill> recognizes this week as National Crime Victims' Rights Week in order to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of victims and survivors of crime in the United States during this week and throughout the year. Obviously, we are very attuned to victims this week as we mourn the tragic deaths and injuries of the Virginia Tech shootings last week, though this resolution was scheduled for victims generally, without any reference to specific victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the last year for which we have compiled figures, there were 24.2 million criminal victimizations of people over the age of 12 in the United States. Of those, 5.4 million were violent victimizations and 18.6 were property victimizations. Unfortunately, there were many more crimes than those figures suggest. It is estimated that only 48 percent of violent crimes and only 38 percent of property crimes are reported to police in each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked about the large group of victims in the resolution preceding this one involving sexual assault victims. Clearly we want to be aware of the need of victims of all crimes and do whatever we can, not only to address victimizations that occur but also to prevent the crimes occurring in the first place. Supporting the mission and goals of the National Crime Victims' Rights Week will increase the public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of victims and survivors of crime, and I  urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="119">H. Res. 119</bill>, honoring National Crime Victims' Rights Week. This resolution supports the missions and goals of National Crime Victims' Rights Week to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of crime victims in the United States during this week and throughout the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The theme of the 2007 National Crime Victims' Rights Week is "Victims Rights: Every Victim, Every Time." In honor of every victim, we renew our commitment to protecting the rights of crime victims and to providing them effective assistance programs. We also commend the countless numbers of professionals and volunteers who dedicate their lives to helping victims and survivors of crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week is marked by many special events held across the Nation, including the national observance and candlelight ceremony held here in Washington, DC, a 5K run/walk and Victims' Rights Fair in Sierra Vista, Arizona, a Crime Victims' Rights Rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and many more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these events provide excellent opportunities to focus on victims rights, this is an issue that requires our utmost attention year-round. That is why it is encouraging that there are over 10,000 victims assistance programs providing emotional, financial, physical and spiritual support every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Virginia said, a week honoring the victims and survivors of crime is especially poignant following last week's tragedy at Virginia Tech. The loss of innocent lives affects so many others who are left behind. The outpouring of prayers and condolences reminds us that victims and survivors of crime will not be forgotten and will continue to receive much needed community support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a cochairman of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, along with Congressman Ted Poe, we rise today in support of House Resolution 119, the 2007 National Crime Victims' Rights Week resolution, expressing the sense of Congress' support for Victims' Rights Week and the efforts to increase public awareness in the United States and throughout the country with everything that is occurring, as my colleagues have indicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Congressman Scott for their leadership on victims issues and for helping bring this bill to the floor today, as well as the gentlewoman from West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allow me to begin by sending our thoughts and prayers to those victims, the wounded, the friends and the families who were touched by the tragedy at Virginia Tech last week. We as Members of Congress and throughout the country are wearing these ribbons symbolic to remind all of us that in our Nation, and in the world, crime knows no boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Victims of crimes are sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, parents, neighbors and friends. They are those who are struggling to survive the aftermath of crime, and therefore they deserve our support. They deserve the services to help them cope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I came to Washington 3 years ago, I discovered that there was a void in the leadership on victims issues, so together with my colleague, Congressman Ted Poe, we developed the bipartisan voice for victims in Congress, the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, which we together cochair. For Members and staff who are listening today, we welcome your participation in this Crime Victims' Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the caucus, we have introduced this legislation to recognize the fact that, as most Americans know all too well, crime knows no country, no geographic, no demographic, and no political boundary, and it touches all of our communities, unfortunately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution before you provides support for Victims Rights Week and the Crime Victims Fund, which are two legacies of a former President of ours, President Ronald Reagan. Let me give you some of the history of how the Crime Victims Fund started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all in 1980, President Reagan, with bipartisan support in Congress, called for a national observance to recognize and honor victims of crimes and their families and survivors. The Democratic majority in the Congress back in the 1980s supported that effort. This week also pays tribute to the thousands of community service providers, those providers throughout our country, that give critical support to victims every week of the year. Victims Rights Weeks have been observed annually, therefore,  across the Nation since 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the Congress and President Reagan at the time's commitment to rights of victims led to the passage of what then became known as the Victims of Crime Act, which in 1984 created a Crime Victims Fund. The concept behind the fund is smart and it is simple: We take fines levied on criminals and distribute that money to the victim services providers, those which we talked about. The concept behind that effort is that it is not taxpayers' dollars, it is money that comes from those fines levied on  criminals, and they distribute the money to those care providers throughout the Nation. Therefore, let me emphasize, this is not taxpayers' dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, for the third year in a row, this administration is trying to take that money meant for victims and to put it in the abyss of our current efforts to balance the general fund. I might support that if in fact these were taxpayers' dollars, but they are not. These are criminals' dollars that are levied for their criminal act. It is simply wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 2 years, the Crime Victims Caucus led the effort to protect that fund, and we are doing so again this year. As long as I am in Congress, I will continue to fight any effort that would effectively deny services to those victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you what the Crime Victims Fund has done over the years. It has dedicated more than $8 billion annually and supported more than 4,400 victim assistance programs throughout  the country that has benefited over 3.8 million. It helps get beds in domestic violence shelters, it helps ensure that rape victims receive proper counseling, and, sadly, sometimes it even has to go to help families pay for funeral expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fund, therefore, plays a critical role in all of our communities throughout the country. Several groups which I am proud to represent in my own district include but are not limited to the Marjorie Mason Center in Fresno, the Kern, Fresno and Kings County Probation Departments, Clinica Sierra Vista, the Rape Counseling Service of Fresno and the Comprehensive Youth Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our caucus is committed to ensuring that this fund is used for what President Reagan intended: to help victims who truly need and deserve their assistance and to hold offenders accountable, as the Congress intended to do in 1984.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, the National Crime Victims' Rights Week theme is "Victims Rights: Every Victim, Every Time."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This week from April 22 through April 28, observances are taking place throughout the country in thousands of communities, as indicated by my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, last year the FBI Uniform Crime Reports found that crime again is on the rise. Violent crime rose by 3.7 percent. Murders increased by 1.4 percent, and robberies were up by 10 percent. This means that victims suffered the indignation of crime and have significant losses that affect them physically, emotionally, and financially. Our caucus and our Congress must recommit our energies to ensure that "every victim of every crime" has access to support and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, we must talk to the millions of Americans who are victimized each year. We must recall that every violent crime has a victim and every victim has a story. We know about the teenage girl who leaves home for the first time to go to college, to be impacted by a rape; or the young mother who is beaten by her husband on a regular basis but fears leaving him because he has threatened to kill her kids and she has no money and no place to go. Every victim, every time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, we must do everything we can. The 22 leading national organizations have come out in official support of the Victims' Rights Week resolution including the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, Justice Solutions, National District Attorneys Association, National Children's Alliance, National Coalition against Domestic Violence, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and the National Center for Victims  of crime. I include the full list for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Victims Organizations Official Support for <bill type="hr" number="119">H. Res. 119</bill></paragraph>
    <paragraph>Organization: Justice Solutions; National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators; National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children; American Probation and Parole Association; National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center; the National Judicial College; American Society of Victimology; National Center for Victims of Crime; National Alliance To End Sexual Violence; National Organization for Victim Assistance; Stop Family Violence; Mothers Against Drunk Driving; The National Coalition  of Victims in Action; National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards; National Coalition Against Domestic Violence; National Network To End Domestic Violence; National District Attorneys Association; Jewish Women International; National Children's Alliance; Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections; Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network; Security on Campus, Inc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me close by recognizing one victim advocate in particular for her valuable contribution in this field throughout the country, and her friendship and support of crime victims, Anne Seymour. She helped Congressman Ted Poe and I organize the Crime Victims Caucus 2 1/2  years ago. People like Anne and all the organizations I mentioned are where the rubber meets the road. They are the direct providers, meeting the needs of victims every day. They truly are the unsung heroes, and this  resolution honors their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Victims Crimes Caucus is committed to working with victims, service providers, and advocates to ensure that from the courtroom to the U.S. Capitol, the voices of crime victims are heard. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this significant resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is a champion of crime victims rights and a member of the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recognition of National Crime Victims' Rights Week continues the legacy of an individual who committed himself to elevating the status of crime victims in this country. Among the many contributions made during his Presidency, President Ronald Reagan's leadership and vision in advancing the cause of crime victims is immeasurable. Recognition of National Crime Victims' Week reflects just one of a number of accomplishments which also include national days of observance, creating the Office of  Victims of Crime, and establishing the Task Force on Victims of Crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, victims of crime are made to be victims a second time, this time as a result of our criminal justice system, the very system designed to protect them. In 2004, 20 years after Congress enacted the Victims of Crime Act which authorized the Victims Assistance Fund, Congress enacted the Justice for All Act. This was another important victory for crime victims, as it extended a number of enforceable rights to crime victims, including the right to reasonably be heard at any public proceeding  involving release, or plea or sentencing, the right to file a motion to reopen a plea, or a sentence in certain circumstances, and most importantly, the right to be treated with dignity and fairness and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the enactment of these rights is just one of a number of important changes that needs to occur to ensure that our Nation's criminal justice system is just for both offenders and for the victims of those crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continued recognition and support of National Crime Victims' Week serves many purposes, including to remind us of what victims have suffered, to thank those individuals and organizations who have selflessly dedicated themselves to assisting victims, and to urge us all to rededicate ourselves to continue President Reagan's vision and leadership in advancing the cause of victims of crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also want to note that for a number of years a number of us have worked very hard to pass a victims' right constitutional amendment. Now, we ought not to amend the Constitution unless it is absolutely necessary. And I think this is one incident in which it is necessary because the criminals, the defendants, their rights are contained within the Constitution itself. The right to a trial, for example. The right to have witnesses called on their behalf, the right not to have to self-incriminate  all are within the Constitution. However, the victims, not a word in the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are laws that have been passed, such as the law which gives a victim the right to be heard at a sentencing hearing or have family members heard at a sentencing hearing, but those are statutes. Oftentimes what happens is they come into conflict, and a judge will have to make a decision because they may be in conflict with each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The defendant has his or her rights within the Constitution. They are up here. The victim, their rights down here are statutory. And when it comes to deciding which one is going to prevail, the Constitution will trump that statute every time. Therefore, the crime, the one who committed the crime, the defendant, the criminal, their rights are held higher than the victims. That is just not right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Henry Hyde, when he was a Member of Congress, had introduced this some years ago, and about 5 years ago I took that up, took up the mantle for Henry to continue to push this way, and we have made progress. We have made progress in the law; but thus far, it is still not within the Constitution and it ought to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentlewoman and Mr. Scott also for pushing for this particular resolution this week. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to support all victims of crime all across the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers and urge passage of this important legislation. As  has been said by all of the other speakers, victims' rights is a very important issue and we don't want to forget those who have been victimized by crimes across the Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of National Crime Victims' Rights Week, an opportunity to reflect on the need for victims to be treated fairly, commemorate the progress we've made, and acknowledge the work that remains before us. This is a week in which we rededicate ourselves to the challenges that lie ahead in the fight for critical rights for victims of all crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently had the opportunity to meet Pat Byron, a woman from my home town of Louisville, Kentucky. Pat's daughter Mary was raped and beaten by her ex-boyfriend as a teenager. He was released from prison without Mary's knowledge, and tracked down the unsuspecting young woman in a parking lot; murdering her on her 21st birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the courage of Pat Byron and the leadership in Louisville, in 1994, the community pioneered VINE, Victim Information and Notification Everyday. VINE could have saved Mary's life, and for the last 13 years, it has saved many like her. This technology is now available in more than 2,000 communities in 41 states and guarantees a victim's right to notification and information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, one week after the most brutal shooting in American history I urge my colleagues to join me and my community in standing up for victims, not only by commemorating National Crime Victims' Rights Week, but in taking steps like automated crime victim notification to ensure that victims' rights are protected.</paragraph>
