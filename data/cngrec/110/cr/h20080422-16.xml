    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, oil has hit $118 a barrel. Gas is $3.50 to $4 a gallon. Fox News this morning said some experts say it will be $5 a gallon by later this summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most environmental radicals and extremists seem to come from very wealthy or very upper-income families. They want gas to go even higher so people will drive less. Perhaps the wealthy leaders of the Sierra Club and some of these other environmental groups aren't being hurt, but they are really hurting the poor and the lower income and the working people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need to produce all of our oil here domestically, but if we would just start producing a little bit more, then some of the OPEC countries and foreign energy producers would hold their prices down. We need to not let this country be sent into a deeper recession by environmental extremists and radicals.</paragraph>
