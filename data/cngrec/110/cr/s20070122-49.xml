    <paragraph>Mr. President, cloture has been filed today on the line-item veto offered by Senator Gregg. I filed a cloture motion on the underlying bill,  which is a straight minimum wage with no small business set-asides on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have had 4 amendments laid down, and there has been good debate. Tomorrow, we can have our party caucuses at 12:30. We may vote in the morning. There are four amendments pending. We have the Enzi amendment, and the HELP Committee majority is working with him to see if there can be a couple of changes made and, if so, we can vote on that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just say, with regard to the cloture motion just filed by the distinguished majority leader, that if cloture were to be invoked on the underlying bill, the opportunity to pass what has developed into a bipartisan minimum wage proposal, including both an increase in the minimum wage and tax provisions, which are important for the small businesses that tend to hire people who work at the minimum wage, would be lost. So certainly it is my hope that cloture  will not be invoked on Wednesday on the underlying bill so that we could continue in the bipartisan spirit in which we have begun this session of Congress and move forward on a bill that in all likelihood will receive, at the end of the process, a very large bipartisan vote of support, and that is a combination of the minimum wage increase and the small business tax provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I encourage my colleagues on this side of the aisle to, in the spirit of bipartisanship, defeat that so we can continue to deal with the substitute that I think will enjoy broad bipartisan support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, during the next couple of days, until we vote on the two cloture matters, if cloture is not invoked on the matter relating to Senator JUDD GREGG, then that matter, it is my understanding, would be withdrawn and we would go to cloture on the underlying bill. If that is, of course, passed, it would be just as Senator McConnell said--it would eliminate the matters the Finance Committee placed on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If it is not invoked, we are right back where we started from and would work off the substitute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope Senators would look at and offer whatever amendments they want on this matter. There is going to come a time, because we have so much other business to do and, besides, there is ample opportunity to file amendments on this bill, that I will be required to file cloture. It would be great if I didn't have to. We could agree on a finite list of amendments, dispose of those amendments, and move to final passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week sometime it is likely, as I explained to the distinguished Republican leader, we are going to have to go to the Iraq resolution or resolutions reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee. What the Republican leader and I have talked about doing--and we don't know if that is doable in the Senate--is to limit the votes that would be on that issue, whether we have a couple competing resolutions or one resolution. Whatever we do, we will try to work something out to the satisfaction  of the body.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, briefly, five amendments have been pending, three have been filed. I will have a better sense, I say to my friend, the majority leader, after lunch tomorrow how many amendments my side will be interested in filing. I certainly share the majority leader's view, provided cloture is not invoked on Wednesday, that we would work with the majority leader in the hopes of winding up this bill at the earliest possible time.</paragraph>
