    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we need to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program so children from low-income families without health insurance can get it. That is why my Republican colleagues and I remain supportive of a program and funding that will do just that. Unfortunately, the current SCHIP bill would send precious health care dollars to cover adults, illegal aliens, some children from families that are not low income, and others that have private insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans remain committed to putting children first. We want to provide the funds necessary to cover eligible children and enroll the low-income children still not covered. President Ronald Reagan foresaw this diversion of funds. He once said, "You know, we could say the Democrats spend their money like drunken sailors, but that would be unfair to drunken sailors. It would be unfair because the sailors are spending their own money."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
