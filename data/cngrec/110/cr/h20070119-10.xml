  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thank goodness that the 100-hour agenda is over. Maybe now we can get down to doing some real work on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The celebration by our friends on the other side of the aisle is for a victory of form over substance. In just 2 weeks, they have passed a watered-down 9/11 Commission recommendations package, killed working-class jobs by imposing an unfunded mandate upon small businesses, limited choice in health care by forcing the government to fix prices and decrease the availability of medicines for seniors, pulled a bait-and-switch by misrepresenting their promise to cut student loan interest rates while  offering no real relief to students; and finally, amazingly, fostered greater reliance on foreign oil by raising taxes on domestic oil production and exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people know the difference between campaign rhetoric and good policy, and they demand that the majority honor an open, honest and fair legislative process, one that produces positive, principled and bipartisan solutions. The American people expect no less and deserve more than has been delivered so far.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
