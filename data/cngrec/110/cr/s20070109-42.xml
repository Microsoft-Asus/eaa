    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I offered the bipartisan substitute amendment. Four amendments are pending as well. Today, I alerted Members to expect votes tomorrow. Also, I remind Members that all Members of the 110th Congress have been invited to the Supreme Court tomorrow. There is a dinner. There is no cocktail hour and no reception. The dinner will begin promptly at 6:30 tomorrow evening. I have been to these events over the years, and they are really good. We have to reach out to our separate  but equal branch of Government called the judicial branch. I find all nine of those Justices to be the most interesting people. They have such a tremendous responsibility. I think it will be good conversation, with a limited speech or two. I hope freshman Senators can find it in their schedules to come. It is also for the spouses.</paragraph>
