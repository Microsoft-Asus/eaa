  <speaking speaker="300019" topic="IN RECOGNITION OF DR. S.B. WOO">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge and commend the efforts of Dr. Shien Biau "S.B." Woo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Woo was born in 1937 in Shanghai, China. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong and the Communist Party took control and established the People's Republic of China. After living under communist rule for nearly 6 years, S.B. Woo and his parents came to the United States in 1955 to begin a new life in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>S.B. Woo took full advantage of this opportunity and earned bachelor of science degrees in mathematics and physics from Georgetown College in Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1963, S.B. married his wife, Katy, a gifted and accomplished person in her own right. The Woos have been married for nearly 44 years and they have two children, Chi I. and Chi Lan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>S.B. Woo continued his academic career by attaining his Ph.D. in physics from Washington University in St. Louis in 1964. Two years later, he joined the faculty at the University of Delaware, where he became a professor of physics and astronomy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Woo has authored numerous scholarly works in the cutting-edge field of physics, with such titles as "Role of Core Size in the Photoelectron Spectrum of Ions with Multiple Detachment Orbitals" and "Zero Core Contribution Calculation of Photodetachment Cross Sections and Photoelectron Spectra of Transition Metal Anions." Now, I'm not exactly sure what these texts are about, but I am sure that S.B. could not only explain them, but that he could explain them in such a way that we would all  understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, Dr. Woo retired from teaching, capping a nearly 36-year career at the University of Delaware. He is still rightfully considered by many to be one of the leading experts in the field of physics in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While his academic prowess is to be admired, Dr. Woo's greatest contribution has been his steadfast commitment to advancing the cause of Asian Americans in Delaware and across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Woo became the first Asian American to serve in statewide office in Delaware when he was elected lieutenant governor in 1984. With this victory, Dr. Woo became the highest ranking Chinese-American public office holder in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Woo's experience as an immigrant from China gave him a firsthand view of what it is like to come to a new land and begin to build a new life from scratch. While many people would have been satisfied with the success that Dr. Woo found in his chosen fields of physics and politics, he continues his work to improve the way of life for his fellow Asian Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has worked tirelessly to bring people into the political fold, working to increase voter turnout by reaching out to Asian Americans across the country and encouraging them to become active in the political process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, he also serves as a trustee of the University of Delaware; an Institute Fellow at the Institute of Politics, the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University; and as the National President of the Organization of Chinese Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I honor and commend my good friend Dr. S.B. Woo for his continued service to the State of Delaware and to Asian Americans across this great country. He is a remarkable yet humble man who has overcome many obstacles to reach the top of his chosen fields, and he continues to this day work to improve the lives of others. I consider it a privilege to know S.B. and Katy Woo and to be able to stand here today to speak on their behalf in the Senate.</paragraph>
