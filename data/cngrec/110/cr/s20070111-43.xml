  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend from Maine, Senator Collins, to submit a Resolution Marking January as National Stalking Awareness Month. I introduce today's measure because I want to renew our Nation's resolve to fight stalking and to promote public awareness about the newest stalking tool, technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine that you are a young wife--estranged from your husband. A court has ordered him to stay away from you, but he shows up everywhere you go. You see him while driving on the road, in the parking lot at work, at a nearby table in restaurants, and at your friends' homes. Although you haven't spoken to him in months, he always knows exactly where you are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the Seattle police received such a report from Sherri Peak, whose estranged husband seemed to know her every move. Detectives believed that Robert Peak was stalking his wife, and they brought Sherri's car into the city shop to scan for tracking devices. After several hours of futile searching, one officer popped off the dashboard cover and spotted a global positioning system (GPS) and a cell phone embedded in the car. Then police checked the victim's home computer and found spyware  that allowed her husband to hack into her e-mail. Sherri Peak was indeed being stalked--via technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peak case illustrates a disturbing criminal trend and the dark side of technology. The devices we use to surf the Internet, e-mail one another, download music, and find our way in unfamiliar towns have also equipped stalkers with powerful tools. While "conventional" stalkers follow a victim from home to work or place countless phone calls to their homes, technology-empowered stalkers use GPS to track victims and computer programs to trace every Web site victims visit and every e-mail they  send or receive. Stalkers can harass or threaten their victims (or urge others to do so) via e-mail or Web sites set up to harm the victim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The potential impact of these tactics is staggering. National statistics show that 1 in 12 women and 1 in 45 men will be stalked during their lifetime. The average duration of stalking is 2 years, and more often than not it is accompanied by physical violence. In one study, 3 of 4 women murdered by their intimate partners had been stalked by that partner before they were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although all 50 States and the Federal Government have stalking laws, many were drafted before the widespread use of e-mail, the Internet, chat rooms, Web sites, social networking sites, GPS, cell phones, and tiny hand- held video and digital cameras. Last year Congress tightened the Federal stalking law to take into account these potential stalking tools and techniques. Although some States are following suit, I urge state legislators to continually assess  the power of their stalking laws to prohibit and appropriately punish acts of stalking with current or even future technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>January is National Stalking Awareness Month--the perfect opportunity for parents, lawmakers and community leaders to carefully review State and local laws on stalking and insist that laws keep pace with technology and protect our families. Valuable information on stalking can be found at the Stalking Resource Center (www.ncvc.org/src). We are indebted to the Center's expertise and leadership on this issue. For immediate and confidential assistance, I also urge people to contact the National  Crime Victim Helpline at 1-800-FYI-CALL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I often watch my grandchildren learn with ever more speed to deftly manipulate technology, everything from making digital movies, downloading music, to surfing the Internet. It is clearly a brave, new world. And one that each of us should embrace, learn and celebrate. But with new rights, always come new responsibilities. Through vigilance, both citizens and officials can combat stalking via technology. Just as parents and teens are starting to learn how to protect their privacy while on-line,  we can all learn how to detect high-tech stalking and what to do if it occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before closing, I would like to thank Senator Collins for her commitment to this issue; it is always a pleasure to work with her.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Whereas an estimated 1,006,970 women and 370,990 men are stalked annually in the United States and, in the majority of such cases, the person is stalked by someone who is not a stranger;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 81 percent of women who are stalked by an intimate partner are also physically assaulted by that partner, and 76 percent of women who are killed by an intimate partner were also stalked by that intimate partner;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 26 percent of stalking victims lose time from work as a result of their victimization, and 7 percent never return to work;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic measures to protect themselves, such as relocating, changing their addresses, changing their identities, changing jobs, and obtaining protection orders;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas stalking is a crime that cuts across race, culture, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, and economic status;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the laws of all 50 States and the District of Columbia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas rapid advancements in technology have made cyber-surveillance the new frontier in stalking;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there are national organizations, local victim service organizations, prosecutors' offices, and police departments that stand ready to assist stalking victims and who are working diligently to craft competent, thorough, and innovative responses to stalking; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there is a need to enhance the criminal justice system's response to stalking, including through aggressive investigation and prosecution: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the Senate designates January 2007 as "National Stalking Awareness Month";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) National Stalking Awareness Month provides an opportunity to educate the people of the United States about stalking;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the people of the United States should applaud the efforts of the many victim service providers, such as police, prosecutors, national and community organizations, and private sector supporters, for their efforts in promoting awareness about stalking; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) policymakers, criminal justice officials, victim service and human service agencies, nonprofit organizations, and others should recognize the need to increase awareness of stalking and availability of services for stalking victims; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph> (3) the Senate urges national and community organizations, businesses, and the media to promote, through observation of National Stalking Awareness Month, awareness of the crime of stalking. &lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</paragraph>
