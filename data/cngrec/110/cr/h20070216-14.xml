    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, due to the funeral of a family member, I was unable to be present today for votes. I take my voting responsibility very seriously. Had I been present, I would have voted "yea" on final passage of <bill type="hc" number="63">H. Con. Res. 63</bill>, disapproving of the decision of the President announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq (Rollcall vote 99). Had I been present, I also would have voted "aye" on <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, to amend  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief for small businesses, and for other purposes (Rollcall vote 102).</paragraph>
