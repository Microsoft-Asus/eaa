    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 17th century poet John Donne speaks to death thusly: "Death be not proud," he says, "though some have called you mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so. And those thou thinkest thy doth overthrow die not, poor death. A short sleep past, we wake eternally and death shall be no more."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the confidence in her Christian faith with which our sister, Juanita Millender-McDonald, lived and with which she passed from this earth. This is what she meant when she told her family that she was going home. This is what we saw and at which we marveled as we observed her peace on display in the final hours that she worked amongst us, giving not a hint of distress or brokenheartedness or loss of confidence. Her grace and elegance in her final months and years when she knew well her  earthly fate is a lesson in how to live and how to leave this life for those of us who still live on this side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairwoman Juanita Millender-McDonald was serious about her work. I had the pleasure of finding this out firsthand when I was Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and Juanita was chair of the CBCF's annual legislative weekend. She helped to organize this event, which drew over 40,000 African American leaders to Washington, with great attention to detail, taxing all of us--sometimes we thought then too much--to meet our responsibilities and on time. But the result was a magnificent  event heralded by all of us as one of our very best. This House got only a glimpse of her profound organizational skills as she had the chance to serve us only a  short time in her post as Chair of the Committee on House Administration. It would have been wonderful for we who work here and for our Nation if we had been privileged to see more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it is now, we welcome our sister to her rest in the bosom of her Lord and we pray for comfort and peace for James, her husband, and their five children and grandchildren, and we thank her for her friendship and commitment to the House, to her constituents, and to her country. She served us proudly and well, and she will be well remembered.</paragraph>
