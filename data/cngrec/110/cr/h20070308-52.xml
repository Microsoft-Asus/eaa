    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3,188 servicemen and -women have died serving in Iraq, and 371 have given their lives fighting in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe these brave individuals and their families a debt of gratitude that can never fully be repaid. It is our responsibility to honor the ultimate sacrifice that our men and women in uniform have made while serving their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We often invoke their sacrifices in general, but seldom take the time to thank them individually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year I led a bipartisan group of Members of Congress in recognizing the individual members of our Armed Forces that have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan by reading the names and rank of each servicemember who had fallen in the line of duty so that they never will be forgotten and they will always be remembered in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far we have read just over 2,400 names on the floor of the people's House. Tonight and on future nights we will continue to complete this tribute with the names of our most recent fallen fellow Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I can, in the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt: "Each of these heroes stands in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live and grow and increase in its blessings."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless and keep each of the brave Americans whose memory we honor tonight:</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the distinguished Members who participated in this tribute and this honor, both those from last year and those who participated tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my colleagues to thank the brave men and women who continue to serve our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan and throughout the world and serve with distinction and honor. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families at this time until they come together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said this afternoon, in the words of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, "Each of these heroes stands in the unbroken line of patriots who dare to die that freedom might live and grow and increase in its blessings."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of our colleagues have stumbled over the names; I hope those families understand that. Although we struggle with the names, we honor their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to place the names and pictures of those who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan outside  my office in the Longworth Building. These faces and these names and their rank serve as a stark reminder to me and those who pass by my office that there are young men and women who have given their lives for our country, and we need to stop and remember their sacrifices and the sacrifices of their family, to thank them and honor them. May  we always remember them, their names and their faces. God bless them, and God bless America.</paragraph>
