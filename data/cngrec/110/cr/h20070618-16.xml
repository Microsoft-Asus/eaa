    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Arizona Women's Softball Team on their eighth national championship. The Wildcats won their title June 6, 2007, giving them back-to-back championships over the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The road to the championship was not easy for the Wildcats. The Wildcats climbed out of the loser's bracket turning the tournament to face off in the best of three championship series against the Lady Volunteers of Tennessee. After losing the opener of the series, the Wildcats won the second game 1-0. The final game of the series was the most-viewed women's college game on television and was played in front of a sold-out audience. The game was 0-0 until the fifth inning, when the Wildcats scored  five runs. Ms. Mowatt, the pitcher, continued to pitch a no-hitter, leading the Wildcats to their second title in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those of us that are alumni and have the pleasure of living in the community where the Wildcats Women's Softball Team has brought us great honor and prestige, know that the effort and the victories are due to great team effort. It's about teamwork, but there are individuals that must be acknowledged, and it begins with the head coach, Coach Candrea, who has taken the team to every one of their championship titles, in addition to leading the United States team to a Gold Medal in the 2004 Olympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Acknowledgment has to be extended to the pitcher, Ms. Mowatt, who threw 1,035 pitches in eight games in 7 days, setting a new women's college record for pitching 60 innings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The members of the team that were selected to the all-tournament team due to their performance were the shortstop, Ms. Fox; third basewoman, Ms. Leles; and second basewoman, Ms. Lowe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the team and support staff, I would like to recognize the endless support of family, friends and fans who give to the university and support the university throughout the whole season. The victory for U of A Wildcats Women's Softball Team is celebrated throughout my district and by Wildcat alumni across the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think their victory is more than a championship title. It is a testament of the ability of women and the need and the importance of the continued investment in title IX. The victory  reminds us of that importance every time that a women's team at a collegiate level is as successful as the University of Arizona Wildcats and other teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My congratulations to the University of Arizona Women's Softball Team for their great victory, for the honor that they bring the State, and for the honor that they bring women athletics across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 475, congratulating the University of Arizona Women's Softball Team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division Women's College World Series Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 6 of this year, the University of Arizona Wildcats Women's Softball Team defeated a very strong and successful University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers Team by a score of 5-0 to win the three-game series 2-1 and capture the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Women's Softball Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is Arizona's second consecutive title. Much of the team's success is due to its coach, Mike Candrea. Over the last 21 seasons, he has compiled a record of 1,131 victories, only 228 defeats and two ties; however, you have a tie in the softball game. He has won 18 Coach of the Year awards and is an inductee in the National Fastpitch Coaches Association Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his career as a Wildcat coach, he has taken the team to the College World Series 19 times and has won eight College World Series titles. During the 2007 season, the Wildcats compiled an impressive record of 50 wins, 14 losses and only 1 tie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The junior, Taryne Mowatt, the 2007 World Series MVP, set a record for the most pitches thrown in the College World Series by throwing 1,000 pitches in a week, pitching every inning of the tournament for the Wildcats. This season she compiled a record of 42 wins and 12 losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Arizona should be recognized as an outstanding academic institution as well. Now in its second century of service to the State, the University of Arizona has become one of the Nation's top 20 public research institutions. It is one of only 62 members in the Association of American Universities, a prestigious organization that recognizes universities with exceptionally strong research and academic programs. With a world-class faculty in fields as diverse as astronomy, plant science,  biomedical science, business, law, music and dance, the University of Arizona offers a rewarding educational experience to all of its students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to the University's president, Robert Shelton, the athletic director, Jim Livengood, head coach Mike Candrea and his staff, all of the hardworking players, the fans and to the University of Arizona. I am happy to join my friend and colleague, Representative Grijalva, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't have any other speakers on the subject. And I would like to acknowledge the comments, and I'm very appreciative of the comments of Mr. Bishop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I won't take much time. I'll be very brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to come over here and congratulate my colleague, Congressman Grijalva, and especially congratulate his women's softball team from the University of Arizona. They proved, once again, as they have done several times before, that they really have another great team. I think this was probably, what, their seventh national championship or something like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was the first time that my Lady Vols softball team had gone as far as that team did. The University of Tennessee is my alma matter. It's a school of which I am very proud; and it has not only great academics, but it also has a very rich athletic heritage and history. We've been primarily known for our men's football team and our women's basketball, several national championships by both of those programs. But the Lady Vols softball team this year was one of the greatest sports teams in the  history of the University of Tennessee. And, in fact, our great pitcher, Monica Abbott, won more games than any pitcher in women's collegiate softball history. And probably no athlete in the history of the University of Tennessee has ever dominated a sport like Monica Abbott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So once again I want to say congratulations to my Lady Vols, my Tennessee Lady Vols softball team. But I'm here today to especially offer congratulations to a great women's softball team from the University of Arizona. They won another national championship, and it was a well-deserved championship because they had to fight very hard to get it, and I just wanted to come and say congratulations at this time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), and just indicate to him that both teams presented themselves, not only athletically, but as fine sportsmanship, fine athletes and fine universities. And I appreciate his comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution may deal with the University of Arizona Wildcats, but it obviously honors all people, all ladies who were involved in softball athletics this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="475">H. Res. 475</bill>.</chair>
