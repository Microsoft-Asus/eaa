    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3106">H.R. 3106</bill>. This names a postal facility in Ferdinand, Indiana after David L. Nord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3106">H.R. 3106</bill>, introduced by Representative Baron Hill on July 19, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on August 1, 2007, by voice vote. This measure, cosponsored by eight Members, has the support of the entire Indiana congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Staff Sergeant David Nord was killed on June 23, 1969, in Bing Long, South Vietnam. He was assigned to 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Camp Blackhorse, Vietnam as a scout section leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Nord was awarded the Bronze Star, along with several other awards for his bravery and sacrifice to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Baron Hill, for introducing this legislation, and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon, again, to pay tribute to another remarkable soldier and another true American hero. At the age of only 21, Staff Sergeant David Nord from Ferdinand, Indiana became a genuine war hero. On June 23, 1969, he was killed in Vietnam War action while serving with the U.S. Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Nord was born and raised in Ferdinand, Indiana, sharing his younger years with his one brother and three sisters. After graduating in 1967 from St. Ferdinand High School, he worked in the Ferdinand furniture factory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Nord was drafted into the Army where he was assigned to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Camp Blackhorse, Vietnam. With his positive attitude and hard work he rose quickly through the ranks and served as a scout section leader. After serving several months, Staff Sergeant Nord was granted a 21-day home leave, and it was during that time that he married Louann, his long-time girlfriend. Sadly, only three weeks after returning to the battlefield, he and most of his  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H10105]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is for those reasons that we name this post office for Staff Sergeant David Nord in his hometown of Ferdinand, Indiana. And, Madam Speaker, I hope that all of our colleagues will vote for this unanimously.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3106">H.R. 3106</bill> would rename the post office in Ferdinand, Indiana after David Nord, the only Vietnam veteran from Ferdinand who was killed in action in the Vietnam War. This idea first came to my attention because of the hard work of David's family and his friends. They called me. This bill represents what we, as Members of our Congress, are here for, and that is to represent our constituents back home. I'd like to thank and recognize a few people who have been influential  in getting this accomplished. First I would like to recognize David Nord's brother Dan and the rest of the family David left behind, including his son, David Nord II. Dan has been very active in making sure his brother's life is remembered and honored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like Dan, Frank Begle, a fellow soldier of David Nord's in Vietnam, has been a driving force in getting the Ferdinand post office renamed to honor David Nord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also Kathy Tretter, the editor and co-publisher of the local paper in Ferdinand, population of about 800 or 900 people. The Ferdinand News contacted my staff about this effort after working on stories about David's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Indiana delegation for all cosponsoring this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take a moment to touch on why the post office in downtown Ferdinand should be renamed to honor David Nord. David Nord is the only Ferdinand native who was killed in Vietnam. He was drafted into the Army, and in talking to his younger brother Dan, David was not very excited about having to go to Vietnam. But he did his duty to his country, and for that we give him thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David rose quickly through the Army ranks because of his hard work and skill. And when he returned home briefly in 1969, he came home to marry his long-time girlfriend. Unfortunately, and tragically, shortly thereafter, David returned to Vietnam and was killed on Monday, June 23, 1969, when a tank he was commanding had to stop because the rubber tracker which propelled the vehicle forward slipped from its drive wheels and David was hit by a grenade. He died instantly, as well as most of his crew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David's son was born just a few months after his death, and David, I know right now, is trying to get to a television screen to see his father being honored here this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A friend from Ferdinand who was stationed in the same unit as David tells stories about how David used to give starving Vietnamese women and children his Army rations. That was the kind of guy that he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David left behind his parents, his wife, his younger brother and a son he never met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant David Nord was honored with the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Vietnamese Campaign Good Conduct Ribbon, Combat Infantry Badge, National Defense Service Ribbon, Vietnam Service Medal, Expert Badge with Rifle Bar, and Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His family still lives in Ferdinand, Indiana, as well as his son David Nord, Jr. Clearly, David deserves this recognition, and it's an honor for me to introduce this resolution. And I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important bill for David Nord and his family and for the city and town of Ferdinand, Indiana.</paragraph>
