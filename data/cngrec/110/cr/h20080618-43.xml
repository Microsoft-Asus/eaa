  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Explosives remain the preferred weapon of choice for terrorists the world over. Explosives have been used against this Nation abroad and on American soil. Because explosives, be they military grade or homemade, improvised explosive devices are easy to obtain and use, the explosives threat needs a focused, coordinated approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attack, a great deal of attention was paid to the emerging threats, such as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, needed focus on the explosives threat has been lacking, despite the issuance of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 19, Combating Terrorist Use of Explosives in the United States, in February 2007. <bill type="h" number="4749">H.R. 4749</bill>, the National Bombing Prevention Act of 2008, will help fill this gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that the gentleman from Long Island (Mr. King) and I introduced was considered in committee in May. It was improved at full committee markup with the addition of some key amendments and reported unanimously by our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a straightforward bipartisan bill. It establishes the Office of Bombing Prevention within the Office of Infrastructure Protection at the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with other bills we have brought to the floor today, I strongly believe that this bill fits well with the priorities found in <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the DHS authorization bill that is pending before the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Bombing Prevention, in fact, already exists in the Department. This bill simply authorizes it and sets forth its responsibilities in law. The bill authorizes $10 million for FY 2009, a little over the administration's budget request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the bill authorizes $25 million annually. Then, for each subsequent fiscal year, such sums as may be necessary are provided. The Office is responsible for coordinating the government efforts to deter, detect, prevent, protect against and respond to terrorist explosive attacks in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To do so, the Office is required to conduct analysis of the Federal, State, local and tribal government capabilities and maintain a national database on the capabilities of bomb squads, explosive detection, canine teams, tactic teams and public safety dive teams around the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and periodically update a national strategy to prevent and prepare for terrorist explosive attacks in the United States. A national strategy is also required under HSPD 19.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4749">H.R. 4749</bill> also authorizes the Office to support efforts, as well as research, into explosives detection and mitigation. An informed public is a prepared public. In this spirit, the bill directs the Office to develop and implement a public awareness campaign that can reach the private sector as well as ordinary citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill ensures that we understand and enhance bomb detection through the proper training and use of canine detection units. For all these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, before I begin I would ask that the Record include a letter from the National Tactical Officers Association to Congressman King and Congressman Rogers in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OFFICERS ASSOCIATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Doylestown, PA, January 27, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN KING AND CONGRESSMAN ROGERS: The National Tactical Officers Association strongly supports Congressman King's Bill (<bill type="h" number="4749">HR4749</bill>) amending the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the Office for Bombing Prevention and addressing terrorist explosive threats. We also continue to support Senator Collins' and Senator Lieberman's Bill (<bill type="s" number="2292">S2292</bill>) to increase funding for the Department of Homeland Security Office for Bombing Prevention. Both amendments provide important resources  against the use of terrorist improvised Explosive Devices, including coordination of national and intergovernmental bombing prevention activities, requirements, capabilities, gap analysis and information sharing and awareness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security Office for Bombing Prevention coordinates national and intergovernmental bombing prevention activities in our national bombing prevention posture and runs information sharing and awareness programs for State and local governments, law enforcement, first responders, the private sector and the public. As recently demonstrated in Glasgow, London and in daily news reports from Iraq and Afghanistan, terrorist use of IEDs is a primary threat. We commend you for your  support and your leadership in focusing the attention of the House and the nation on this serious issue and on the role of the Department of Homeland Security Office for Bombing Prevention in leading national efforts to prevent the use of explosives by terrorists in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NTOA is the professional association for law enforcement personnel, sworn correctional officers, tactical emergency medical personnel, military police and special operations personnel who specialize in the resolution of critical incidents. Since 1983, NTOA has worked to provide professional education, training and research for law enforcement personnel engaged in tactical missions and currently has over 30,000 members representing over 1,600 police agencies. NTOA has worked with the Department  of Homeland Security Office for Bombing Prevention to integrate SWAT and bomb squad personnel and capabilities to protect soft targets against threats for an armed adversary using explosive devices, as seen in the 2004 Beslan School attack in Russia. OBP provides an invaluable resource to State and local law enforcement through the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security's Office for Bombing Prevention has been an exemplary partner for its State and local stakeholders in the bombing prevention and law enforcement communities. The National Tactical Officers Association applauds Senator Collins, Senator Lieberman, Representative Rogers and yourself for your support for the bombing prevention community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Gnagey,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the ranking member of Homeland Security, PETER KING of New York, introduced this bill to authorize the Office of Bombing Prevention within the Department of Homeland Security. He would obviously be here were he not attending the family funeral for Tim Russert, and I am here in his stead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Bombing Prevention provides the necessary analysis and coordination of our Nation's bomb prevention capability to best protect our citizens from the threat posed by explosive materials. We only need to look at terrorist activities overseas to understand that conventional and improvised explosive devices, IEDs, are a terrorist's weapon of choice against military and civilian targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within the United States, we have been subject to our own share of explosive attacks, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, among others. State and local authorities have developed the capabilities to respond to potential explosive threats and to neutralize them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, these are among the bravest men and women that we have as our first responders. Yet without the office established in this bill, there would be no analysis of our nationwide capability to respond to explosive threats, or where gaps exist in training, equipment and personnel against a national baseline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This analysis will assist State and local officials in applying for Homeland Security grants to fill these gaps. As has been mentioned many times on this floor, there has been a bipartisan effort through our committee to ensure that we take a risk-based approach to the terrorist threat. It makes the most sense. It is one that both sides of the aisle have been committed to, and this enables that even further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this legislation will authorize the Office to continue to promote information sharing and IED security awareness through advanced bomb prevention techniques and usable information. The Office uses a secure Web site known as TRIPwire to provide to bomb prevention officials across the country access to current terrorist IED tactics, techniques and procedures, along with expert analysis and reports, making it a one-stop shop for actionable information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, our troops have had extensive experience with IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan. This legislation instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to work closely with the Department of Defense to take advantage of what our troops have learned on the battlefield, both in tactics and technology, to improve the capability of our first responders here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preventing a bomb from going off should involve more than just those first responders attempting to neutralize the threat once the bomb has been placed. Education and awareness programs regarding the threat of IEDs are also included in this legislation to ensure information on explosive precursors is provided to merchants so that they can recognize suspicious purchases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this legislation includes an amendment from our committee colleague, MIKE ROGERS of Alabama, to improve the canine explosive detection teams in use around the country. These canine teams are invaluable resources to detect and deter IED attacks before they occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that this office is not designed to replace existing elements of counter-explosive expertise already found in the Federal Government, but, rather, to assist in coordinating State, local and tribal capability. In fact, as I said, the National Tactical Officers Association supports this legislation in the letter that has been entered into the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for this Office of Bombing Prevention is clear. Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of <bill type="h" number="4749">H.R. 4749</bill>.</paragraph>

They can be exceedingly proud of the bipartisanship that is being displayed between the current chairman and the former chairman, both of whom have worked tirelessly to bring this piece of legislation to fruition, so I think that today, the people of Mississippi and the people of New York should span the chasm and understand that bipartisanship is alive and well because of representatives that they have sent  to the Congress of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to support and encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It does establish an Office of Bombing Prevention, and if the truth be told, whatever amount of money we spend on this legislation will be money well spent, money well spent. Protecting the American people from persons who would perform dastardly deeds is an absolute necessity of the government of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to say that the ranking member, without objection, and the chairman allowed a piece of legislation, this piece of legislation, to be amended so that we could have a public awareness campaign so that the public could be a part of protecting itself. If the public is aware of the methodologies that are being utilized by those who would perform insidious acts, the public can help us to defend ourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation requires this public awareness campaign. It will reach small businesses, it will reach the very large businesses. It also will, in an effort to reach all, make sure people are  reached who are physically challenged, those who are mentally challenged, those who may have some language deficiencies. In fact, in my district the ballot is printed in English, Spanish and Vietnamese. We must make sure that all persons have an opportunity to  receive the education and the information that this bill requires that we impart to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the two outstanding representatives on this committee, the chairperson and the former chairperson, I want to salute you, and I want to thank you for allowing the amendment to go forward, such that it is now a part of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would simply say, as the chairman pointed out, a well-informed public is a well-protected public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I salute you and I thank you. Mr. Ranking Member, I salute you and thank you as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I support this National Bombing Prevention Act for 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman who just spoke from the State of Texas has said, this is a rather inclusive bill. It has a component of operations and training in it; also a component of awareness. And together, they combine to make an excellent bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="4749">H.R. 4749</bill> is important legislation that will ensure that we are positioned to address explosive threats at all levels of government. We know that explosives are all too often terrorists' weapons of choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under HSPD-19, DHS is tasked with researching, identifying, and communicating "lessons learned and best practices, concerning the use of explosives as a terrorist weapon" to enhance "the preparedness of Federal, State, local, territorial, and tribal government personnel to deter, prevent, detect, protect against, and respond to explosive attacks in the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of <bill type="h" number="4749">H.R. 4749</bill> will put us on a path to enhance the Nation's terrorism response capability and ensure that first responders and first preventers have what they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge a "yes" vote on this important homeland security measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="NATIONAL TACTICAL">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="4749">H.R. 4749</bill>, the National Bombing Prevention Act, introduced by my distinguished colleague from New York, Representative KING This important legislation establishes the Office of Bombing Prevention within the Protective Security Coordination Division of the Office of Infrastructure Protection of the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a bipartisan bill, whose lead sponsor is the Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Representative KING, and is also cosponsored by Chairman THOMPSON. The function of the Office of Bombing Prevention already exists in the Department, and this bill establishes it in statute. The Office is responsible for coordinating the Government efforts to deter, detect, prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist explosive attacks in the United States.  As we all know, the most likely terrorist threat to our Nation's critical infrastructure and transportation modes is from explosives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we need to ensure that the Office of Bombing Prevention has the protection of being established by the force of law, so the Department can more readily meet the threats to our Nation. This legislation requires the Secretary to develop and periodically update a national strategy to prevent and prepare for terrorist explosive attacks in the United States due 90 days after the date of enactment. The Secretary is further required to report to Congress regarding the national strategy.  This strategy is also called for by Homeland Security Presidential Directive-19, Combating Terrorist Use of Explosives in the United States, issued by the President in February of 2007. This legislation also authorizes the Office to support technology transfer efforts as well as research into explosives detection and mitigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did, however, have one reservation with regards to this legislation, regarding canine procurement, which is why I introduced an amendment, which was accepted by the full Committee, to address that issue. Dogs are used to detect illicit and illegal substances every day. They are used to: detect illegal narcotics; find money that is being smuggled out of the country; and locate explosives that may be concealed in cargo, within vehicles, on aircraft, in luggage and on passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that every day, the actions of these dogs and their handlers significantly contribute toward deterring threats and protecting our Nation from terrorists. While the contributions of our canine forces are priceless, they are not without cost. We must place a price on what we are willing to pay for untrained dogs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General has found that from April 2006 through June 2007, Customs and Border Protection spent $1.46 million on purchasing 322 untrained dogs--that is about $4500 per dog. Most of these dogs are purchased in Europe and brought to America. These are not fully trained animals. They are puppies that will be trained to provide valuable service. I think most people would find $4500 for an untrained dog an exorbitant amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I cannot deem this amount out of bounds because the Department of Defense pays $3500 for each untrained dog. The Secret Service pays an average of $4500 for each untrained dog. Therefore, the price paid by CBP is within the acceptable range of current practice. However, I think that if we are to be good stewards of the American tax dollar, we must change the current practice. When one considers that domestic breeders offer the same kinds of dogs for $500-$2000, we cannot justify what  I can only call a puppy tariff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would require the Secretary to explore ways to reduce the amount we pay for each dog we purchase by considering the use of different breeds, procuring dogs from domestic breeders and seeking out dogs from animal shelters or rescue groups. If this Department can successfully implement a new method to obtain capable dogs for our homeland security needs, we could begin a trend that would save the American people millions of dollars each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the inclusion of my amendment, I am deeply satisfied with this legislation. I am proud to support this legislation, which brings our great Nation closer to its goal of securing the homeland, and I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
