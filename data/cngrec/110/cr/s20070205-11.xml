    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we need to find a way to ensure that fair penalties are assessed by administrative law judges and the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission within the appeals process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to review and ask questions about the structure of mine rescue teams and the changes codified by the MINER Act last year. Here is  another area where the rules issued by MSHA in recent years have contradicted the intent and spirit of the 1977 Mine Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to probe whether enough has been done. Two deaths last month in southern West Virginia serve as a macabre reminder that the crisis in the coal fields is not yet over--will probably never be over--but we have got to work at it. It is not yet over. We must be innovative. It is time for us to stop simply addressing mine disasters as they happen. We must seek opportunities to get ahead of the dangers. We must use foresight as well as hindsight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, I met with the Assistant Secretary of Labor, Mine Safety and Health, Richard Stickler. Mr. Stickler is in his current position because of a recess appointment in October 2006. He has not been confirmed by the Senate, and so his appointment will expire at the end of this year. I am hopeful that he will prove himself a friend of the coal miner. He has a dedicated team at MSHA, which includes many former coal miners who would like to see MSHA do better. I am convinced that more can be  done. The question is whether the Department of Labor and the White House will let MSHA do what needs to be done. The Congress will get some insight into that question as it reviews the President's budget request for mine safety, which was delivered today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and as a Senator who will have some say about the Federal budget for mine safety, hear me when I say that the days of cheating the safety and well-being of our Nation's coal miners are over. The Senate Appropriations Committee will examine the various mine safety accounts, and the Senate Appropriations Committee will make its recommendations to the Senate about where improvements can be made. That process has already begun with the inclusion  of $13 million above--above, on top of, over--the President's request in the continuing resolution for the fiscal year 2007 for MSHA to hire and train additional coal safety inspectors. I and other Senators have encouraged the President of the United States--hear me--to include additional funds to retain those inspectors in his mine safety budget request for the fiscal year 2008, and I am glad that the President appears to have done so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue that is close to my heart, and I pledge to do all that I can to increase congressional oversight in the coal field. As a son of the coal fields, the Appalachian coal fields, as the son of a coal miner, I am determined, yes, determined to be the "captain of a mighty host demanding the rights to which free men"--free men--coal miners--"free men are entitled." And women. Free men and women are entitled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, that concludes my prepared speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say this to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I have been privileged to be here but a small fraction of the time that he has, 29 years here and well over 40 for my colleague from West Virginia, but in that period we have worked many times on behalf of coal miners.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>As the Presiding Officer recognized, my fellow colleague from Virginia, our States are joined.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Those mines have a great deal of comparability, those in Virginia and those in West Virginia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Joined at the hip.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>They are joined. The plight of the miners and their families has been a subject that no Senator in the modern history of this Senate has fought harder for than the senior senator from West Virginia, and very often you have involved me and my colleagues, whoever they might be. I have served with three now, the distinguished Harry Byrd, Jr., whom you will recall, Senator Robb, and Senator Allen. All of us have worked on this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope to join you on this, and I hope the Presiding Officer, likewise, will work on this subject of coal mine safety. So I thank my friend.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished, the very distinguished senior senator from the great State of Virginia. I thank him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and we will work together.</paragraph>
