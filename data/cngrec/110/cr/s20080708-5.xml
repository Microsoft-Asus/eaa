  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6371">S6371</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the leader remarks, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an hour, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each during that morning hour. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the FISA legislation. We will offer and debate amendments to the bill today and begin voting sometime tomorrow morning. When we come in tomorrow morning, there will be 105 minutes left of debate time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As previously announced, to accommodate Senators wanting to attend the funeral of Jesse Helms, there will be no votes today. We do that to honor our departed friend Jesse Helms. So there will be no votes today. That will work out just fine. It is appropriate that we do that and have no votes today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will be in recess from 12:30 to 2:15 today to allow our weekly Democratic caucus luncheon. Republicans, who normally have theirs the same time we do, will have theirs tomorrow. I have indicated to the Republican leader that we will protect his caucus. There will be no votes tomorrow during that period of time. Having said that, we are going to do everything we can to complete all the votes before the Republican caucus tomorrow. If we do not finish, we may have a vote after lunch. We will do  that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Around 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, we are going to have another vote on the Medicare doctors fix, which is so important to our country. We hope by 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon we will pick up another vote, that we will have the 60 votes. That certainly would be good news for senior citizens, all those people on Medicare, and the doctors who want to take care of those patients.</paragraph>
