  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="TITLE IV--CHILD SOLDIERS PREVENTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Public Law 106-386, has made, I believe, an enormous positive difference in our efforts to end modern-day slavery, a nefarious enterprise that nets the exploiters billions of dollars each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 7-year-old landmark law and its numerous reinforcing provisions to prevent trafficking, to protect victims and to prosecute to the max those who traffic, has been a model statute worldwide. Indeed, many of its provisions have been adopted into law in whole or in part by governments around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the TVPA of 2000 does not pull any punches. By naming the names of countries out of compliance with what we call minimum standards and by imposing smart sanctions that are prescribed in the act, the withholding of nonhumanitarian aid, for example, we have signaled to the world that ending this egregious practice is among the highest priorities of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By protecting the victims and not sending them back to their home country where they are often exploited in a vicious cycle of exploitation, we say to the victims we will make every effort to make you safe and secure. By prosecuting the traffickers and imposing serious jail time, we are telling these exploiters we are coming after you, we will hunt you down, and you are going to pay for your crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the enactment of the TVPA, the traffickers here and abroad are increasingly likely to face prosecution and conviction. In the 7-year period before its enactment, DOJ prosecuted 91 suspected traffickers. In the last 7 years, the Justice Department has prosecuted 449, representing a 339 percent increase. The Department has secured 342 convictions and guilty pleas, compared with 74 in the same period prior to the act. And it has opened 822 new investigations, an almost five-fold increase over  the 135 opened prior to implementation of the law. Worldwide, nearly 5,700 traffickers were prosecuted last year alone, and more than 3,400 were convicted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notwithstanding these successes, it is clear that more has to be done to destroy this mob-infested, criminal enterprise known as human trafficking. According to research sponsored by the U.S. Government and completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked internationally and millions more are trafficked within their country. According to the same research, the vast majority of transnational victims, almost 80 percent, are women and girls, and almost half of those 800,000 victims  are minors. These figures are low compared to those posited by the International Labor Organization, which estimates 12.3 million people are subjected to forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, and sexual servitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The continued imperative to fight modern-day slavery was again brought home to me while I was in Russia last week. At the same time as I was participating in meetings with Russian officials about how to improve our respective countries' efforts to fight human trafficking, the news media was reporting that a man who was living in my home state of New Jersey--just outside my district--had been accused of engaging in sex trafficking. This individual with dual U.S-Russian citizenship allegedly was  traveling to St. Petersburg and hiring out 13- and 14-year old girls from an orphanage as prostitutes after he himself had sexually abused them. This case highlights the fact that we all potentially have traffickers living in our neighborhoods, and we must do more to protect our children and children everywhere in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, is a very good piece of bipartisan legislation, and it aims to do just that by updating, expanding, and improving the TPVA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been lessons learned since the first law was enacted 8 years ago and subsequently reauthorized in 2003 and 2005. They are incorporated into this legislation as we try to do an even better job in mitigating the suffering of the victims while simultaneously going after those who traffic and the countries that harbor traffickers who are also part of the problem themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is appropriately named after William Wilberforce, who was 21 years old when he was elected to the House of Commons in 1780. John Newton, the former slave captain turned convert to Christ, encouraged Wilberforce as well as others to fight the battle against slavery. Wilberforce agreed and then poured his heart into that battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wilberforce once said: "Never, never will we desist until we extinguish every trace of this bloody traffic to which our posterity, looking back to the history of those enlightened times, will scarce believe that it has been suffered to exist so long to disgrace and dishonor this country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also said: "So enormous, so dreadful, so remediable did the trade's wickedness quickly appear that my own mind was completely made up for its abolition." We need to fight with Wilberforce-like tenacity against this modern-day slave trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most prominent provisions of the original TVPA was the establishment of the tier-ranking system that indicates how well or poorly a country is conforming to the minimum standards. We found when we created the watch list that some of the countries began to realize they could be "parked" there with no serious consequence for their failure. Tier 2 watch list countries found there was no penalty even though they made no improvements. That has to change: Two years and then you are off  the watch list, up or down. If significant improvements fail to materialize, or the country fails to come up with a written plan to eliminate trafficking and devote sufficient resources to implement that plan, the country is put on tier three, subject to penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the William Wilberforce Act would also clarify a provision in the original TVPA--that should never have required clarification--that the Secretary of Health and Human Services must make initial determinations of benefit eligibility for minors who are potential trafficking victims, without the involvement of either the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security. This should rectify an erroneous interpretation and application of the law by these agencies, and facilitate the  immediate assistance desperately needed by children rescued from exploitative and traumatic situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the many other important provisions of this bill, calls for investigations by the Inspector Generals of the Department of Defense, State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, respectively, into ascertain contracts awarded by those agencies. The IGs' attention would be directed to contracts that carry a risk of encouraging human trafficking, including instances where a contractor or subcontractor may be engaging in the procurement of a commercial sex act.  The reports to be submitted to Congress subsequent to these investigations will be valuable in ascertaining the commitment of our own government in combating human trafficking, and provide an example to be emulated by other governments as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would emphasize that effective cooperation, and especially the bipartisan cooperation we see here today, and partnership with other countries, is essential if we are to win this winnable war. Without it, we are doomed to either meager results or outright failure. With so many lives hanging in the balance, failure simply is not an option. None of us alone can stop human trafficking. Too much evil is involved here, and the prospect of making billions has enticed some of  the most unsavory and cruel individuals on Earth, including organized crime. Too much demand, enabled by crass indifference, unbridled hedonism and misogynistic attitudes has turned people, especially women, into objects, only valued for their utility in the brothel or in the sweatshop. And the relative lack of visibility  makes the task of combating trafficking all the more difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trafficking, like germs, infection and disease, thrives in shadowy and murky places. But the contagion slows and it even dies when exposed to the light. This legislation brings more light, bright light, to this problem; and it will act as a powerful disinfectant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the challenge to us today is to bring this new light, the bright light of sustained scrutiny and enacting good laws, like this one, and then implementing them aggressively. We need to employ best practices and well-honed strategies in order to win the freedom of the slaves and to spare others unspeakable agony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, we can make the pimps and the exploiters pay by doing serious jail time as well as the forfeiture of their assets, their boats, their villas, and their fat bank accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can end this barbaric, cruel modern-day slavery. Make no mistake about it, this is a winnable war but we need to fight in a way so as to win. This legislation further propels us in that fight, and we will win this and the slaves will be free.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="7311">H.R. 7311</bill>, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 and applaud its passage in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Act will allow for appropriations through 2011 to assist in combating human trafficking and to further provide protection for victims of human sex trafficking in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Chairwoman of the Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime and Counterterrorism, I held a series of hearings entitled "Crossing the Border: Immigrants in Detention and Victims of Trafficking." These hearings identified and discussed many urgent issues related to the prevention of human trafficking and assistance for victims of human trafficking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These issues impact countries around the world, whether they are a source of or destination for trafficked persons. Official estimates show that between 2 to 4 million persons are trafficked each year, including approximately 17,500 individuals who are trafficked into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States must also work to improve its efforts to combat trafficking within our own borders. This bill will assist with enhancing the rights of victims, who are trafficked into the United States, and will provide special protections to child victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we must continue to work on this issue in our local communities. In my district, a number of agencies, including law enforcement, service providers, and community organizations have joined together to form the Orange County Human Trafficking, Task Force (OCHTTF). I am very proud of the Task Force's work to reduce human trafficking in southern California, and I urge my colleagues to support these types of task forces as communities around the country work to stop human trafficking</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="7311">H.R. 7311</bill> also provides critical assistance to victims seeking relief and access to special U.S. visas to protect them from their traffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support this legislation which is an important step in the worldwide fight against human trafficking.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="TITLE IV--CHILD SOLDIERS PREVENTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I, in concert with Mr. Conyers, the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, make the following explanatory statement regarding <bill type="h" number="7311">H.R. 7311</bill>, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="7311">H.R. 7311</bill>, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008, reauthorizes existing U.S. programs to combat human trafficking and establishes new requirements and programs regarding trafficking into both sexual exploitation and forced labor. Among a wide range of initiatives, the bill establishes new programs to prevent trafficking from occurring in foreign countries where trafficking begins, widens U.S. assistance programs to U.S. citizens, and provides additional protections  for trafficking survivors who are threatened by trafficking perpetrators, and for children who are at risk of being repatriated into the hands of traffickers or abusers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wilberforce Act also improves upon existing criminal prohibitions against human traffickers, including streamlining in the Slavery/Trafficking chapter of the federal criminal code, and creating new criminal tools to reach unscrupulous labor recruiters. Unlike previous reauthorizations, this reauthorization is for four years, from fiscal years 2008 to 2011, recognizing that U.S. anti-trafficking programs have become more established. The bill reflects an effort to develop a consensus between  <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, passed by the House on December 4, 2007, and <bill type="s" number="3061">S. 3061</bill>, ordered reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 8, 2008. The legislation draws from the common approaches in both bills and develops alternative proposals where the two bills diverge. This explanatory statement draws attention</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title I</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title I of the bill draws from substantially similar positions in both the House and the Senate bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 102 provides more targeted amendments to section 105 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 with essentially the same objectives of requiring the establishment of the Office, promoting public-private partnerships to end trafficking and clarifying the role of the Director of the Office with regard to funding programs. Although the bill does not include several provisions from <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, this should not be seen as failing to recognize the importance of the Office or the Director.  The Office has been very effective in raising the awareness of the trafficking issue and should be considered for space in the new consolidated plan for relocating offices of the Department of State closer to the Harry S. Truman Building. When the head of the Office was changed to an Ambassadorial position, the pay rate for the position was actually reduced. That decision should be reassessed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This section draws from similar versions of both <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> and <bill type="s" number="3061">S. 3061</bill>. In the new section 107A of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, subsection (b) requires a self-certification that persons or entities providing services directly to trafficking victims have completed or will complete training. This self-certification, which is not expected to be monitored in every case by the U.S. Government, is intended to apply primarily to persons actually in direct contact with and providing  services to the trafficking victims, not interns, other volunteers or administrative or supervisory staff of organizations involved in the assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This section, similar in both bills, makes a number of changes to section 108 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. With respect to the deletion of "a significant number of", the provision is intended to ensure that the broadest range of countries is reviewed by the Department. This section also separates out the provision regarding reducing the demand for commercial sex acts and participation in international sex tourism as a criteria for whether a country is making serious and  sustained efforts to combat trafficking in persons, highlighting the importance of making progress in this area as the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons makes its decisions on tier ratings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II reflects a number of changes to U.S. law, including amendments to the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act (INA), and Title 18 of the United States Code (related to federal crimes). Many of the provisions, particularly those relating to amendments to the INA, were similar in <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> and <bill type="s" number="3061">S. 3061</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 201 provides a number of modifications to provisions relating to the T and U visa category, drawing from both <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> and <bill type="s" number="3061">S. 3061</bill>. Among other matters, this section provides that a holder of a non-immigrant visa under Sections 101(A)(15)((T) or (U) of the Immigration and Nationality Act can adjust to permanent residency even if their T or U visas may have lapsed in the time period in which the adjustment regulations had not been promulgated. While adjustment regulations were released  on December 8, 2008, and will control in the future, this provision is included as a stop-gap measure for those petitioners whose adjustment petitions were not processed because of the government's failure to issue regulations until that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This section addresses the issues of employees of diplomats and officers and employees of international organizations who perform domestic services in the homes of such individuals,  drawing from provisions in section 110 of <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> as well as section 203 of <bill type="s" number="3061">S. 3061</bill>. This provision is sensitive because of its effects on reciprocity to U.S. diplomats abroad. However, the failure of the Department of State to take seriously cases involving abuse has been troubling, and this provision establishes a new framework for dealing with these cases. In particular, subsection (a)(2) provides that the Secretary of State shall suspend the issuance of certain visa classes to applicants</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This section contains a number of modifications to the federal criminal code. Section 222 conforms the various crimes set forth in Title 18, United States Code, Chapter 77 ((Peonage, Slavery, and Trafficking in Persons) by extending the obstruction provisions of the Peonage statute (Section 1581) to the other substantive servitude offenses, by creating conspiracy liability within the Chapter, and by improving the treatment of restitution and asset forfeiture. None of those provisions are intended  to foreclose the use of corresponding sections of the criminal code, where appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 222 also clarifies the definition of coercion in the core offenses created by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which responded to the Supreme Court's narrowing of the federal Involuntary Servitude statutes in United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988). Section 1589 covers offenses involving forms of forced labor, while Section 1591 is in the context of commercial sexual activity and can also be violated when a person uses a child for prostitution, as children  are unable to give consent to commercial sexual activity. Those offenses returned the legal standard for a servitude conviction to the modern approach reflected in such cases as United States v. Mussry, 726 F.2d 1448 ( 9th Cir. 1984) and the lower court decisions in Kozminski (allowing conviction in servitude cases involving psychological coercion as well as overt violence).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 crafted Section 1589 and 1591 to only require a showing of a threat of "serious harm," or of a scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that such harm would occur. The term "serious harm" refers to a broad array of harms, including both physical and nonphysical, and is intended to be subjectively construed in determining whether a particular type or certain degree of harm or coercion is sufficient to overcome  a particular victim's will. Section 222 further clarifies these concepts to reflect the various and subtle forms of coercion used by traffickers in light of the experiences of prosecutors and non-governmental organizations in combating trafficking and assisting victims. Such modification was contemplated by the drafters of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (Pub. Law 106-386):</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, Section 222 clarifies that "[t]he term `abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process' means the use or threatened use of a law or legal process, whether administrative, civil or criminal, in any manner or for any purpose for which the law was not designed, in order to exert pressure on another person to cause that person to take some action or refrain from taking some action," and that "The term `serious harm' means any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological,  financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing [in the case of section 1589, labor or services, or, in the case of section 1591, commercial sexual activity] in order to avoid incurring that harm." It is contemplated that these refinements will streamline the jury's consideration in cases involving coercion and will more fully capture the imbalance of power between trafficker</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another modification to Chapter 77 made by section 222 involves the level of scienter necessary for a violation of Section 1591. The current standard is enhanced through the addition of a "reckless disregard" option. Such an approach is well-established in other federal criminal statutes, and would have the advantage of reaching those who turn a willfully blind eye toward a person in commercial sexual activity who is being physically abused or is underage. Such an approach puts the responsibility  on participants in commercial sex activity to not ignore indicia of abuse, such as bruising or distress, or indicia of youth on the part of those whom they recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, obtain, or maintain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, a special evidentiary provision is added for those cases under Section 1591(a)(1) in which criminal liability attaches not because of the use of coercion but because of the use of a minor for commercial sexual activity. In such cases, the prosecution will be exempted from having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant who had a reasonable opportunity to observe the person recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained or maintained knew that the person  had not attained the age of 18 years. This special evidentiary provision reflects a similar provision in the aggravated sexual abuse offense, Title 18, United States Code, Section 2241(d), and is crafted in light of United States v. X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. 64, 70, n.2 (1994) (exception from presumption of mens rea more appropriate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 222 also creates a new fraud crime, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1351, which prohibits the recruiting, solicitation, or hiring, with intent to defraud, foreign persons to be employed in the United States through false pretenses, representations, or promises about their employment. For the purposes of this provision, "employment" is presumed to include, but not be limited to, such issues as terms and conditions of employment, housing, labor broker fees, employer or broker-provided  food and transportation, ability to work outside of the offered place of employment, and other material aspects of the recruited person's work and life in America. This statute is intended to capture situations in which exploitative employers and recruiters have lured heavily-indebted workers to the United States, but did not obtain their labor or services through coercion sufficient to reach the level of the Chapter 77 Slavery/Trafficking offenses. Press accounts and Congressional briefings have highlighted cases with facts as egregious as situations in which defrauded workers were stranded in fenced compounds, reduced to catching pigeons for food and</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> updated Title 8, United States Code, Section 1328, a long-established statute that criminalizes the importation of aliens for immoral purposes and the harboring or employment of aliens so imported. The bill does not include this update, but rather directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to assess the sentencing guideline pertaining to alien harboring, 18 United States Code, Section 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii), to determine whether the guideline for harboring should conform to the Mann Act guideline  when the harboring was committed in furtherance of prostitution and the defendant is an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor. Section 1324 is a more modern statute, penalizing harboring even without proof that it was done in furtherance of illegal importation. The elements of a 1324 offense do not vary based on the purpose for which the alien is being harbored. For instance, there is no difference in the knowledge required</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This section, reflective of some of the goals of section 224 of the <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill>, provides that nothing in previous acts related to trafficking, this Act, and any model law related to trafficking promulgated by the Department of Justice shall be read to legitimize prostitution as a valid form of labor, or to preempt, supplant or limit the effect of any State or Federal criminal law. In particular, it should be noted that financial transactions involving the proceeds of any trafficking activities,  or any failure to report income obtained through any trafficking activities would remain reachable by applicable federal statutes, irrespective of the provision of section 225(a)(1).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many states have modernized archaic slavery or forced prostitution statutes in line with the TVPA or the model state laws promulgated by the Department of Justice or non-governmental organizations. In recognition that many state statutes in the closely related area of prostitution enforcement are also antiquated, the bill directs the Department of Justice to supplement its current anti-trafficking model law with modern anti-prostitution models, so that a holistic update is available for policymakers'  use. Section 225 will also require that the new model law be distributed to each Attorney General as a means of promoting the new model law. The bill also will result in dissemination of a chapter of the Criminal Code of the District of Columbia as an example of a statute that reaches as felonies cases involving coercion, pandering, and exploitation alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 238 mandates a report from the Department of Homeland Security concerning the work of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Unit at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Vermont Service Center. The VAWA Unit is a highly-trained adjudication team that is responsible for a number of victim-related immigration applications, including but not limited to: the adjudications, adjustments, work authorizations, parole, fax-back benefits and employment verification, naturalization,  and derivative beneficiaries related to such programs as Violence Against Women Act self-petitions (Section 101(a)(51) of the Immigration and Nationality Act); T visas (Section 101(a)(15)(T) of the Immigration and Nationality Act), U-visas (Section 101(a)(15)(U) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; battered spouse waivers (Section 216(c)(4)); abused immigrant</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mandated report seeks information on funding, staffing, and training. The Unit should continue to be the responsible office for the processing of victim-related immigration applications, and such processing should be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable confidentiality requirements. Off-site adjudication of such applications should be considered an extraordinary circumstance, and if cases must be adjudicated elsewhere, special care should be taken to ensure compliance with confidentiality  and adjudication standards of the Unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other violent crimes should not have to wait for up to a year before they can support themselves and their families. The Vermont Service Center should therefore strive to issue work authorization and deferred action in most instances within 60 days of filing, consistent with the need for safe and competent adjudication. The mandated report therefore seeks information on the timing adjudications, and steps taken to improve on this aspect  of the Unit's mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The staff of the Unit are widely respected as experts in the effect of trauma and victimization and the heightened confidentiality mandated by the Violence Against Women Act, and have historically been not only an adjudication team but a policy resource. The mandated report thus includes a description of measures taken to ensure that the policy expertise of the Unit is fully incorporated into decision-making by the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PROVISIONS FROM <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> NOT INCLUDED IN BILL</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several provisions from <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> do not appear in this version of the legislation. For example, the original House bill attempted to streamline the investigation and prosecution of certain sex trafficking and related offenses by amending the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. &#xA7;2421, et seq. The Wilberforce Act reflects a different consensus, and achieves these ends through modifications to the Slavery/Trafficking Chapter of Title 18 discussed above.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specific language regarding the surveys required by section 232 of <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> is not included in the bill. However, the provisions of paragraph (B)(i) and (ii) of section 201(a)(1) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 14044(a)) still require that the surveys contained in that provision be completed, and section 237(d) requires the Department of Justice to provide the relevant committees a report on the status of those surveys, including the projected date  when such surveys will be completed. Also, section 234 of <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> proposed a reorganization of functions within the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice should review the relationship between the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division and the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Criminal Division and promote</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because efforts in the closely-related area of prostitution enforcement are important to prevent situations from ripening into servitude, the reporting requirements of Section 237 are intended to gain a better understanding of the Criminal Division and United States Attorneys Offices' activities to enforce the Mann Act or those local prostitution offenses that United States Attorneys may have jurisdiction over through operation of the District of Columbia Criminal Code or the Travel Act 18 U.S.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title III</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title III authorizes funds for programs, projects and activities related to human trafficking. In order to promote broad support for the bill, some of the authorization for program funding was reduced to levels closer to previously appropriated levels, and therefore represents a more realistic target for future spending. Any reductions in authorizations are not intended to indicate a decrease in the importance of any programs, but indeed are intended to encourage appropriations at those new levels.  It should be noted that Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is engaging in a number of important investigatory activities abroad and should continue to be fully supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IV</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IV is drawn from title IV of both <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> and <bill type="s" number="3061">S. 3061</bill>. The two versions were substantially similar, and the intent of title IV is described in House Report 110-430. As in both bills, section 404, revised from the text of both <bill type="h" number="3887">H.R. 3887</bill> and <bill type="s" number="3061">S. 3061</bill>, provides that no assistance under section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act (relating to transfers of excess defense articles), section 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act (relating to international military education and training) and section  23 of the Arms Export Control Act (relating to foreign military financing) shall be provided, and no licenses for commercial arm sales may be issued, to countries that are determined to be using or permitting the use of child soldiers in governmental armed forces or government-supported armed forces. While requiring enhanced reporting on child soldiers in the annual country reports on human rights, the actual list of countries that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
