  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, last week when the Senate considered the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, I offered an amendment, numbered 2406, with my good friend and partner from Montana, Jon Tester. Our amendment would bar funds appropriated in the Homeland Security appropriations bill from being used to establish a national ID card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Benjamin Franklin once said, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generations of Americans have fought for both our liberty and safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's Founders sought the freedom to lead their lives as they chose--freedom of religion, speech, and assembly. Freedom, above all other motives, led them to cross the ocean find a new home in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether defending our liberty from British colonial governors, Nazi aggression, or today's Islamic radicals, Americans have never tired in their effort to stand up in defense of our liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But sometimes the threat to liberty is not as obvious as a red-coated army or a German panzer division. Sometimes, the threat is much harder to see but just as dangerous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The threat I speak of today is a national ID card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A national ID card may sound harmless to some. Indeed, a number of politicians have called for giving every citizen a national ID card. They argue that a national identification card would make it harder for terrorists to use fake identification to enter the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But a national ID card has the potential to be abused. Such a card could become a system of identity papers, databases, status and identity checks, and Federal surveillance used to track and control individuals' movements and activities. It could, in effect, create an internal U.S. passport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some have argued that a national ID is essential to protecting Americans from terrorism. I strongly disagree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This act provided a number of improvements to our Nation's driver's licenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support these reasonable efforts to secure our State driver's licenses from terrorists. However, a national ID card would just give Government bureaucrats another chance to meddle in the private lives of regular law-abiding Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to get on a plane, go in a Federal building, or drive down the road, you would have to have the permission of some bureaucrat in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If a national ID card were established, we would be right back here on the Senate floor debating whether citizens would be required to carry them at all times or pondering what citizens are allowed to do without a national ID card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A National ID card would be a terrible loss of freedom in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreign countries with the worst civil liberties records in the world require their citizens to carry a national ID at all times. They have legal punishments for people caught without their IDs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take Zimbabwe, for example. They passed a law in November which required all citizens to carry a national ID. Citizens face a fine or imprisonment if they refuse to carry the ID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History has taught us that national ID cards can lead to dangerous and destructive government policies. National ID cards played important roles in the genocides of both Nazi Germany and Rwanda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The apartheid-era Government of South Africa used national identification documents as internal passports to oppress the country's native population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, a national ID would be wrong for the United States. I am proud to say my home State of Montana would be the first to reject any effort to impose this sort of system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Montana's leadership has spoken, and I have heard them loud and clear; get the Federal Government out of the business of telling the States how to produce driver's licenses and ID cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend, Montana's Governor Brian Schweitzer, signed a law in April that bans Montana's Department of Motor Vehicles from enforcing the requirements of the Real ID act. Republicans and Democrats alike in Montana's Legislature have voted unanimously to reject Real ID. I am proud of Montana's vigilant stand against the Federal Government's encroachment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is wrong for politicians in Washington to burden State authorities with excessive regulations. We must allow our States to take initiatives as well. We should never try to micromanage them. They know how to do their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President this is not a partisan issue. Organizations from the left, the ACLU, join hands with groups from the right, the NRA, and raise serious concerns about the establishment of a national ID card.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join the chorus of Americans and support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to amplify my brief earlier statement regarding my vote against the DeMint amendment No. 2481 to the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 28, 2007, during Senate consideration of the Improving America's Security by Implementing Unfinished Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, there were two side-by-side votes on amendments related to criminal offenses which disqualify an applicant from receiving a transportation worker identification credential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first vote was on an amendment offered by Senator Inouye. This amendment, amendment No. 285, specified certain criminal offenses which would disqualify an applicant from receiving the transportation worker identification credential but gave the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to add to or modify the listed offenses in a rulemaking. I voted in favor of this amendment because I believe the Secretary ought to have the authority to modify the existing list of crimes  when circumstances warrant a regulatory change, and the amendment was adopted by a vote of 58 to 37.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second vote was on an amendment offered by Senator DeMint. This amendment, amendment No. 279, was identical to the previous amendment offered by Senator Inouye aside from its omission of Secretarial authority to modify the list of existing offenses. Since these amendments were in direct contradiction with one another over the issue of granting the Secretary authority to modify the existing list, I voted against the DeMint amendment. Nevertheless, it was adopted by a vote  of 94 to 2, with 56 Senators voting to contradict the position they had taken on the previous amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, when the question came up on the DeMint amendment No. 2481 to the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which would have prohibited funds provided in the act from being expended by the Secretary to remove offenses from the list of criminal offenses disqualifying individuals from receiving a transportation worker identification credential, I voted against it, not only because I believe it is sound public policy to require flexibility on such matters but also because  it was consistent with my position on the Inouye amendment to the Improving America's Security by Implementing Unfinished Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The DeMint amendment No. 2481 was adopted by a vote of 93 to 1 even though it was again in direct contradiction to the position taken by the Senate when it adopted the Inouye amendment to the Improving America's Security by Implementing Unfinished Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I was pleased to support the fiscal year 2008 Homeland Security appropriations bill. Our national security strategy needs to adapt in order to meet new and emerging threats while ensuring those in charge of protecting us have the resources they need. I am pleased to support the current Homeland Security appropriations bill which includes many important measures to keep our communities safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate unanimously accepted my amendment to improve the Safe Skies program that I established a few years ago. The amendment will encourage the Transportation Security Administration and the airlines to better implement legislation I authored that allows first responders to volunteer to help flight crews in the event of an onboard emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would increase funding for State fire fighter and emergency management grants. Along with a bipartisan coalition of Senators, I wrote to Senate appropriators earlier in the year asking that they increase funding for these important grants. The appropriators agreed with our recommendations and recommended $700,000,000 for fire fighter grants and $300,000,000 for emergency management performance grants. These funds will help State and local agencies obtain the equipment and training they  need to protect us against terrorist incidents and natural disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was disappointed that an amendment I cosponsored to fund decontamination units for the National Guard's Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams, WMD-CST, did not receive a vote. As a result of legislation I authored, every State in this Nation now has a functional WMD-CST. The Department of Defense recently announced that it will soon finalize the certifications of all of these teams. I will continue to work to ensure that the National Guard receives the funds it needs to perform its  homeland security operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would appropriate the funds needed to hire 3,000 additional border patrol agents. This important provision will help us secure our borders and restore credibility to our immigration system. While I was deeply disappointed that the Senate was unable to reach a bipartisan compromise to implement comprehensive immigration reform, I am pleased that the bill will help improve our border security. I also supported an amendment offered by Senator Graham to appropriate an additional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would permit States to enact chemical security regulations that are stronger than Federal regulations. Chemical security regulations are an urgent homeland security priority, and I support the ability of the States to set tougher standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wisconsin residents and Americans across the country are concerned about the serious backlog in passport application process. This bill would delay the implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative to keep the backlog from increasing until we have a chance to resolve this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted to table an amendment offered by Senator Alexander that would have reduced funding for border, port and air security in order to provide increased funding for implementation of the REAL ID Act. That act is deeply flawed. While I am concerned that it remains an unfunded priority, I am also concerned that, if we head down the road of funding this misguided policy, the Senate will not take the necessary steps to reform the REAL ID Act. Moreover, the National Governors Association  has estimated that the cost of implementing the REAL ID Act could reach $11 billion, which means that the increased funding provided by this amendment, $400 million, would do little to address the unfunded mandate of REAL ID while taking away money for pressing homeland security priorities. I will continue to push for reform of the REAL ID Act, to provide for proper funding of any Federal mandate in the reformed act, and to ensure that the implementation of the act is not rushed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are still spending almost twice as much on Iraq as is allocated for homeland security, diplomacy, and international assistance combined. The billions we spend each month in Iraq could be better invested in the protection of critical infrastructure and our system of national preparedness and response that failed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. As we consider the defense appropriation this fall, I encourage my colleagues to take a broader view when it comes to our national security priorities  and make the tradeoffs that must be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would significantly increase spending on homeland security. I do not take lightly a decision to vote in favor of spending the taxpayers' money. Fiscal responsibility is one of my highest priorities, but it is imperative that we provide the resources needed to combat al-Qaida and its affiliates and protect the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the bill would appropriate funds to double the frequency of spot checks at regulated port facilities across the country, to conduct vulnerability assessments at 10 high risk ports, to create a radiation detection test center to help scan cargo and to purchase and install explosives detection equipment at airports. Much more remains to be done. I will continue to work to ensure that our national security strategies address the range of  threats  we face and properly prioritizes homeland security.</paragraph>
