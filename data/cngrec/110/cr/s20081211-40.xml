  <narrative>ANNOUNCING CHRISTOPHER JAMES DUFFIELD -- (Senate - December 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10937">S10937</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to announce to the Senate the arrival of another Duffield in this world. Christopher James Duffield was born to his parents, Steven and Cara, on the third day of November. Christopher's father Steven served as the executive director of the Platform Committee at this year's Republican Convention in Minneapolis. Prior to that, Steven served as a senior policy advisor and chief counsel to me at the Republican Policy Committee and the Senate Republican Conference.  Christopher's mother, Cara, is a partner at the law firm of Wiley Rein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christopher joins us at what is a tumultuous and difficult time for both the Nation and the Republican Party. On November 4, we Republicans fared poorly in Federal elections, losing the Presidency and deepening our deficit in the House and Senate. The new majority promises to cure the Nation's economic ills with a Keynesian spending spree of the type that worked so brilliantly in the 1930s, and pledges that it will reduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans, while only increasing them for some  other guy. Many fear that the coming years will put the test to Alexis de Tocqueville's warning that "the American Republic will endure, until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their own money."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, since September of this year, the United States has experienced a severe financial crisis, precipitated by the collapse of banks that have been overwhelmed by the weight of unsound mortgages that they acquired. Many established and storied financial institutions have disappeared in bankruptcies and mergers during the last few months. As lending has tightened, unemployment has increased, and  the Nation appears to be headed into a deep recession.  And on November 26, as if to remind us that the other problems confronting our nation have not receded, a group of Islamic terrorists attacked innocent civilians in the Indian city of Bombay, killing 171 people. Those attacks reminded many of us of the evil that this Nation faced on September 11, 2001, and of the long war that still lies ahead of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet--and yet, things are not so bad. The United States is about to complete another peaceful democratic transition, and has just elected its first African-American President, giving hope to many that the Nation will yet overcome its racial divisions. The current credit crisis is not unlike ones that we have survived in the past, and our understanding of the financial system and how to fix it certainly is much deeper than it was in 1929. And, had you asked Americans 7 years ago, very few then  would have dared to guess that the United States would not suffer any foreign terrorist attacks on its soil during these ensuing 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican Party, though currently unloved, will return to its roots and eventually regain the confidence of the American people. And though Republicans will be out of power in the political branches, the current President, with a little help from his friends, has made two very fine appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, restoring a semblance of the rule of law to that branch of government for the first time in many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans' loss of the Presidency may even have some salutary effects. Already, there are signs that with a Democrat coming to the White House, our Nation's liberal press may relent in its 8-year assault on the authority of the executive branch. On the day that Christopher was born, I and many others picked up the New York Times and nearly spilled our coffee when we came across a front-page article that was titled: "Next President Will Face Test on Detainees--Some at Guantanamo Called  Serious Risks." I will ask that a copy of this article be printed in the Record following my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For at least 5 years now, anyone who relied on the New York Times as a source of information about the world was liable to come away with the impression that the men held by our military at the Guantanamo Naval Station are detained there purely out of spite or out of some other even less pure motive. News stories about Guantanamo have credited every accusation made by the detainees and their lawyers, no matter how implausible, but would treat with great skepticism any evidence that the Guantanamo  detentions are necessary--that is, on the rare occasion when the papers could even be bothered to report such evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet just as a Democratic Presidential victory began to seem inevitable, the New York Times treats us to this article. We learn therein that many of the detainees have participated in terrorist attacks against Americans, are skilled in bombmaking and other terrorist arts, or have announced that they would like nothing better than to return to killing innocent people. For some of us, it is not news that the men detained at Guantanamo are dangerous. I would invite my colleagues to review the  minority views that I and others submitted for Senate Report 110-90, or Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in the Boumediene case. And on November 3, for the first time, such information is not news even to those who trust the New York Times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public-relations victories like this one are important, for ultimately our enemies do not expect to defeat us on the battlefield. Rather, they seek to win by sowing fear, by demoralizing us, and by weakening our will to defend ourselves. Their particular brand of medieval barbarism will never sustain a civilization capable of defeating us in a conventional battle, but even a powerful nation such as ours must be willing to fight if it is to prevail against such an enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that Steven and Cara will instill in young Christopher, and his sister Laura, an appreciation and respect for our Nation, its unique institutions, and its open and democratic culture. It is just such people, who understand this country and its virtues, who ultimately will ensure that the American way of life continues and even thrives. And it is thus with hope for the future that I welcome young Christopher James Duffield to this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following news article be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>[From the New York Times, Nov. 3, 2008]</narrative>
  <narrative>Next President Will Face Test On Detainees</narrative>
  <narrative>SOME AT GUANTANAMO CALLED SERIOUS RISKS &lt;center&gt;(By William Glaberson and Margot Williams) &lt;/center&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>They were called the Dirty 30--bodyguards tor Osama bin Laden captured early in the Afghanistan war--and many of them are still being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Others still at the much-criticized detention camp there include prisoners who the government says were trained in assassination and the use of poisons and disguises.</narrative>
  <narrative>One detainee is said to have been schooled in making detonators out of Sega game cartridges. A Yemeni who has received little public attention was originally selected by Mr. bin Laden as a potential Sept. 11 hijacker, intelligence officials say.</narrative>
  <narrative>As the Bush administration enters its final months with no apparent plan to close the Guantanamo Bay camp, an extensive review of the government's military tribunal files suggests that dozens of the roughly 255 prisoners remaining in detention are said by military and intelligence agencies to have been captured with important terrorism suspects, to have connections to top Al Qaeda leaders or to have other serious terrorism credentials.</narrative>
  <narrative>Senators John McCain and Barack Obama have said they would close the detention camp, but the review of the government's public files underscores the challenges of fulfilling that promise. The next president will have to contend with sobering intelligence claims against many of the remaining detainees.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It would be very difficult for a new president to come in and say, `I don't believe what the C.I.A. is saying about these guys," said Daniel Marcus, a Democrat who was general counsel of the 9/11 Commission and held senior positions in the Carter and Clinton administrations.</narrative>
  <narrative>The strength of the evidence is difficult to assess, because the government has kept much of it secret and because of questions about whether some was gathered through torture.</narrative>
  <narrative>When the administration has had to defend its accusations in court, government lawyers in several cases have retreated from the most serious claims. As a result, critics have raised doubts about the danger of Guantanamo's prisoners beyond a handful of the camp's most notorious detainees.</narrative>
  <narrative>But as a new administration begins to sort through the government's dossiers on the men, the analysis shows, officials are likely to face tough choices in deciding how many of Guantanamo's hard cases should be sent home, how many should be charged and what to do with the rest.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Pentagon has declined to provide a list of the detainees now being held or even to specify how many there are beyond offering a figure of "about 255." But by reviewing thousands of pages of government documents released in recent years, as well as court records and news media reports from around the world, The New York Times was able to compile its own list and construct a picture of the population still held at Guantanamo. Much of the analysis is based on records of hearings at Guantanamo  about individual detainees, which have been made public since 2006 as a result of an Associated Press law suit. The Times has posted those documents on its Web site arranged by detainee name.</narrative>
  <narrative>The analysis shows that about 34 of the remaining detainees were seized in raids in Pakistan that netted three men the government calls major Qaeda operatives: Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Al Hajj Abdu Ali Shargawi. Sixteen detainees are accused of some of the most significant terrorist attacks in the last decade, including the 1998 American embassy bombings, the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and the Sept. 11 attacks. Twenty others were called Mr. bin Laden's bodyguards.</narrative>
  <narrative>The analysis also shows that 13 of the original 23 detainees who arrived at Guantanamo on Jan. 11, 2002, remain there nearly seven years later. Of the approximately 255 men now being held, more than 60 have been cleared for release or transfer, according to the Pentagon, but remain at Guantanamo because of difficulties negotiating transfer agreements between the United States and other countries.</narrative>
  <narrative>Two of those still held, government documents show, were seen by Mr. bin Laden as potential Sept. 11 hijackers. The case of Mohammed al-Qahtani, whom the government has labeled a potential "20th hijacker," has drawn wide notice because he was subjected to interrogation tactics that included sleep deprivation, isolation and being put on a leash and forced to perform dog tricks.</narrative>
  <narrative>The other detainee deemed a potential hijacker, whose presence at Guantanamo has gone virtually unmentioned in public reports, is a Yemeni called Abu Bara. The 9/11 Commission said he studied flights and airport security and participated in an important planning meeting for the 2001 attack in Malaysia in January 2000.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Guantanamo list also includes two Saudi brothers, Hassan and Walid bin Attash. The government describes them as something like Qaeda royalty. Military officials said during Guantanamo hearings that their father, imprisoned in Saudi Arabia, was a "close contact of Osama bin Laden" and that his sons were committed jihadists.</narrative>
  <narrative>Walid bin Attash is facing a possible death sentence as a coordinator of the Sept. 11 attacks. Hassan bin Attash was alleged to have been involved in planning attacks on American oil tankers and Navy ships.</narrative>
  <narrative>Hassan bin Attash's lawyer, David H. Remes, said the government's claims about the detainees were not credible. He and other detainees' lawyers say that the government's accusations have been ever-changing and that much of the evidence was obtained using techniques he and others have described as torture. "You look at all of this stuff, and it looks terribly scary," Mr. Remes said. "But how do we  know any of it is true?"</narrative>
  <narrative>The extensive use of secret evidence and information derived from aggressive interrogations has led critics around the world to conclude that many detainees were wrongly held. Nearly seven years after Guantanamo opened its metal gates, only 18 of the current detainees are facing crimes charges.</narrative>
  <narrative>While both presidential candidates have said they would close the detention center, they have not said in detail how they would handle the remaining detainees.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. McCain has said he would move the Guantanamo detainees to the United States but has indicated that he would try them in the Pentagon's commission system established after 9/11. After the conviction at Guantanamo, last summer of a former driver for Mr. bin Laden, Mr. McCain said the verdict "demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Obama has said that the Bush administration's system of trying detainees "has been an enormous failure" and that the existing American legal system--trials in either civilian or military courts--was strong enough to handle the trials of terrorism suspects.</narrative>
  <narrative>But in a speech on the Senate floor in 2006, Mr. Obama suggested that the allegations against many of the detainees needed to be taken seriously. "Now the majority of the folks in Guantanamo, I suspect, are there for a reason," he said. "There are a lot of dangerous people."</narrative>
  <narrative>Some of the remaining prisoners have appeared determined to show how dangerous they are. "I admit to you it is my honor to be an enemy of the United States," said a Yemeni detainee, Abdul Rahman Ahmed, a hearing record shows. Officials said Mr. Ahmed had been trained at a terrorist camp "how to dress and act at an airport" and to resist interrogation.</narrative>
  <narrative>A Saudi detainee, Muhammed Murdi Issa al Zahrani, was described by Pentagon officials as a trained assassin who helped plan the suicide-bomb killing of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Afghan rebel leader, on Sept. 9, 2001.</narrative>
  <narrative>"The detainee said America is ruled by the Jews," an officer said at a hearing after interviewing Mr. Zahrani, "therefore America and Israel are his enemies."</narrative>
  <narrative>One man caught with Abu Zubaydah insisted on his innocence but described a training camp outside Kabul, Afghanistan, where, according to information he gave to interrogators, men were given "lessons on how to make poisons that could be inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the skin."</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. bin al Shibh was caught with a group of six Yemenis, all of whom are still held, after a two-and-a-half-hour gun battle. The records of those detainees include allegations that some were "a special terrorist team deployed to attack targets in Karachi." One of the men, Hail Aziz Ahmad al Maythal, was trained in the use of rocket-propelled grenade launchers, machine guns and "trench digging, disguise techniques, escape methods, evasion and map reading," according to the military's allegations.</narrative>
  <narrative>The records include many of the murky cases that typify the image of Guantanamo, where detainees take issue with their own supposed confessions and, sometimes, their identities. And those doubts too are to be part of a new administration's inheritance.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I was forced to say all these things," an Algerian detainee, Adil Hadi al Jazairi bin Hamlili, said at his hearing when confronted with his confession to murder and knowledge of a plot to sell uranium to Al Qaeda. "I was abused mentally and psychologically, by threatening to be raped," he said, adding, "You would say anything."</narrative>
  <narrative>Abdul Hafiz, an Afghan accused of killing a Red Cross worker at a Taliban roadblock in 2003, told a military officer that he had the perfect alibi. "The detainee states again that he is not Abdul Hafiz," the officer reported to a military tribunal.</narrative>
