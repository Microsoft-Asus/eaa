  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak to this important issue that we have been talking about that has been brought to the floor by Congressman Larson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, the pendulum seems to be swinging in an opposite direction as relates to our young people. According to the Center for Disease Control, homicide is the second leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds in this country. More closely, homicide is a leading cause of death for African Americans the ages of 10 to 24, the second leading cause of death for Hispanics ages in the same category, and the third leading cause of death for Native Americans, Alaskans, and Asian Pacific  Islanders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent shootings in Omaha, Nebraska; Cleveland, Ohio; Blacksburg, Virginia; and actually my own hometown of Newark, New Jersey, have shone a harsh light on the rising crime epidemic plaguing our country. Our country has a proliferation of weapons. It is estimated that there are 300 million weapons in this country, one for every man, woman, and child. There seems to be a romance in some areas with guns, the fact that they can be purchased so easily in many parts of our country. Our State of  New Jersey has one of the strongest antigun laws in the country; however, people can come in from other States and bring them in. We had four children, four young people, college students executed, four at one time, in a playground, almost gangster type.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we have to do something to stop this epidemic which is plaguing  our country. We as a Nation, and particularly here in Congress, have a sobering choice to make: We can either continue to bury our heads in the sand and hide behind our tough-on-crime rhetoric and placing the sole blame on things like violent music and video games, or we can be proactive so that we can start seeing real reduction in crime. There are options available to us that are  more cost-effective and life-saving than throwing increased resources into cameras and metal detectors and security guards and prisons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let it not be misconstrued that I believe that these are not important factors in our society. We certainly have to segregate violent criminals from the society. However, if we continue to unwisely spend an overwhelming amount of our constrained resources on this, we will continue to lose on the war on crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to CNN, cost analyses show that for every dollar spent on youth violence prevention, $14 is saved on what would have otherwise been spent in the criminal justice system. And so many times an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, as earlier mentioned, the disparity between crack cocaine and powdered cocaine led the sentencing commission once again to say this is discriminatory, it is absolutely wrong to have a 5-year minimum sentence, mandatory, for crack cocaine. But for the same amount, or even 10 times more, and I believe it even goes up to 100 times more for powder cocaine, you can have a suspended sentence. That is absolutely wrong. I am glad that the sentencing commission and the judiciary now  are saying we should change this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I am proud to say in New Jersey, just this past week, for the first State in the Union to ban by legislative action the death penalty in the State senate, and today that is being considered in the assembly, is I think really a just way for our State to move. So let me say that I commend Congressman Larson.</paragraph>
