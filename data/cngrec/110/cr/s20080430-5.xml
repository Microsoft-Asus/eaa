  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3553">S3553</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following my remarks and those of Mr. McConnell, if he decides to make such remarks, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="h" number="2881">H.R. 2881</bill>, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. Senator Durbin will be recognized to offer an amendment on his behalf and that of Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a reminder, the joint meeting of Congress with the Prime Minister of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, is today at 11 a.m. Senators attending the meeting will gather in the Senate at 10:30 a.m. and proceed as a body to the Hall of the House at 10:40 a.m. In order to accommodate the joint meeting, the Senate will then be in recess from 10:40 until 12 noon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the first amendment is a bipartisan amendment that will be offered, as I have indicated, by Senator Durbin and Senator Hutchison. I am going to have another conversation with the distinguished Republican leader as soon as he completes his statement here today, to see if we can figure out an orderly way to proceed on this very important piece of legislation. I think the managers have a good feel of this legislation. They think it is something we can complete fairly  quickly. We just have to make sure we legislate on the FAA aspect of what is going on in the world today and not other things that have no bearing on this issue. We will see what we can work out. Hopefully, we can have a good day today and, with a little bit of good fortune, finish this bill this week.</paragraph>
