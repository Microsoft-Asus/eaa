    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to Sandra Cook who retired last week from the Department of Education. For almost 20 years, Sandra has worked in the Office of Legislative and Congressional Affairs at the Department, providing invaluable and dedicated service. She will be missed by all who worked with her, both at the Department and in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving education for each and every child in this country is one of the most important priorities for our Nation, and Sandra has been committed to that priority throughout her dedicated service. Her commitment to education began in the classroom in Indiana as a teacher of history and language arts. She came to Washington to work in Congress and then moved to the Department of Education. From there she has provided constant guidance and support to us as we work to improve Federal education  policy. She has been an indispensable part of the past two reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--the Improving America's Schools Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, as well as many other Federal education bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all owe Sandra an immense debt of gratitude for her outstanding work. She knows the education laws inside and out, and she always goes the extra mile. She has always been able to work in a truly bipartisan way with Members of both parties. She doesn't just get the job done--she gets it done well, and with grace. We have been fortunate to have her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Sandra retires to Illinois, I know her colleagues at the Department of Education will miss her. Her knowledge and skills will be difficult to replace. Certainly, all of us in Congress and our staffs who have had the privilege of working with her will miss her assistance and support. I wish her a long and happy and healthy retirement. She has certainly earned it.</paragraph>
