  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the Resource Family Recruitment and Retention Act of 2008, which was introduced on September 16, 2008, by my good friend Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. This is an important piece of legislation, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long been a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption and worked in a bipartisan manner to support adoptive and foster parents and children. In 1997, I strongly advocated for the passage of the Adoption and Safe Families Act which has made a significant difference in the lives of vulnerable children. Since the implementation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, the number of children adopted out of foster care has more than doubled. In West Virginia alone, more than 3,600 children  have been adopted out of the West Virginia foster care system. This is a real victory for these children who deserve the love and comfort of a safe, permanent home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, with more than 500,000 children still in foster care, it is clear that more needs to be done. This is why I was so pleased when the Senate passed the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act by unanimous consent. This legislation will provide additional support for grandparents and other relatives who provide a safe home for children in foster care. Additionally, this legislation will allow states to continue to assist older foster children, those who are 18, 19,  20, or 21 years old, so that these children aging out of the system do not have to choose between pursuing an education or working to prevent becoming homeless. I believe that this legislation is another step towards the ultimate goal of each child having a safe, permanent home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lincoln's legislation would also help bring us closer to this goal. A study conducted in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that one in five foster homes leaves the system each year. One-fifth of the foster parent population provides 60 to 80 percent of all foster care. Foster parents sacrifice in tremendous ways to provide a home for vulnerable children. The Resource Family Recruitment and Retention Act would support their efforts by awarding grants  to States to improve the leadership, support, training, recruitment, and retention of foster care, kinship care, and adoptive parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that organizations and individuals such as Mr. Dennis Sutton of the Children's Home Society of West Virginia, who has worked tirelessly in his effort to secure a home for all of West Virginia's vulnerable children, will have the financial support to find and retain enough foster parents to make this goal a reality. Foster and adoptive parents will greatly benefit from the Resource Family Recruitment and Retention Act, but the big winners will be the children who are placed loving  homes. We need to invest and focus on these families.</paragraph>
