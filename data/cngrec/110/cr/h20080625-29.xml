  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="">
    <paragraph>On this day, on this very day 58 years ago, North Korea invaded South Korea. Over the course of the next 3 years after that invasion until July 27 of 1953, until that armistice brought a halt to the fighting, more than 36,000 Americans died, and more than 1.5 million South Korean soldiers and civilians became casualties of that act of aggression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of this conflict, the Republic of Korea has flourished, becoming the world's 11th largest economy and becoming the United States' 7th largest trading partner. Seoul is a vibrant city which has hosted the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As cochairman of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Interparliamentary Exchange, I have had the chance to see this miraculous growth up close in South Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as is inscribed in the Korean War Memorial here in Washington, D.C., it is important that we never forget those who nobly sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom and liberty.</paragraph>
