  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="CORPORAL DUSTIN LEE WORKMAN II">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Army CPL Dustin Lee Workman II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his graduation in 2005 from Ashland-Greenwood High School in Ashland, Nebraska, Corporal Workman joined the Nebraska National Guard. His friends and family describe him as an iron-willed person, and as someone who was deeply in touch with his faith. One of his former teachers described him as a talented and creative writer. In fact, Corporal Workman, who was not yet 20 years old, composed a poem, which was set to music by one of his friends and sang at his funeral. I attended the funeral,  and it was a moving rendition. The poem follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 28, 2007, Corporal Workman passed away due to combat injuries sustained from an improvised explosive device while serving in Iraq. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, based in Fort Carson, CO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Workman is survived by his father, Dustin, Sr.; mother, Valerie; and two younger siblings, Korey and Krysta. I join all Americans in grieving the loss of a patriot and a beloved friend, brother, and son.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="SERGEANT NATHAN L. WINDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to honor and commemorate one of Utah's fallen sons. SFC Nathan L. Winder was a native of Blanding, Utah, and a member of the 1st Special Forces Group stationed at Fort Lewis, WA. I have been informed that this good soldier tragically lost his life as he and his U.S. Special Forces Quick Reaction team came to the aid of another unit that was ambushed and taking on small-arms fire in Ad Diwaniyah, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after graduating from high school, Sergeant Winder left his home in Blanding, UT, to pursue a career in the Armed Forces. In 2006, he graduated from the special forces qualification course in Fort Bragg, NC, and earned the coveted Green Beret.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a 2-year-old boy, he was abandoned on the steps of a courthouse in Seoul, South Korea. Shortly after, he was offered a better life and a new beginning in the loving home of Tom and Teri Winder, incredible parents of 20 children. In his parents' eyes, it was from his abandonment and subsequent adoption that he developed the fierce desire to offer others the same kind of hope that was offered him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his life, it was clear that Sergeant Winder had a special place in his heart for children. His family remembers how he often remarked in his e-mails that Iraqi children seemed so appreciative of the little things, like a wave from a U.S. soldier, a smile, or even a small piece of candy. Teri Winder said of her son, "He loved the children. He gave them a sense that they were cared about." He did everything he could to offer them the hope he so gratefully received so many years ago.  He was known for always carrying toys and candy to hand out to the Iraqi children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Winder was a man who lived his life with a profound purpose, deeply rooted in his convictions of moral reciprocity. His greatest desire was to take the freedom afforded to him and offer it to those who had none. Tom Winder said his son wanted the people in Iraq, if only for a moment, to feel some sense of freedom, however seemingly minute its manifestation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to two wonderful parents and 19 brothers and sisters, Sergeant Winder is survived by his wife Mechelle and an 11-year-old son. This great soldier and his family will always be in my memory and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I also pay tribute to SGT Nathan S. Barnes of American Fork, UT, who recently gave his life during a combat mission in Iraq. Sergeant Barnes was a member of the 10th Mountain Division's 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment stationed out of Fort Drum, NY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been informed that 400 American flags lined the streets leading to the Sergeant Barnes's family home in American Fork. I also understand that on the day of his funeral, hundreds of Boy Scouts, each bearing a U.S. flag and standing at attention, gathered along either side of the street to honor the fallen soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the kind of tribute this brave and selfless soldier merits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Barnes is remembered by his family members and fellow soldiers for his love of friends and family, and for his humor, his commitment to serving the country and his profound dedication to his faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Barnes was a man who truly lived an abundant life. When not engaged in the service of his country, the soldier enjoyed spending time outdoors jogging, hiking, camping, and hunting. Friends and family recall his insatiable appetite for good literature. All of these interests and hobbies were part of Sergeant Barnes' unique way of exploring what life had to offer him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would submit to you this day, Mr. President, that in a time when patriotism is a virtue often overlooked and lost in the midst of the swirl of issues, Sergeant Barnes' sacrifice brings us back to the core of what it means to be a patriot. I hope and pray that his sacrifice will inspire us all to reach for new levels of excellence and citizenship, to recommit ourselves to a greater measure of devotion to family and country, and above all, to continue to pursue ways to provide for a more perfect  America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored and humbled by this opportunity to commemorate the life of SGT Nathan S. Barnes. He served his country with pride and answered its call when it needed him most. I will always remember him and his family in my prayers. Our nation owes SGT Nathan S. Barnes a giant debt of gratitude and for that reason I pay tribute today to his dedicated and selfless service to our Nation.</paragraph>
