    <bill type="hr" number="557">H. Res. 557</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas Article II of Chapter I of the United Nations Charter states that "[t]he Organization is based on the principles of sovereign equality of all its members"; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the former United Nations Human Rights Commission was widely discredited for its incessant attacks against Israel and for granting membership to Cuba, Zimbabwe, China, Saudi Arabia, and other countries that were notorious human rights violators;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to adopt a resolution establishing the United Nations Human Rights Council, stating that "members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the resolution also stated that "the Council shall be responsible for promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas China, Cuba, and Saudi Arabia are members of the United Nations Human Rights Council;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in the past year that the United Nations Human Rights Council has been in existence, the Council has held four special sessions to address pressing human rights situations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas of the four special sessions, three sessions were held for purposes of condemning Israel for alleged human right abuses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and in Lebanon, and the fourth session was a non-condemnatory expression of "concern" regarding the situation in Darfur, Sudan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council has failed to condemn serial abusers of human rights throughout the world, including Iran, Syria, North Korea, Cuba, China, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and others;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on June 19, 2007, a Department of State spokesperson specifically identified Burma, Cuba, North Korea, Zimbabwe, and Belarus as countries that merit consideration by the United Nations Human Rights Council due to their "serious human rights violations";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas during its fifth special session, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to make Israel the only country permanently included on its agenda; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon stated he was "disappointed at the Council's decision to single out only one specific regional item, given the range and scope of allegations of human rights violations throughout the world": Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) strongly condemns the United Nations Human Rights Council for ignoring severe human rights abuses in other countries, while choosing to unfairly target the State of Israel;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) strongly urges the United Nations Human Rights Council to remove Israel from its permanent agenda;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) strongly urges the United Nations Human Rights Council to hold special sessions to address other countries in which human rights abuses are being committed, adopt real reform as was intended for the Council when it replaced the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and reaffirm the principle of human dignity consistent with the original intent envisioned at the Council's establishment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) strongly urges the United States to make every effort in the United Nations General Assembly to ensure that the United Nations Human Rights Council lives up to its mission to protect human rights around the world, in accordance with United Nations General Assembly Resolution 60/251 establishing the Council; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) strongly urges the United States to work with the United Nations General Assembly to ensure that only countries that have a well-established commitment to protecting human rights are chosen to serve on the Council.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400379" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Representative Campbell for bringing this issue to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has long been my view that the United Nations can be, and in many cases is, a very, very useful organization. It gives the countries of the world a chance to come together in one place and discuss issues that they can work together on but, perhaps as importantly, to discuss their differences. It was set up so that, hopefully, that process would reduce more violent conflict, that they could discuss these issues, figure out a way to work together, and move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also feel that it is a very appropriate role of the United Nations to look throughout the world and see where injustice is being done, identify it, and try to fix it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, too many times that becomes politicized and focused, and in particular it becomes politicized and focused on the nation of Israel. With all of the problems that are going on throughout the world, all of the countries, all the despotic governments out there causing no ends of grief for their people, the one country that the United Nations continues to focus on is a free democracy in the Middle East, Israel. And they continually focus on them to the exclusion, in many cases, of far,  far greater problems in other parts of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, certainly I recognize the United Nations should be involved in the Middle East. There is unquestionably a conflict there between Israel and their neighbors in the Palestinian territories. Resolving that difference and helping the Palestinian people to set up their own country that will protect its people is incredibly important. But, again, unfortunately, the focus of the U.N. seems more to criticize and attack Israel to the exclusion of other problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank Mr. Campbell for bringing this resolution, which very simply asks, I guess, the United Nations to stop doing that, to stop focusing on Israel, and to have a broader focus on the problems of the world and do not unfairly criticize the nation of Israel. It undermines, rather than helps, any effort to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 557, introduced by my friend Congressman JOHN CAMPBELL of California and his Democratic coauthor also from California (Mr. Berman).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The activities of the United Nations Human Rights Council during its first year in operation has been a travesty, but it should not come as any surprise to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the summer the council, which embraces serious human rights abusers as members, celebrated its first birthday by giving gifts to repressive dictators and Islamic radicals. It stopped unfinished investigations into human rights conditions in Cuba and Belarus and created a permanent agenda item relating to Israel, the only country singled out for such scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darfur, apparently the Human Rights Council sees no problem in southern Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>North Korea, no evil there. China, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council, there are no human rights abusers in that workers' paradise. The bloody repression in Burma, in Zimbabwe, the council members have never heard of these actions. Unfortunately, these are exactly the consequences that many of us expected given the flaws inherent in the council's creation. For example, there are no criteria for membership in the council. Certain regional groups also are given greater power than democratic  countries. And special sessions are easier to call, with Israel being the target for condemnation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The council's structure and agenda are hopelessly compromised by political manipulation. The only country, again, singled out for actual condemnation has been the democratic State of Israel, which was the subject of three special sessions and 75 percent of all council resolutions and decisions expressing concerns about human rights conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, because of such outrages, the House adopted an amendment that I proposed to the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill which prohibited United States funding for the council. Mr. Campbell and Mr. Berman's resolution before us today presents this body with another important opportunity to protest the farce, the insult, the travesty, the sad joke that the U.N. Human Rights Council has become.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge unanimous support for its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400379" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time, and I thank my friend from California (Mr. Campbell) for coming to me with the idea of a resolution on the subject of the distorted, unfair, hypocritical, self-mocking agenda of the United Nations Human Rights Council and the need for the Congress of the United States to speak to their conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I thought that when the United Nations decided to create a human rights body to replace the thoroughly discredited Human Rights Commission, there might finally be a chance for an open, respected forum for promoting basic liberties and rights and holding countries accountable that failed to do so, rather than a body on which would be placed some of the worst human rights abusers in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission, as many of you know, was composed of many such countries whose own human rights records were far from laudable. While, for example, Zimbabwe, a former member of the commission, was busy leveling thousands of homes and leaving an estimated half a million people homeless, the commission was preoccupied with issuing successive reports condemning Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely hope that the council will live up to its charter and become an impartial and forceful proponent of human rights around the world. Unfortunately, some have argued that the council, by spending an inordinate amount of time vilifying Israel, is even worse than the commission. It has passed one-sided resolutions condemning Israeli human rights violations in the Palestinian territories, calling several extraordinary sessions on Israeli actions in Lebanon and Gaza, and appointed successive  rapporteurs to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Uzbekistan's jails continue to fill with thousands of prisoners, many of whom, according to the State Department, have been brutally tortured, the council was painfully silent. To be a human rights activist in Uzbekistan is to take one's life in one's own hands, yet the council has continued to shirk its responsibilities by failing to take a stand against these horrific human rights violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than taking the regime in Khartoum to task, as the gentlelady, the ranking member of the committee, pointed out, taking Khartoum to task for its brazen and continued support for the janjaweed militias in Darfur, widely acknowledged to be responsible for horrific crimes against Darfurian civilians, the council has issued only a tepid expression of concerns. This shameful record led The Washington Post to describe the council as a "ludicrous diplomatic lynch mob." Even U.N. Secretary General  Ban Ki Moon has publicly admonished the council's unwillingness to pursue an evenhanded human rights agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make clear the criticisms I level and others have leveled against the council should in no way be viewed as an indictment of all the work of the United Nations, much of which is indispensable and serves our national interest as well as global peace and security. And while it has not been without its share of mistakes, the U.N., through its countless peacekeeping operations, poverty alleviation efforts and disease prevention programs, has proven to be worth its weight in gold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We stand here today to criticize the Human Rights Council, which has an obsessed view of one country and only one country in terms of a human rights agenda, because we know that the U.N. can do better than they did in the creation and the rules governing that council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask you to support this resolution because I believe that, while the council is still in its infancy, we can work to maximize the chances that it develops into a respected and forceful champion of human rights, not simply another proxy in the vitriolic campaign against Israel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the author of this measure, the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from Washington for his support and supportive words about this bill. And most of all, I thank my coauthor in this effort, Mr. Berman, my friend and fellow Californian, for his involvement and effort in this bill and this important action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think it is an important action, Mr. Speaker, because, as the three previous speakers have mentioned, it's not like the world is devoid of problems in human rights. It's not like there are not repressive regimes in various places around the world. There is a place for the United Nations to be talking about this, to be dealing with this, to be trying to help this situation; but, unfortunately, this Human Rights Council, which was supposed to be that, is clearly not that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when this Human Rights Council was formed in 2006 to replace, as Mr. Berman pointed out, the discredited U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the then-U.N. General Assembly president, Jan Eliasson, said that the council would be "principled, effective and fair." And during its establishment, the U.N. General Assembly went on to say that this council would be responsible for "promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without  distinction of any kind, and in a fair and equal manner."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I applaud those words. I applaud the basis upon which this council was established. But the facts show that in the year of its existence, it has not followed this directive. As was pointed out, the first three special sessions out of the first nine sessions they had condemned Israel for their possible human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories and Lebanon. The fourth one was a noncondemnatory expression of concern regarding the situation in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what about Belarus? What about China? What about Cuba, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, anywhere else in the world? They have not even had a session to discuss them, not to mention have a mild condemnation or a full condemnation, but multiple condemnations of Israel, and they have now placed Israel on the permanent schedule. Now, that is not a good thing. That means that every meeting they have, they will be discussing what human rights violations are in Israel. But as Mr. Berman  pointed out, is Uzbekistan even on the calendar? No. Any of these other places even on the calendar? No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at some of the members of the Human Rights Council now. Some of the members include Algeria, China, Cuba, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Now, I'm very disappointed that, as it has happened, a group that started out with such a noble cause and noble effort seems to have a complete lack of reasoned objectivity with their obvious inherent discrimination against Israel. And it appears they have become a refuge for human rights abusers to hang out and thereby avoid scrutiny or condemnation  of their own actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this morning, the President was in New York speaking before the United Nations; and amongst the comments that he made was the following: "Yet the American people are disappointed by the failures of the Human Rights Council. This body has been silent on repression by regimes from Havana to Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing its criticism successively on Israel. To be credible on human rights in the world, the United Nations must reform its own Human Rights Council."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that's what this bill hopes to begin the process of doing. This Human Rights Council is a sham. It is not accomplishing what it was set out to do, yet the objective for which it was put in place still exists, the need still exists. The United Nations needs a real Human Rights Council, not a cover for those who would abuse human rights.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I rise in strong support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I was in front of the United Nations in demonstration of protesting Iranian President Ahmadinejad's speaking to the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always been a strong believer in the United Nations because I think that it is a good hope for world peace; but, frankly, I must say, the U.N. discredits itself, and it discredits itself once again by having this so-called Human Rights Council and the way it operates. And the U.N. really discredits itself by focusing so much hatred on one tiny little country, Israel. Whether it's in the General Assembly or the Security Council or the so-called Human Rights Council, Israel has become about  40 percent of the resolutions in the United Nations totally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's absolutely outrageous that you have countries like Algeria, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, even Egypt and Russia participating when Israel has such a better record of human rights than any of these countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem inherent with the United Nations, unfortunately, is you have dictatorships basically running the show. And we try to have a democratic institution, but it's inherently not, because it's dictatorships that are now a majority there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is outrageous, the Israel-bashing that goes on at the United Nations, and I am proud of this Congress for standing up and saying that enough is enough. People are dying in Darfur. We don't hear the Human Rights Council be so concerned about that as they are about bashing Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I strongly support this resolution. I think that the Congress does itself proud by bringing truth to the American people and to the world. And the Human Rights Council is no better than the organization that preceded it. We need to change it, otherwise the U.N. will continue to be discredited.</paragraph>
