  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I introduce the author of the legislation, I just want to say in introduction, unfortunately, suicide prevention has become a major part of our responsibilities to both active duty and our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a terrible statistic, Mr. Speaker, but as many Vietnam veterans have now committed suicide as died in the original war. That is over 58,000. We have to do as a Nation a better job. The Army just announced recently that the suicide rate among active duty and recently discharged has now reached Vietnam proportions. So we have to do a far better job and we intend to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The author of the original legislation, Mr. Boswell from Iowa, saw this very clearly and introduced this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the top priorities of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in this Congress is to address the needs of our returning servicemembers. The House passed <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, on March 21st of this year. I'm pleased the Senate also made it a priority to act on this important legislation. I believe the bill shows a clear compromise in our efforts to provide help to those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most pressing issues facing our men and women is mental health care. I believe that if we send our men and women off to war, we must, as a nation, do all we can to address their health care needs when they return. We cannot ask them to fight and then forget them when they return from battle. Veterans suffer a higher risk of suicide than the general population. The stress of combat, combined with the stigma that exists for servicemembers and veterans seeking mental health care services  can have disastrous consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do everything possible to improve the VA's mental health services, and its ability to detect, and help, those veterans most at risk. <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> will provide the important tools to assist the VA in strengthening suicide prevention, education, and awareness programs within the VA by mandating a comprehensive program for suicide prevention among veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague Mr. Boswell for introducing this bill, and I thank my colleagues for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a very important moment for our veterans as we think of their service to our country. Of course, we all wouldn't be here, I believe, I think we would agree with that, if it wasn't for our veterans, who have been willing to put it on the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Chairman Filner has spoken here, this legislation came up after a very tragic thing. Joshua Omvig, returning after an 11-month tour, a good young fellow, a member of the Grundy Center Volunteer Fire Department, the Grundy Center Police Reserves, he was concerned about the safety of others, but because of the situation, he took his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't help but be thoughtful of Ellen, his mother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>She would like to have had more training. She knew there was a problem, and so did his dad. She was with Josh when he went out to his pickup truck that day to go to work to try to talk to him, to try to help. And he took his life right in her presence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, they could have just kind of backed off in their great grief and sorrow and done nothing, but we reached out to them and they reached back. They want to participate in doing something for others. And so out of that came what is now known as <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>. It is pretty simple: Improve early detection for incidence of suicide among veterans, provide those veterans  with the assistance they need, which was not there for Joshua.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also requires the Veterans Administration to develop a comprehensive program to address the rate of suicide among veterans. And it also underscores the importance for further research, peer counseling, family education and involvement, and education for all staff at the Veterans Administration. There is an urgent need for this bill to pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have heard the report that Mr. Filner gave us. The statistics are astounding. Stress disorder has jumped like 70 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I want to thank our two Iowa Senators, Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley, for their support; and I especially want to thank Randy and Ellen Omvig, the mom and dad of Joshua. They have suffered a lot over this, as we all would. But at the same time, they found the courage and strength to want to help others and want to reach out. They want to do anything they can possibly do to prevent this from happening to another individual and another family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is almost with relief for me, Mr. Speaker, that we are passing this today and moving it on because we know there are hundreds of other veterans out there who need help, and this ought to set that in motion. There is no doubt there is more we can do, but this is a good beginning. With that, I would like to yield back and let other Members speak to this very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act as amended by the Senate. I also want to thank Mr. Boswell for his hard work in bringing this forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> was originally passed by the House unanimously in March. The legislation was slightly modified by the Senate to ensure that referrals for mental health counseling and treatment considered the request of the veteran concerned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preventing suicide among our veterans is a top priority of this Congress and the Nation. The Veterans Health Administration estimates there are 1,000 suicides per year among veterans receiving VA health care, and as many as 5,000 per year among all living veterans. These are alarming statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, as amended, establishes requirements for a multifaceted VA suicide prevention plan that strengthens early detection measures, staff education initiatives, and counseling and treatment assistance to reach out and help at-risk veterans to prevent suicides among those who have so bravely served our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>VA has already begun to implement a national suicide prevention lifeline as required by this legislation. The hotline became operational in July of this year. Veterans experiencing thoughts of suicide can call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) for help. The first call, according to the VA, was received on July 25. Since that time and through September 1, as a result of calls to the suicide prevention hotline, 346 callers were referred to a VA suicide prevention coordinator, and there were 56 rescues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, as amended, is important legislation that responds to the need to strengthen suicide prevention, education and awareness programs within the VA. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to the family of Joshua, both for their tireless efforts to pass this legislation and for their son's brave service to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too many soldiers are returning from the battlefield with hidden injuries. According to the Department of Defense, 60,000 troops have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries. Sadly, only a small number of our veterans receive or seek the help that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> strengthens cooperation between the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, it creates a comprehensive program to screen veterans for mental health and suicide risk factors, and increases training for suicide prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is the first step in ensuring that we treat the psychological wounds of our troops by improving mental health coordination and our outreach to veterans. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my overwhelming support for <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>. This bill addresses a glaring need for mental health support at the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medical personnel easily identify and treat physical injuries related to combat. However, more difficult to identify are those brave men and women that bear the mental scars of war. Posttraumatic stress disorder is a very real and potentially deadly condition if not properly treated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is we as a Nation ask a great deal of the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. They deal with extreme conditions, heavy body armor and separation from their families. In addition, these soldiers are constantly looking over their shoulders not knowing when or where the next attack or IED will come from. Many times, they witness firsthand the deaths of those they serve beside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under these extreme conditions, it is no wonder that those who have served so bravely come home and find it very difficult to put these experiences behind them. PTSD is gaining more attention, and rightly so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Veterans Affairs' Committee, we are seeing more servicemembers returning home with these types of stress disorders. If not properly treated, those suffering from PTSD may turn to drugs or alcohol to cope. Some may even take their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act is such an important piece of legislation. It ensures when a veteran is having trouble with any mental illness they have a place to turn. It ensures that at each VA medical facility there is a designated suicide prevention counselor who will engage in community outreach to veterans and improve the coordination of mental health services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also makes available mental health care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There is also a toll-free hotline for veterans staffed by appropriate mental health personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> provides a necessary service to our Nation's veterans, and I would urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400024" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman of the VA Committee for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. I listened to what Mr. Boswell had to say. He is the prime sponsor of the bill. I heard him in committee and I heard him again on the floor, and I appreciate so much the fact that he has brought this to Congress' attention. And a special thank you to Joshua's family and his parents. I am not sure if my child had committed suicide after his service in Iraq that I would have the strength to not only  go on as they have, but to try to bring PTSD to the attention of the American people and actually do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to share why this is important to me and why I am supporting this bill. More than 1,600 Nevada veterans have returned from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of these brave men and women suffer from PTSD. Nationally, one in five veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are suffering from PTSD; 35 percent have been diagnosed with some sort of mental disorder. It is vital that our veterans receive the help they need to deal with this condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years ago a constituent of mine, Lance Corporal Justin Bailey, returned from Iraq with some physical injuries as well as a diagnosis of PTSD. He struggled with addiction to legal prescription and illegal drugs. After consultation with his parents, he checked himself into the West L.A. VA facility where he was given five additional prescription drugs, including  methadone, without proper oversight. The next day, the man was dead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't understand, it is incomprehensible to me why a facility would give anyone with a substance abuse problem a 30-day supply of medication unsupervised under a self-medication policy. This devastating loss of life could have been and should have been prevented. This is a systemic problem in our VA system, and that's why this issue needs immediate attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One other quick story, if you can call it a story. About a month ago I called a grandmother in Pahrump, Nevada. It is a small town outside of Las Vegas. Her grandson lived with her. He came home from his first tour of duty in Iraq, and he was messed up mentally. He was suffering from PTSD. It was apparent to anybody who spoke to him. He didn't want to go back. He felt he couldn't handle it. He was emotionally and physically drained, and he begged not to go back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the military's response was they gave him Prozac because he was depressed and they sent him back to the front lines in Iraq. The day he got back to Iraq, he blew his brains out. That is a very difficult thing to come to grips with if you are the grandmother of a grandson who begged you not to let him go back to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have problems with PTSD. It is imperative that we provide adequate mental health services for those who have and are currently sacrificing for our great Nation. This bill takes a step in the right direction in providing our veterans with the health care they have earned.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Filner for his strong support of this piece of legislation and to all members of the committee. Mr. Boozman has been a strong supporter of our veterans, and I appreciate the support for this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Boswell so clearly illustrated the need for this piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to stand in support of this compromise that has come back from the Senate, and thank Senator Harkin for moving it towards us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I spoke on this piece of legislation in March, the numbers show that veterans' suicide and mental health issues are urgent issues that require Congress' immediate attention. Although veterans make up 10 percent of our population, one in five people who commits suicide in the United States is a veteran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A full 35 percent of our veterans returning from Iraq are seeking counseling for mental health issues within the first year. PTSD is fast becoming a signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Veterans' Affairs Committee has seen in countless hearings that the need to expand care is there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> will meet this need. By directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to offer mental health screening to veterans, providing education to VA staff, contractors and medical personnel, and making available 24-hour mental health care for veterans who are at risk, we will alleviate some of these hardships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation because of the critical service it will provide. Although we often have bitter debates in this House and are deeply divided over issues like the war in Iraq, there is one issue that we all agree on and has the potential to unite us and this Nation, and that is the care for our veterans. No one in this body questions the incredible sacrifice each of the veterans has made on behalf of the United States. And no one questions the responsibility that  we have in Congress to provide them with the resources and the help necessary to live healthy and prosperous lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation, the 110th Congress will again demonstrate its commitment on behalf of our veterans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to address this very important issue, and I want to congratulate and thank my colleague and friend, Congressman Boswell, for his persistence in seeing this bill to its conclusion and, again, thank the ranking member for the bipartisan support for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most moving experiences I've had in this body is standing on the floor when we first spoke about this bill and heard overwhelming support and great personal testimony from people on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to put a human face on the bill we are talking about. This is Joshua Omvig, and these are his parents, Randy and Ellen Omvig. I've known Randy and Ellen for almost 20 years. They're warm, caring, decent Iowans who loved their son and who are with us here in spirit as this bill makes its final journey through Congress on its way to the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joshua was a brave young man who served in a military police unit in Davenport, Iowa, which is in the First District that I happen to represent, and Joshua's face has become a national face for the issue and the crisis that brings us here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People who deal with post-traumatic stress disorder, especially PTSD involving veterans, will tell you this is the hidden combat wound. When these veterans return with PTSD, they can be walking on the streets of your city, your town, your community; and you will not know that they are suffering because of the nature of the disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's even more significant is that people suffering from PTSD are frequently the last people to know they've got a problem, and that's why this bill is so important, so that people coming back and veterans who are suffering from PTSD get the resources, the early screening and the early prevention and intervention necessary to make a difference in their lives and to save the next Joshua Omvig who faces this struggle without the necessary resources and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to be part of this overwhelming bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives to take care of our wounded veterans, our aging veterans, and our new veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. You've heard the statistics about the overwhelming nature of this problem among current combat veterans. That's why this bill is so important, and I ask my colleagues to join me today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this crucial legislation, introduced by my friend and colleague from Iowa, Congressman Boswell, and I am very pleased that the Senate has acted and that the House is again passing this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Named in honor of 22-year-old Joshua Omvig, an Army Reservist from Iowa who tragically took his own life after serving an 11-month tour of duty in Iraq, this legislation is an essential and overdue step in ensuring adequate mental health care for our troops who return home from serving in combat zones. The need for this legislation could not be more urgent, as more and more soldiers are returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from PTSD, TBI, and other combat-related mental health problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is very near to my heart, as I know Joshua's parents, Randy and Ellen Omvig, very well. It is my hope that the passage of this bill in the House today means that the tragic death of their son will not be in vain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Congressman Boswell for his leadership on this bill, and the Omvigs for their tremendous advocacy and commitment. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill today, and I urge President Bush to swiftly sign this bill into law so that we can give all of our returning veterans--who have sacrificed so much for our country--the mental health care and treatment that they deserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The incidence of suicide among our Nation's veterans is indeed staggering. In fact, it has reached the highest rate in 28 years, and we've already heard about Joshua Omvig, himself one of Iowa's own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By directing the VA to implement screening, counseling, and other mental health services for returning veterans, this legislation will reach those who are most in need of our help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the passage of this legislation, and I urge the President to quickly sign it into law so that these vital mental health services can reach our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Congressman Boswell for his hard work in bringing this forward, Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, Mr. Michaud, Mr. Miller, all of them for reaching a compromise with the Senate as we go forward on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a great example that out of a terrible tragedy something good can happen, and we've heard the story of this young guy, and because of his tragedy, because of that family's tragedy, hopefully in putting programs like this in place we will help other families, other individuals, other service men not go through this and prevent future tragedies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" and urge the President to sign this so that we can go forward completely.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Boswell for his ongoing support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation, in the name of Joshua Omvig and for his family and for all the families who have suffered from suicide, we have got to do a better job as a Nation. We have just got to do a better job. We know what will happen if we fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vietnam veterans have paid a heavy price for our refusal to look at mental health as important as physical health, for our refusal to look into the souls of our young veterans and recognize that they are crying out for help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have to get this right, and this is a good step in doing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Mr. Boswell and all the Iowa Representatives for taking a tragedy that befell Joshua Omvig and his family and turning it into a positive that will help all of us in America achieve better health care for our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. I first want to thank my friend and colleague Leonard Boswell for his service to our Nation, and his efforts to bring this legislation forward on behalf of Iowa veterans. I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation when it was introduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill contains many important provisions to ensure that the VA health system is better equipped to identify soldiers at risk for suicide and respond with appropriate counseling and care. The bill also mobilizes federal government agencies to pool their expertise on this issue in order to identify the best strategies for suicide prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is named in honor of SPC Joshua Omvig, who served his country as part of the Army Reserve 339th Military Police Company from Davenport, IA. A little over a year after his return from a tour in Iraq, Joshua Omvig took his own life on December 22, 2005. While his death was tragic, we are grateful for his service to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our soldiers encounter enormous stress and mental health challenges in the course of their duties. We have a crucial obligation to do all we can to ensure that our veterans are given proper care and to prevent such tragedies from occurring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one has done more to secure our Nation's freedom than our veterans and military personnel. Their sacrifice and service must be matched with greater commitment to them on our part. With that, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. As our soldiers continue to defend our country's freedom overseas, it is imperative that we at home continue to recognize their sacrifice by providing them with the support and services that they have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> is named after an Iraq veteran Joshua Omvig, a 22-year-old Army Reservist who served honorably in Iraq, but returned home unable to cope with his memories of the war. Only months after his return from Iraq, he committed suicide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story of Joshua Omvig is not an isolated occurrence. In 2004, a study conducted by the New England Study of Medicine concluded that over 15 percent of veterans returning from a year in Iraq met screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Today, our soldiers are serving much longer than a single year and are returning from combat with severe psychological trauma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> implements a comprehensive program that takes into consideration the special needs of veterans who are at high risk of depression and experience high rates of suicide. By directing and training the staff of Veterans Affairs in the proper screening, monitoring, and tracking of veterans, this legislation will lead to earlier diagnosis for those who may be prone to suicide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility to support our Nation's veterans. I stand in strong support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the measures in this bill are designed to reduce the alarming incidence of suicides among our vets. According to a recent study conducted by Portland State University, male U.S. military veterans are twice as likely to commit suicide as men who haven't served in the armed forces. The report is a painful reminder of why we must adopt the measures outlined in this bill to assist our military personnel returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Portland State study followed 320,000 men over age 18 for 12 years collecting data on those who participated in the National Health Interview Survey. The researchers found that men who had served in the military at some time between 1917 and 1994 were twice as likely to die from suicide than men in the general population. In addition, veterans who committed suicide were more likely to be older, white, better educated, and married. But the report offered few clear indicators for the high suicide  rates. That in part is the purpose of this legislation--to locate the root cause of the high suicide rates and to reverse the situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are approximately 25 million veterans in the United States, and 5 million veterans who receive care within the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA). Based on CDC data, VHA mental health officials estimate 1000 suicides per year among veterans receiving care with VHA and as many as 5000 per year among all living veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Boswell's bill is a bipartisan effort to get at the root of this troubling trend and to find solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill requires the Veterans Administration to consider the special needs of veterans who suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and mandates the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence of suicide among all veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill accomplishes this by requiring that appropriate Veterans Administration staff are able to recognize risk factors for suicide and are aware of the proper protocols and best practices for responding to crisis situations involving veterans who may be at high risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also requires the designation of a suicide prevention counselor at each department medical facility and authorizes the availability of 24-hour mental health care; a hotline, staffed with trained mental health personnel; and expanded outreach and education services for veterans and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must put an end to this tragedy affecting the many vulnerable men and women who have worn our country's uniform and who serve this country proudly today. I believe this legislation is an important step in that direction, and I am happy to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill>, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, which will expand suicide-prevention services to our nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joshua Omvig was an Army Reservist who committed suicide in 2005 after serving his  Nation in Iraq. My thoughts and prayers are with the family of this fallen hero, who have responded to this tragedy by championing efforts to improve mental health care for returning war veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is widely understood that suicide among veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and pressing problem facing our veterans' community. Our Nation's men and women returning from service abroad deserve the highest quality care that this Nation can provide, including access to top quality mental health programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="327">H.R. 327</bill> directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to take a comprehensive approach to combating the negative long-term effects of PTSD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this Act requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop a program that includes screening for suicide risk factors for veterans receiving medical care at all Department facilities, referral services for at-risk veterans for counseling and treatment, designation of a suicide prevention counselor at each Department facility, a 24-hour veterans' mental health care availability, peer support counseling, and mental health counseling program for veterans who have experienced sexual  trauma while in military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure to improve suicide-prevention programs through the Department of Veterans Affairs. I commend the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for their hard work on this bill.</paragraph>
