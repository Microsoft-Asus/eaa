  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is easy to tell where President Bush's priorities lie when you look at his proposed fiscal year 2008 budget. It is with big business and the wealthiest 1 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposed budget is fiscally irresponsible, creating trillions of dollars in new deficit, but it is also morally irresponsible for slashing funding for Medicare, education, energy, homeland security and veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget slashes Medicare and Medicaid funding by about $300 billion over the next 10 years, without offering relief to millions of Americans without health insurance. The Bush budget also cuts funds for renewable energy grants, despite his State of the Union pledge to tackle our Nation's energy crisis. He even reduces State homeland security preparedness grants. Perhaps worst of all, the Bush budget cuts veterans health care by $3.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats will put the needs of working families first in our budget in the coming weeks.</paragraph>
