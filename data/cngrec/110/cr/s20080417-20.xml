  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="TRIBUTE TO HARVEY WHITE WOMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President. I wish to recognize a distinguished member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Harvey White Woman. Harvey passed away on Monday, March 31, 2008 following a brave battle against a rare form of cancer. Though he was only 44, he carried the wisdom and insight of many elders and worked in a positive way to educate native and nonnative people on treaty and water rights. He was often asked to give presentations to adults and schoolchildren alike about the Fort Laramie Treaty of  1868 as a way to educate the public, not only about the history of this region of our country but also about the promises that were made to native people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his work as an assistant to the Oglala Sioux Tribe's Fifth Member's office, Harvey's voice could be heard reminding us as Members of Congress of our duties to uphold those treaty obligations. He also served on the board of the Lakota Fund in Kyle and most recently as the first director of the Wawokiye Business Institute. The Wawokiye Institute gives specialized assistance to entrepreneurs who are working toward realizing their goal of business success. Through his work and presentations on  traditional entrepreneurship, many people around the world gained a better understanding of the business instincts of native people throughout history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harvey also led the newly formed Oglala Lakota Cancer Survivors, Inc., on Pine Ridge, which is an effort to bring together those survivors and their families to talk about cancer and the unique circumstances that native people face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harvey was taken from us too soon. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to his family and his friends in this time of great loss and encourage them to go forward with Harvey's efforts.</paragraph>
