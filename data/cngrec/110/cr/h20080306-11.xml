    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last weekend I was honored to travel with a delegation to visit our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am grateful to report that I saw significant success while walking the market district of Haditha in Anbar province, Iraq, to driving across Asadabad, Afghanistan, to see a new bridge under construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violence in Iraq has declined by over 60 percent since the beginning of the surge. In Afghanistan I appreciate the success of the 218th Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard, led by Brigadier General Bob Livingston, to train Afghani forces to secure their own homeland. The best way to protect American families at home is to stop terrorists overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many challenges we face both in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the brave men and women fighting on the front lines have done everything we have asked of them. So let's do what they have asked of us. Let them complete the mission, protecting American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
