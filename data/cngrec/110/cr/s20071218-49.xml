    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to an outstanding friend and advisor, Wally Rustad, who will be concluding his time as chief of staff on January 10, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July 2007, when my longtime chief of staff announced his intention to retire, Wally agreed to come out of retirement to serve as interim chief of staff during the transition period. Wally was no stranger to my office. Following a long career working for the National Rural Electric Cooperatives, he served as my state liaison for 6 years. In fact, Wally and I have a history of working together that spans back over 40 years when I was an intern in the office of Congressman Rolland Redlin and  he was serving as the young chief of staff for the Congressman. Wally and I have been working together in one form or another ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wally came on board as my interim chief of staff and immediately provided the steady leadership that is crucial during times of change. During his tenure in my office, Wally has done an outstanding job of seeing my staff through personnel changes and legislative challenges, and has provided me the steady advice of a seasoned veteran. His work has been outstanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, and most importantly, Wally Rustad is an outstanding person. He has never forgotten the small-town values he learned growing up Grenora, ND. He has worked quietly and tirelessly behind the scenes to make things happen and was always happy to divert credit to others. He has been tremendously loyal, dedicated, and a passionate advocate for the people of my State. He has never forgotten that he is working for the American taxpayer. And he has been a good friend and a mentor to others on  staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With extraordinary gratitude for his time serving as my chief of staff, I wish Wally well as he returns home to his lovely wife Marlys. I have been blessed to have Wally as a trusted advisor and confidante but most importantly he has been a great friend. I wish him all the best as he returns to retirement and look forward to continuing our association for many years to come.</paragraph>
