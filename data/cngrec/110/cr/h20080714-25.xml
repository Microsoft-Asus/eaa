    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution, introduced by Bob Filner of California, chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, is both appropriate and timely. It expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that American flags flown on Federal Government buildings and on Federal property should be made in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with many basic products sold in the U.S. today, it can be difficult to find a flag that is made in America. But the American flag is not just any product. It is our national symbol, and especially when it flies over Federal Government property, it ought to be made in America by Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the Architect of the Capitol flies only American-made flags. When one of our constituents or a community organization receives a flag flown over the Capitol, they can be sure it was made in the U.S.A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we see the American flag, it should remind us of American workers whose jobs are sometimes now being shipped overseas to countries with lower labor and worker safety protections. The American flag represents the values of our Nation, values that cannot be reconciled with the conditions in many overseas factories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot we need to do to ensure that America retains the jobs that drive our economy. But as one step, if only a small symbolic step, let us assure the American people that we will not fly imported American flags over Federal property. The flags we fly will be made by American workers in American factories. They will never be made in foreign sweatshops or by children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. And I want to commend the gentleman from California for introducing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from California, and I do rise in support of House Resolution 1182, a sense of Congress that U.S. flags flown over Federal buildings should be made in the good old U.S.A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The flag represents our unity and strength to the rest of the world, and it is only fitting that U.S. flags flown over Federal buildings be a product of our own country's labor and resources. Americans produce the best in the world when they put their minds to it, and it is entirely appropriate that the flag staffs on our Federal buildings be reserved for the best in the world, made right here in America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Speaker and Chairman Conyers for bringing <bill type="hr" number="1182">H. Res. 1182</bill> to the floor today. This important resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that all American flags flown over Federal Government buildings and on  Federal property should be made in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Census bureau estimates that $5.3 million worth of American flags were imported from other countries in 2006, mostly from China. Even though U.S. law requires every flag be labeled with its "country of origin," the figure of foreign-made American flags has steadily grown over the past few years. This is an absolute shame! I am glad that the office of the Architect of the Capitol has reassured me that flags that we fly everyday over this very Capitol are proudly made in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrated Independence Day last week, we were reminded that the American flag is much more than our national symbol. It embodies our courage, liberty, and justice. The flag reminds us each and every day of the blood that was shed so that we may enjoy our freedoms. So as we proudly fly the Stars and Stripes, we must ensure that they are homespun in the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="hr" number="1182">H. Res. 1182</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="1182">H. Res. 1182</bill> introduced by my distinguished colleague from California, Representative Filner. This important legislation seeks to express the sense of the House of Representatives that American flags flown on Federal Government buildings and on Federal property be made in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 14, 1777, the Stars and Stripes were officially adopted as the national flag of the United States. Francis Scott Key was so inspired by the sight of the American flag still flying over Baltimore's Fort McHenry after a British bombardment that he wrote the "Star-Spangled Banner" on September 14, 1814. The American flag has 7 red and 6 white horizontal stripes; these stripes represent the 13 original States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The flag still has its field of blue, which represents the Union and contains 50 stars, one for each State. Many brave men and women have fought and died for the freedom that this flag represents. The sight of this banner brings feelings of joy, courage, pride, and unity for all Americans. Therefore, it should be the sense of the United States House of Representatives that all American flags flown over Federal buildings be entirely produced in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the symbol of our Nation's strength and unity. It's been a source of pride and inspiration for millions of citizens. And the American Flag has been a prominent icon in our national history. On June 14, 1777, in order to establish an official flag for the new Nation, the Continental Congress passed the first Flag Act, "resolved that the flag of the United States be made of thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be thirteen  stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 1777 and 1960, Congress passed several acts that changed the shape, design and arrangement of the flag and allowed for additional stars and stripes to be added to reflect the admission of each new state. Executive Order of President Eisenhower dated January 3, 1959--provided for the arrangement of the stars in seven rows of seven stars each, staggered horizontally and vertically. Executive Order of President Eisenhower dated August 21, 1959--provided for the arrangement of the stars in  nine rows of stars staggered horizontally and eleven rows of stars staggered vertically which made official the design of the flag that we know today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, we should not reserve the right to make our Nation's flag at home, where blood was shed by brave men who had a vision for a free country rooted in democracy and justice. Although we may outsource many things, I support that we preserve the integrity of the symbol that serves as the very essence of our national anthem. This anthem serves to remind us of the United States flag, also known as the Star-Spangled Banner, which waves over the land of the free and the home of the brave. When  we rise to pledge allegiance to our country, we place our hand over our beating heart; then we sing the delicate notes of the Star-Spangled Banner, but most of all we fix our gaze upon our Nation's flag. This time of reverence serves as a moment of introspection. Not until we fully come to grips with ourselves can we apply the wisdom that is needed to gather solutions for international issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation was founded upon the principles of liberty, equality and justice, which are reflected by the symbol of our Nation's flag. Therefore, I strongly support this powerful resolution that says that flags flown on Federal Government buildings and on Federal property be made in the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
