    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is a serious day on Capitol Hill. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have returned. They are reporting to the Nation on the progress in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since they were last here, this is what the Iraqi Parliament has passed: A pension law for regime officials; de-Baathification reform; an amnesty law; a provincial election law. The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces; sectarian killings are down 90 percent; civilian deaths have dropped by more than 70 percent; and coalition casualties have dropped by more than 70 percent. Most importantly, Iraqi security forces are fighting for the future of their very own country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some in this House are so invested in the narrative of defeat that they are blind to the results of a campaign that ranks among the greatest in the history of our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops have achieved tremendous success through valor and sacrifice. Let's not sell them out and choose to lose a winnable war. History would not forgive us for that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
