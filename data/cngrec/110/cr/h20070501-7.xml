    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in tribute to Corporal Nick Polizzotto, 9-year veteran of the South Bend Police Department who gave his life in the line of duty. For the people of South Bend, Indiana, Corporal Polizzotto is our hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 24th, 2007, a report of gunshots brought Corporal Polizzotto and his partner, Patrolman Michael Norby, to a local motel. There at 1:37 a.m. an armed suspect shot both policemen, killing Corporal Polizzotto and wounding Patrolman Norby. Patrolman Norby credits Corporal Polizzotto with saving his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our community has lost a beloved family member, a generous friend, a devoted father, and a dedicated protector. Often described as having a heart of gold, he proudly wore his uniform and bravely patrolled the streets of our city until making the ultimate sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in South Bend, Nick always wanted to be a police officer. During his many years as a South Bend officer, he received 18 commendations and was officer of the month in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Polizzotto leaves behind his parents, his wonderful son Joe and Joe's mom Michelle, a brother Tony, a sister Amy and countless relatives and friends who loved him. South Bend has lost a brave guardian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we grieve for our hero, Corporal Nick Polizzotto. May God welcome him home and give comfort to his family and friends.</paragraph>
