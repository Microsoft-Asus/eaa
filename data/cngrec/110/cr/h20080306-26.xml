  <narrative>U.S.-COLOMBIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1400]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after thousands of kidnappings and murders inside Colombia carried out by the terrorist organization known by its initials as FARC, Colombia finally had enough. And when it learned that key heads of the terrorist group that were being given sanctuary inside Ecuador by the government of that country, when Colombia learned that the terrorists were 1,800 meters from Colombia, Colombia decided to strike. It did so from Colombian airspace. And, in fact,  the FARC shot at the Colombian Air Force, which permitted the Colombian Air Force to pinpoint the exact spot where the FARC terrorists were, where they had been, and from where they were attacking Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colombia struck, and the second-ranking FARC terrorist head, Luis Edgar Devia-Silva, alias Raul Reyes, was killed. Reyes was killed along with approximately 20 other terrorists. Unfortunately, one brave Colombian soldier fighting in defense of freedom, Carlos Hernandez Leon, was also killed during the operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is as tragic as it is condemnable. It is, in fact, criminal for the Governments of Ecuador and Venezuela to provide sanctuary for terrorists who systemically commit murder and kidnappings inside Colombia, and then those terrorists return to Venezuelan and Ecuadorian soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush and the United States of America have stood by and are firmly standing by our great democratic ally and friend Colombia and its twice overwhelmingly elected President Alvaro Uribe. Unfortunately, that is not the case with much of the rest of our hemisphere. I commend President Bush for his steadfast support of our great ally President Uribe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, it is time for this Congress to act. We need to renew and to increase our security aid to Colombia, which has been known for a decade as Plan Colombia, and the majority leadership of this Congress must immediately schedule a vote on U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, an agreement that is in the interest both of the American and the Colombian peoples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leadership of this House must stop preventing a vote on the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The position on that critical issue of the majority leadership of this Congress is petty and is ultimately irresponsible. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee was quoted recently as saying, referring to trips that Members of Congress have been taking to Colombia to find out for themselves how the Free Trade Agreement would affect our two countries: "It is not the facts on  the ground that are important; it is the politics in the air." How sad, Mr. Speaker. How sad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for this Congress to send a clear sign of support and solidarity to our good friend Colombia. It is time to stop blocking the FTA with Colombia and for the majority leadership of Congress to schedule a vote on the Free Trade Agreement with Colombia now.</paragraph>
