  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 13-15, the residents of Petersburg will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Petersburg is a vibrant community in the northeastern part of North Dakota, not far from Grand Forks Air Force Base. Petersburg holds an important place in North Dakota's history. Founded by Levi Peterson and Martin N. Johnson, the name of the community was determined by a coin toss. Peterson won the coin toss and declared the city name Petersburg in honor of his birthplace in Petersborg, Norway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Petersburg is a farming community with an assortment of clubs. Some of these organizations like the Sons of Norway, Red River Valley Scandinavian Singers Association, and the Norwegian Singers and Association of America are keeping the region's Scandinavian culture alive. Petersburg also takes much pride in its curling club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who call Petersburg home, it is a comfortable place to live, work, and play. The community has planned an exciting 125th anniversary weekend. There will be a parade, food, bands, dancing, a craft show, flea market, magicians, games, an all school reunion, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the U.S. Senate to join in me congratulating Petersburg, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and wishing them well in the future. By honoring Petersburg and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Petersburg that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Petersburg has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
