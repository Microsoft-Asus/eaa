  <narrative>PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13225]</narrative>
  <chair> The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings).</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would inquire of my friend from Florida if she has any more speakers on her side.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm the last Member to speak on my side. So I will reserve the balance of my time until my colleague from Washington has made his closing remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I find that we are debating a rule that is rather ironic because the underlying bill that this rule would make in order is a bill about discrimination and ending discrimination, and yet the very rule, the very rule that we are debating, which makes three  amendments in order, is a discriminatory rule because it does not treat all three amendments equal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned in my opening statement, Mr. Speaker, I will be calling for a vote on the previous question, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, by voting "no" on the previous question, Members will show their support for having a vote on amendment No. 3, which would expand the bill's protections to persons discriminated against based on gender identity. This is defined in the amendment as the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms, or other characteristics of an individual with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, those voting "no" on the previous question will be able to vote on this question. Those Members who vote "yes" on the previous question will be showing their support for denying Americans, through their representatives, a voice on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, if the previous question is defeated, I will amend the rule by striking that provision in the language that denies having to seek unanimous consent to offer to withdraw the vote. If the previous question is defeated, the House will still be able to consider the employment nondiscrimination bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, this rule, as it stands, discriminates against amendments made in order. My colleagues who entered into the debate today said they are against discrimination; therefore, I urge them to vote "no" on the previous question and for equality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before the House today is the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 and the rule for debate. This bipartisan legislation from the people's House, the House of Representatives, marks another important step towards equality for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, during the 230-plus-year history of our great country, the march toward equality under the law for all citizens has sometimes been slow, but it has been steady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over time, this Congress has outlawed discrimination in the workplace based upon a person's race, gender, age, national origin, religion and disability. When it comes to employment and hiring and firing and compensation and promotion, these decisions are rightly based upon a person's qualifications and job performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill today will extend civil rights protections to sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>On this proud day of the 110th Congress, we will chart a new direction for civil rights. On this proud day, the Congress will act to ensure that all Americans are granted equal civil rights in the workplace. The underlying value of Americans everywhere is to be treated fairly in our jobs and workplaces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this hopeful day for America, we will stand up for citizens who previously lived in fear that they will lose their jobs due to their employers' prejudices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on this landmark civil rights act. I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in 31 states, it is still legal to fire someone because that person is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In 39 states, it is legal to do so if the person is transgender. I am proud that Vermont already protects individuals against employment discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity. Vermont's 1992 Human Rights Law included sexual orientation protections in public and private employment, as well as public accommodations, education, housing, credit, insurance  and union practices. In May of this year, Vermont included gender identity protections in employment, public accommodations, and housing. I applaud Vermont for these important steps and we must do the same on the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When making employment decisions, employers should look at an individual's qualifications and the quality of the work they produce, not their sexual orientation or gender identity. The public strongly supports this notion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many employers have already acted on their own. Approximately 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies include sexual orientation in their nondiscrimination policies. More specifically, 49 of the Fortune 50 companies have a policy against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Progress is being made on the gender identity front as well. Approximately 25 percent of Fortune 500 companies include protections against gender identity discrimination in their corporate policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where employers do not act, however, the Federal government must step in and extend this protection to employees across the country. Employees are currently protected from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin or disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If not enacted today, I believe this Congress will soon realize that gender identity protections, like in Vermont, are also necessary and I stand ready to join my colleagues in taking that next step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decision before us today is whether or not we take a giant step forward. Whether or not we as a Congress want to protect the millions of gays and lesbians across the country from employment discrimination. This legislation is a perfect example of how this Congress has made a commitment to a new direction. This new direction embodies the values of equality and fairness, making sure that workers, children, families, and communities can fully participate in the successes of our economy. This  bill would have never seen the light of day in past Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad that the rule makes in order the amendment by Representative Baldwin to include "gender identity" protections in the bill. I urge all my colleagues to support the rule, support the Baldwin amendment, and support the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings of Washington is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="793">H. Res. 793</bill> Offered by Mr. Hastings of Washington</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In section 1 of the resolution, strike the sentence which begins "Amendment number 3 in the report of the Committee on Rules".</paragraph>

  <narrative>(The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress.)</narrative>
  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ..... [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal  to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts  to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative>Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
