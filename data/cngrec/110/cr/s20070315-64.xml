    <paragraph>Mr. President, this week has been a week full of a lot of work, a lot of surprises but a lot of results. We finished the 9/11 bill, which is something the Senate should feel very good about. We did that on a bipartisan basis with the leadership of Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we completed a 2-day debate on Iraq. It was a good, civil debate. Both the majority and minority issued their statements. I thought they did them well. We were able to have some votes. I think it was something that brought dignity to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had three judicial nominations approved--two district court judges, one circuit court judge. We are doing our level best to not have any problems with judicial nominations. The President is doing his share of helping us with this by sending us some good people. We have had agreement on the U.S. attorney bill that has been done with bipartisan support. This is set up for debate starting Monday. We will complete that on Tuesday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, finally, again, using the Lieberman-Collins example, the chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad and Senator Judd Gregg, did a wonderful job. There is not a more contentious issue that comes before this body than the budget. All 100 Members believe they can do a better job than either Judd Gregg or Kent Conrad can do, but they have the responsibility of coming up with the budget. They worked together for a number of years. They are friends and they set  a good example. This matter was completed by 3:30 this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week is going to be a tough week. There will be a lot of amendments offered, and we look forward to that. But we have a statutory way of proceeding through this. Whoever drew the statute probably had too much to drink the night before. But at least that is the statute we have. It is 50 hours, and unlimited amendments can be offered. But at least we know what we are up against next week because we have done it many times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, this closely divided Senate, at this stage during the final weeks of Senator Johnson's incapacitation, is 50 to 49. He will be back with us soon. But even then, it is 51 to 49. It is a very closely divided Senate, and we are getting work done recognizing that there can be no bullies in the Senate, that we have to work together to get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have accomplished a lot this week. All 100 Senators deserve a pat on the back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is no further business to come before the Senate today, I would turn to the Republican leader to see if he has comments before we adjourn.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would only add my own sentiment with regard to next week. It will be a challenging week; budget week always is. For those who are interested in offering amendments, obviously the earlier in the week, the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader and I have talked about the challenges associated with the so-called vote-arama that occurs at the end of the budget debate every year, which is frustrating to both sides. Some have thought it mutually assured destruction in terms of morale. The only way to have any real impact on that obviously is for Members to offer their amendments earlier in the week, hopefully to be allowed votes earlier in the week, thereby minimizing the multiplicity of votes that frequently occur--in  fact, always occur--at the end of a budget resolution when the time expires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to a challenging week and will see all of our Members next week.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I say to my friend, being the great fan of basketball that he is, I thought he would note that Louisville won the first game today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the majority leader noting that Louisville won the game today. I might say to my good friend, it is on the DVR, and I expect to watch it at home tonight. I note that UNLV and URI will play tomorrow.</paragraph>
