    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will hear the State of the Union address from the President, and one of the issues that he will highlight in his speech tomorrow night is the need for expanded health care for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something that the Republicans in Congress have focused on for several years, and it is with excitement that we anticipate the President's remarks tomorrow night as he talks about small business health care, talks about small business health plans and how expanding small business health plans to 40 million uninsured Americans, 60 percent of whom work in small businesses, will help more and more families to be able to control their health care and their health care expense, their health  care decisions, and preserve their right to access to physicians of their choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that by giving small businesses the opportunity to band together, they will have greater options. And we know that this will reduce the number of uninsured Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to the President's plan for expanding health care through small business health plans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
