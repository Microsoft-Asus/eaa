    <paragraph>Mr. President, I see my friend, Senator Chambliss, is on the floor. I think we are both very frustrated. I don't think, I know we are both very frustrated that we are stymied on this farm bill. We are not moving anywhere. But in hopes that maybe we can get something moving, I am going to propound some unanimous consent requests to see if we can't break out and move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I inquire of my colleague, Senator Chambliss, as to whether we can agree to a time limitation for debate with respect to the pending Dorgan-Grassley amendment. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that there be 60 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment No. 3508, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendment; that no second-degree amendment be in order  prior to the vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am certain the Senator will have another unanimous consent request of his own very shortly, as he just enunciated. I just proposed five requests for votes in relation to amendments that are relevant to the farm bill. As we just heard, there are objections to each one of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are ready to move ahead. We have been here now a week, over a week, on this farm bill, and we are stuck, dead in the water. Again, my friend, Senator Chambliss, said he wanted to send to the desk a list of amendments that have been looked at. Not all of them have been filed, as I understand, but they have been talked about. As I understand it, there are 255 amendments. That is ridiculous. Of course, we are not going to have 255 amendments. But at least we could work. We are here;  we could be working now. We could debate the Dorgan amendment and vote on it today. There are five requests I just offered right now, five amendments we could dispose of this afternoon. The other side objected to each one of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I am extremely frustrated, as the chairman of the committee. We got a bill through. We worked very hard on it. Senator Chambliss worked very hard on it. Yet we are stuck. We got it through committee. There was not one dissenting vote in the committee, not one. It is a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Lincoln said--I heard her speech this morning--it is bipartisan, it is multiregional. There are a lot of compromises in it, as is true in any bill. But we got it through without a dissenting vote. Yet we cannot even work on it on the Senate floor? We cannot even work on it. Forget about passing it, we can't even work on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just propounded five requests to have debate and votes on amendments, relevant amendments to this farm bill, and every time it was objected to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know. I just want to make it clear that we on this side are ready to do business. We have been for a week. We could have been debating relevant amendments. We could have almost--we could have been done with this bill by now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out a little bit of history. On the last farm bill, when I was privileged to chair the committee at that time in the Senate, in 2002, we had 10 days of consideration in December and 6 days in February. That was it. Mr. President, 53 amendments were considered, not 255.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, we had 4 days of consideration, 24 amendments to the bill; in 1990, 7 days of consideration, and we proceeded to vote on it. This is very frustrating. We are here. We are ready to do business. We are ready to debate and vote. Yet the leadership on the other side says no. The leadership says no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to make it clear, fundamentally, basically clear to all Senators and anyone watching: We on this side have been ready, are ready, are willing to debate and vote on these amendments. It has been objected to on the other side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is almost unbelievably disappointing. This is the second week we are on the farm bill. We have people in the Senate who believe, apparently, they are trying to imitate a set of human brake pads and stop everything. We haven't even started. How can you stop it? I don't understand this at all. If family farmers farmed like Congress legislated, there would be no food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes spring you have to plant the seeds. You have to do it. It is not an option. When it comes harvest time, you have to take it off the field. When the cows are ready to milk, you have to milk. We have a few people in Congress who believe you don't have to do anything. All you have to do, as I said, is imitate a set of human brake pads and just stop everything. I guess maybe that is a successful strategy for some, if you do not believe anything ought to get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of this committee, Senator Harkin, and the ranking member, Senator Chambliss, worked hard on this. I understand Senator Chambliss has been objecting as a result of the minority leader's position. I understand that. But my colleague from Iowa just propounded a series of unanimous consent requests. He said let's just start. This isn't rocket science. How do you get this bill done? First, you start the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand it, my colleague proposed a couple of amendments from each side, Democratic amendments, Republican amendments. Just start,  have some time agreements, have a debate, have a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there are some who do not want a farm bill to be passed in this Congress, I understand. They have a right to vote against and speak against the farm bill. But why on Earth should they hold this bill hostage to their whims? We take for granted, every single day in this country, what family farmers do. They get up out there in the country, living under a yard light, get up, often very early, and do chores. They work hard. They take a lot of risks. They have big dreams. They live on hope. They  must live on hope. They hope there is going to be a better crop, a better year. They hope they are going to be able to make a decent living. We take all of that for granted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we try to do in the Congress is to write a farm bill that says family farmers are important--yes, for economic reasons but also for cultural reasons, to have a network of families out there producing America's food. Family farmers are important, and we understand families can't survive some tough times, so we create a safety net, a bridge over price depressions. And we say: We want to help you. That is what the farm bill is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other pieces of it, nutrition and other issues, but the centerpiece of a safety net for family farmers is very important. I guess I don't remember a time when we had a farm bill on the Senate floor that has been held up. I voted against some farm bills I didn't like. But, you know, I didn't like the so-called Freedom to Farm bill, which I thought was a disaster, so I voted against it, but I didn't come down to the floor to try to prevent it from moving. I just said this is something  I will not support, so I voted against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, and in the previous case with the farm bill we operate under currently, I support it. I really  want this to move forward. I do not understand. I do not understand at all. We could compare, perhaps, the Senate to a glacier, but the difference is a glacier actually moves from time to time. This Senate, on this bill, is going nowhere because of a couple of people who decided we are going to stop it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader has brought this bill to the floor of the Senate, allowed 2 weeks for it. Both colleagues, Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss, have worked hard. My colleague, Senator Conrad, has been out here working hard to see if can we get a list of amendments we can begin working through. Apparently, we now know there are something like 250 amendments that have been noticed. Obviously, we are not going to have 250 amendments on this bill. We don't have time  for that. Some of these amendments, a good many of them, have nothing at all to do with this subject at all--going back into immigration and a whole series of tax issues that have nothing to do with farming, agriculture, family farms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the question is, Can we find a way to reduce that number of amendments and then just start?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first amendment Senator Grassley and I have offered is an amendment that would, I think, improve the bill. But we have not been able to even begin the first 5 minutes of debate on that amendment. There are many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague offers a proposal: Let's at least start on two Republican and two Democratic amendments. The first step of any journey is the most important step. Let's just begin. Here it is, a week and a half after the bill comes to the floor of the Senate, and this Senate is at parade rest. I do not understand it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my great concerns at the moment is that the time has been set aside to try to get this farm bill done. Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss wrote a farm bill that came out of the Agriculture Committee, as I understand, unanimously. You would believe, then, that represents bipartisan agreement on the central portion of a farm bill. Can we improve it a little bit? I think so. There are some amendments back and forth that perhaps will improve some portions of it. But the  fact is, they wrote a bipartisan bill that had very strong support, in fact, unanimous support in the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How on Earth do we get to a point where a bill that comes out of the committee unanimously, a bill that is as important as this one is to every region of the country, sits on the floor of the Senate at parade rest, and we cannot even get to debate on the first amendment? I do not understand that at all. That makes no sense to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, time is running out. I worry if we do not get this bill done this week--work late tonight, late tomorrow night, into Friday, get this bill done--I worry that this bill is not going to get done in any timely fashion. What an awful message for us to send to family farmers. The message in this bill is, we think they matter. We think they are an important part of this country's economic strength. Family farmers have always been the economic All-Stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is beyond me to understand what is going on here. We have amendments. My amendment is pending, but we can't even begin the first minute of debate. I don't understand it at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said before on the floor of the Senate that family farmers in this country produce a lot more than crops and food. They produce communities. They are the blood vessels that create the strength for these small towns. I grew up in one of those towns. We raised some cattle and some horses. The fact is, family farmers are very important to the economic strength and to the culture of this country. They do not expect much. They don't ask for much. They are an independent bunch of people. They  are people who try to raise a family and raise a crop, way out in the country, in many cases. They are not asking for anything very much except that this country has believed for a long while that all of the uncertainties, all of the risks that accrue to family farming in many cases just wipe them out unless you have some kind of safety net. That is why we have created a safety net.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They plant a seed, hope it grows, hope it rains enough, hope it doesn't rain too much, hope it doesn't hail, hope the insects don't come, hope there isn't any crop disease. Then they hope they have a chance to harvest it in the fall and then hope when they harvest it and truck it to the elevator, it is going to have a decent price. All of that risk, all alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we create a safety net to say we are going to try, if we can, to provide some strength to that hope because we want family farms to continue to exist in the future because we think it strengthens our country. That is why we write a farm bill. All of us come from different points on the compass, but we all believe basically the same thing: family farming matters for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How on Earth have we gotten to the point where, on a Wednesday, a week after we start the debate on the farm bill, we have not been able to consider even one amendment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we risk not getting the farm bill done. How we have gotten to this point, I don't have the foggiest understanding, but it is not healthy and not good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can persuade the minority leader and others to let us proceed. Just start. We are not asking for the Moon. Just start discussion, debate, and vote on amendments, and let's see how quickly we can move through these to try to get a bill done before the end of this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me finish, as I started, by saying I know a lot of people have worked for a long time on this bill. There are a lot of people on both sides of the political aisle who want this bill to get done. I am among them. But there are some who have decided we ought not move forward, and they have decided the only way they would allow us to move forward is to allow all kinds of amendments that go back and recreate the debates on immigration, and you name it. The fact is, all that means is we will not  get this bill done, never get this bill done. So let's go back to the tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tradition has been, with respect to farm bills, we have had farm bills on the floor of the Senate in which we debate and vote on amendments. We do not, in most cases, see amendments that have nothing to do with agriculture load down this bill and decide we are going to try to stop it from moving. I hope we can get back to that tradition. That is the tradition I think farmers would expect of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me again say, as I started, if families out there in the country farmed like we legislate--or at least like a few  people in this Chamber want to legislate--there would be no food because they would never plant the grain. It wouldn't matter, timing doesn't matter, they wouldn't harvest the grain, timing doesn't matter; they wouldn't milk the cows because they wouldn't care whether the cows are fresh or sore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress can do a whole lot better than this, and my hope is, in the coming couple of hours, we can reach agreement and begin debate on the amendments. Let's follow this trail until the amendments are done, and I think that farm bill will get a resounding vote on the floor of the Senate. I think the farm bill will get two-thirds or perhaps three-fourths in favor of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor. I know we have two other Members on the Senate floor. The Senator from Colorado had indicated he wanted to speak, but I know the Senator from Georgia is on the Senate floor as well.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Georgia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments. He is exactly right. There are a lot of us in this body who wish to see this farm bill move. I actually came back a day early last week thinking the farm bill would be up the next day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was prepared, as ranking member, to move ahead with the farm bill. When I got here, I found out we all of a sudden were going to be caught in a process that is unique to the Senate, and that is a process where the majority leader has the right--and I understand he has the right; I understand that we did that when we were in the majority--to fill the tree, and he did so. And when he does so, it kind of brings things to a halt. That is the purpose in doing that, in trying to control what amendments  may be filed. I thought after a week's time, yesterday, rather than us debating amendments, moving through, which in all likelihood we conceivably could have been through this bill by now--but instead of being able to call up amendments, debating them and voting on them over the past week, we have been stuck in this process now that requires a unanimous consent by both sides before we can move forward with the process of dealing with amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday I had some hope, because Senator Harkin and I agreed that what we thought we ought to do would be to come up with a list of amendments that are relevant, and as always is the case on any major piece of legislation, some were irrelevant amendments. I would hope we could agree on a number. Unfortunately, we have not been able to do that. As of yesterday we had about 140 Democratic amendments that were filed, and about 120 Republican amendments that were filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of them are relevant to the farm bill, but some of them are not. But it is always the case that we deal with some nonrelevant amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But instead of allowing Senator Harkin and me to move through the process of taking the amendments--the first one we had agreed to take was Senator Dorgan and Senator Grassley's amendment. Instead of allowing us to move ahead and debate that amendment, and possibly have already voted on it, if we had taken it up this morning with the time agreement we had tentatively agreed to, a decision was made that we are not going to be allowed to do that, and nothing is going  to happen until there is a definite agreement by both sides on not just the number of amendments but what nonrelevant amendments will be considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will happen. I know this is not the first time this situation has happened in this body with a farm bill. I would remind those who were here in 2002, at that time there were 246 amendments filed; almost exactly the same number of amendments were filed to the farm bill while the Democrats were in charge in 2002. There were at least two, and there may have been three, cloture votes. I am not sure because I was not here then. But there were two or three cloture votes asked for and made on the  farm bill before cloture was invoked. Those cloture votes originally were made in December of 2001. When cloture was finally invoked in February of 2002, the farm bill sailed through in a matter of a few days. So we are basically in exactly the same position we were in 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is the problem. 2002 was an entirely different atmosphere in American agriculture. Farmers and ranchers need to be discussing next month with their bankers and their insurers and landowners from whom they lease property, or farmers whom they lease property to; they need to be talking to their equipment dealers about how much they are going to plant of what respective crops; how much insurance they are going to need; how much in the way of financing they are going to need; how much in  the way of new equipment or repairs or replaced equipment they are going to need, so that come next March, in the whole Southeast, not just in my State, but in March we start planting crops. Early corn goes in in March or the first part of April. In 2002, I was a Member of the House, and I was a member of the conference committee on the farm bill that was delayed until final passage occurring</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are stuck in a process. I am not saying one side or the other is more to blame than the other. I think it is more the rules of the Senate that have got us locked into this situation. I am ready to go. I was ready to go last Tuesday morning or actually last Monday afternoon. But, unfortunately, we are in a situation now where we cannot move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did have to object to Senator Harkin's request. There is nothing I would rather do than move on the Grassley-Dorgan amendment, although I am strongly opposed to it. I am going to advocate a "no" vote on it. But I think we ought to move and get this process  going and start winnowing down these 260 or so, whatever the number of amendments is we have filed, or that we have been notified that either are filed or are going to be filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do that. It was done in 2002. We can do it now, and we are ultimately going to have to do it. Whether we do it now or whether we do it in January, whether we do it in February, we are going to do it. It is a bullet we are going to have to bite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret very much having to object to Senator Harkin's request. But, by the same token, he had to not agree to amend his unanimous consent request to comply with what I asked for, which would allow us to move ahead right now with amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those folks who are out in ag country are depending on the Congress, the Presiding Officer being one of those members who sits on the Ag Committee who has a significant interest in agriculture. My friend Senator Salazar, a member of the committee, comes from a strong agricultural State. Folks are depending on all of us as policymakers to get our work done, and yet here we are stuck by the rules of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said in the press yesterday, I would simply say again, if we do not get this bill done this week, we do not have the opportunity to work with our colleagues in the House over the next 2 weeks while we are gone to get ready for a conference in December, it is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get a farm bill passed by both bodies, on the desk of the President before the end of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That does not handicap us, but it surely handicaps those folks we represent; that is, the great men and women who are the farmers and ranchers of America. So I am hopeful that over the next several hours--I do not how long it may take, but I hope in the short term we are able to reach some agreement. Particularly it boils down to the nonrelevant amendments. If the other side would be lenient with us in trying to let us get those amendments up, debate them, get them voted on, we can move this  bill.</paragraph>
