  <narrative>HONORING MARNEE'S COOKIES -- (Senate - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12984">S12984</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Marnee's Cookies, a growing small business from my home State of Maine that recently opened its first retail store in Bath, ME. Marnee's Cookies, a premier gourmet cookie company, held the grand opening of Marnee's Cookie Bistro on September 28 to great fanfare. Originally operated out of owner Marnee Robinson's kitchen, the business is now based out of a 4,000 square-foot facility in downtown Bath, which serves as both a cookie factory and retail  store.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Baking from an early age, Ms. Robinson has developed and refined the quintessential cookie by combining the arts of baking and design. For years, family and friends have enjoyed her two signature cookies--Nirvana and Serendipity--that became the genesis and impetus for her business. In 2005, Ms. Robinson's entrepreneurial dream became a reality when Marnee's Cookies was founded, offering 13 types of gourmet cookies. Originally begun as a home-based Internet company run solely by Ms. Robinson,  the demand for her product quickly expanded into a booming business with loyal customers around the world, from Maine to California, and Paris to India. In fact, Internet orders were so strong that Ms. Robinson was working 18-hour days to ship cookies worldwide. As a result, her growing business needed a facility to accommodate the increasing demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The expansion of Marnee's Cookies was made possible by a $150,000 community development block grant. These grants are awarded to small businesses that will, in turn, contribute to economic development and job creation. The city of Bath saw great potential in Ms. Robinson's business plan and applied for the grant on her behalf. I am confident the grant will be beneficial to Marnee's Cookies, enabling it to further expand its reach and create additional jobs and opportunities for Bath's residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marnee's Cookies is also to be commended for its active involvement in local community and charity events. Cookies are regularly donated to local events and nonprofit organizations ranging from the Bath Soup Kitchen to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Additionally, Marnee's Cookies holds an annual charity event on December 4--National Cookie Day--with a portion of all holiday orders donated to a local charity. These gracious acts of philanthropy cannot go unnoticed and are a shining example  of a small business going above and beyond to serve the local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marnee's Cookies is truly a success story and a bright example of what small businesses can accomplish with measured expansion and consistent determination. I congratulate Marnee Robinson for her entrepreneurial spirit and for being an exceptional role model for Maine and the Nation. We at the Senate wish Marnee's Cookies all the best for many more successful years to come.</paragraph>
