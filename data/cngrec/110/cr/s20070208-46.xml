    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. John M. Queen III, of Waynesville, NC, for recently becoming the president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John is the president and owner of John Queen Farms, a third generation cattle farm located in the mountains of North Carolina. He is a family man, a successful businessman, and a proven leader in his community and the beef industry. Over the years, John has been involved in almost every area of the beef industry from production to sale, and he has served in numerous leadership roles in the beef industry at the county, State, and national levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With his extensive knowledge and experience as a member of the beef industry, John Queen is the kind of leader the beef industry needs right now. In the coming months, a new farm bill will be written that will impact our livestock producers. As a producer, John Queen understands these issues firsthand, and he will have the opportunity to serve as an advocate for his fellow livestock producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The beef industry today is at a pivotal crossroads. As Congress works to secure fair and open markets in Europe and Asia, the beef industry must continue to work diligently to foster consumer confidence in one of our Nation's largest export commodities. As we continue to work with the Canadian Government and governments in Asia to reopen their markets to U.S. beef, we will need diligent and creative leaders such as John Queen to help promote our beef to consumers around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that a fellow North Carolinian will be leading the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. This is a great day for our cattlemen, and for North Carolina as a whole.</paragraph>
