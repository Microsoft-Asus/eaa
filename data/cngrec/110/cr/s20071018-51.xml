  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today Senator Domenici and I submitted a resolution designating next week, the week of October 21-27, 2007 as "National Character Counts Week." I have worked for many years on the issue of character education and hope that by designating a special week to this important cause, students and teachers will come together to participate in character building activities in their schools this week and throughout the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici and I first established the Partnerships in Character Education Pilot Project in 1994 and since then we have worked together regularly to commemorate National Character Counts Week. Character education is about celebrating what's right with young people while enabling them to develop the knowledge and life skills necessary in order to embrace ethical and responsible behavior. I am pleased that we are continuing our efforts today to help expand the ability of States and  schools to make character education a central part of every child's education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While English, math and science provide the figurative bricks of schools, character education provides the mortar. Trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship are the six pillars of character. The standards of conduct that arise out of those values constitute the foundation of ethics, and therefore, of ethical decisionmaking. Character education provides students a context within which to learn. If we view education simply as the imparting of knowledge to our children,  then we will not only miss an opportunity, but we will also jeopardize our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, there are character education programs across all 50 States in rural, urban and suburban areas at every grade level. I hope that in celebrating National Character Counts Week, that more schools in every State adopt similar programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Character education programs work. Schools across the country that have adopted strong character education programs report better student performance, fewer discipline problems, and increased student involvement within their communities. Children want direction; they want to be taught right from wrong. Young people yearn for consistent adult involvement, and when they get it, according to surveys, they are less inclined to use illegal drugs, vandalize property or commit suicide. The American  public wants character education in our schools, too. Studies show that approximately 90 percent of Americans support schools teaching character education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Character education can and is being incorporated into children's lives in and outside of the classroom. It provides a helping hand to our schools and communities to ensure our children's futures are bright and filled with opportunities for success. Character education not only cultivates minds, it nurtures hearts. While our children may only represent one-quarter of our population, they are 100 percent of our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit that character transcends religious, cultural, political, and socio-economic barriers. I believe our country is having a renewed focus on character and this resolution sends a wonderful message to Americans and will help those of us involved in character education reinvigorate our efforts to get more communities and schools involved. So today, Senator Domenici and I submitted a resolution to accomplish just that and hopefully our renewed effort will bring together even more  communities to ensure that character education is a part of every child's life. I hope that my colleagues will join us in this important effort.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today my good friend Senator Dodd and I submitted a resolution designating the week of October 21 as the 2007 National Character Counts Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our character is the foundation of who we are as people and how we are perceived by the world. Every day our character and ethics are tested through the decisions we make and the behavior we exhibit. The National Character Counts program focuses on "Six Pillars of Character" which are promoted through school and community based character education programs across the country. The six pillars are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have supported Character Counts throughout the years because I believe this program reaches out to all youth and adults, as the Character Counts Coalition states, no matter the individual's race, creed, politics, gender, and wealth. In my home state of New Mexico, we have run many successful Character Counts programs throughout the  years. While many schools initiate Character Counts programs there are also many other organizations that develop character  based programming. I would like to take the time to recognize some of the successful programs we have had in New Mexico for 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Character Counts works in New Mexico because it is truly a community partnership. There was a brilliant example last week during the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. The Balloon Fiesta staff hosted 60 selected school kids for 2 days of festive activities. Northrop Grumman provided tethered balloon rides. Meals on Wheels fed the young people lunch, and the Albuquerque Balloon Museum gave some of the students a tour of the exhibits to show them the history of hot air balloons. These were  fun days, but the children certainly learned about civic responsibility with some of our state's top business and community leaders. A once in a lifetime experience for many of these kids, and exposure to adults demonstrating respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness, citizenship, and caring; the "Six Pillars of Character."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the week of October 21, I hope everyone takes the time to participate in a Character Counts event in their local area. I know in New Mexico we will be having some special celebrations. On October 19 in Albuquerque, NM, there will be a Character is the Heart of New Mexico Parade, put on by Duranes Elementary beginning at the Old Town Plaza and ending at the Albuquerque Museum. On October 25, Roswell will celebrate 13 years of Character Counts with a Character Counts Super Celebration at  Roswell High School. And on October 27, Gallup will celebrate with a Character Counts Parade starting at Fourth and Coal and ending at Lincoln Elementary School. All of these organizations and schools as well as the many others not mentioned here, are to be commended for their hard work in developing these programs and spreading the message that character truly does count.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this program is making a difference in my home State and across the country. I want to encourage more people to become involved with the Character Counts program, but most of all I hope individuals will take the time to reflect on what the "Six Pillars of Character" mean to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope all of my colleagues will support this effort.</paragraph>
