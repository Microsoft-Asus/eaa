    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, the Senate will proceed to a period of morning business for up to 60 minutes. Senators will be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each during that period of time, with the times equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. The majority will control the first half and the Republicans the second half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the housing bill, and around 11 or maybe shortly thereafter, we will proceed to a series of three votes on the remaining amendments and passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon disposition of the housing bill, the Senate will proceed to <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the energy lands bill. There are four Coburn amendments in order to the bill, and the proponents and opponents have up to 2 hours to debate the amendments prior to votes on the amendments and passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.</paragraph>
