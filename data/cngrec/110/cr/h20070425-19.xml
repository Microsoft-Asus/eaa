  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the liberal leadership of this Congress has put themselves and the lives of our military members, our soldiers in the field, in a very difficult position. When they passed the supplemental spending bill earlier this month for the global war on terror, they only did it by loading it up with pork. It sounds like a grocery list. They have got money for spinach, for beef, for fish and for peanuts. Billions of dollars of pork. They made their Members an offer that they  couldn't refuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They claim to support our military, but in this bill they tie the hands of that same military by instituting a timetable for withdrawal and taking the power for running the war away from the commanders in the field. The majority leader, HARRY REID, didn't help when he said he thinks the war is lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American citizens need to ask themselves the question: What would happen, what would happen, if we were to walk away? It is the same question our Speaker, who obviously isn't going to meet with our commanding general, also needs to ask.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's respect the soldiers in the field by doing our job and passing a clean budget.</paragraph>
