  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Americans are demanding action as they're being battered by sky-high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The relentless unwillingness to act by this majority has left my constituents fuming and looking for action, not more of the same rhetoric and politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We sit at the precipice of four dollar gasoline. How much higher do these costs have to go before the majority will act? Five dollars? Six dollars? Ten dollars? Is the Democrat majority so out of touch with the American people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this side of the aisle, we have produced an action plan to increase access to new sources of energy, increase American production, encourage alternative fuels, and incentivize conservation. We are ready to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, gas prices have increased 70 percent since you took control of Congress, and it's your duty to act. I call on you to allow the responsible Republican energy plan to come to this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, idleness is not leadership.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
