  <narrative>NATIONAL FRANCHISEE ASSOCIATION -- (Senate - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12431">S12431</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, throughout the course of our Nation's history, the prosperity of America and its citizens has invariably been linked with the success of its economy. Our country should be proud of its entrepreneurs, who are key components of that success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize and thank the National Franchisee Association for providing the support and resources necessary to maintain its membership which consists of Burger King franchisees. The NFA was founded with a mission: "To improve, preserve, and ensure the economic well-being of all members." For nearly 20 years the NFA has delivered this promise by expanding its services and adapting to the ever-changing economic and technological landscape. Today, the NFA's membership is comprised  of approximately 1,200 franchisees from across the country, representing every district in every State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NFA members employ thousands of citizens and provide individuals, especially our Nation's youth, with an opportunity to learn traditional American values, including hard work, cooperation, and responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 10 and 11, the members of the National Franchisee Association will arrive in Washington, DC, to engage and educate this Congress. I therefore encourage my colleagues to welcome the NFA's membership to our Nation's capital and to thank them for their continuous positive contribution to the fabric of our society.</paragraph>
