    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand before all of you today as an example of what can be achieved if provided the opportunity and resources. I grew up in poverty and relied upon loans and grants to pay for my education. In short, I was able to achieve the American Dream because of legislation similar to the College Student Relief Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America, millions of high school students forego higher education because of the financial barriers created by the ever increasing costs of tuition and fees at our colleges and universities. This situation harms qualified but economically disadvantaged students and endangers our country because the American economy relies on a highly skilled and well educated workforce. As a college professor for the past 24 years, I saw firsthand the financial struggle so many students face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call on my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5">H.R. 5</bill> because it is time we provide hope and opportunity to the youth of our country, the youth who want to participate productively in an increasingly globalized economy.</paragraph>
