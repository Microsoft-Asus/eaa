    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SGT Timothy J. Jacobsen, a soldier from my home State of California who paid the ultimate price in service to our country in Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 23, 2008--more than 33 years since the end of the Vietnam war--the Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office announced that the remains of SGT Jacobsen had been identified and would be returned to his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SGT Jacobsen grew up on a dairy ranch in Ferndale, CA--the fifth of eight children born to Margie and Kermit Jacobsen. When his father started his own cattle ranch, SGT Jacobsen spent much of his free time working alongside him. He also started riding bulls at an early age, and by the time he was 18, he had become Humboldt County's top-rated bull rider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1967 SGT Jacobsen's older brother Skip was drafted by the Army and sent to Vietnam. Not long after Skip returned, SGT Jacobsen was drafted and left his family to serve as a doorgunner in the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 16, 1971, SGT Jacobsen was one of four United States soldiers and an unknown number of Republic of Vietnam marines aboard a helicopter on a combat assault mission near Hue, South Vietnam. As the helicopter touched down at the landing zone, it  came under heavy enemy ground fire. The pilot tried to lift off, but the damaged aircraft struck a tree line and exploded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The remains of the four U.S. soldiers on board were not recovered at that time, and a year later, SGT Jacobsen was declared killed in action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, recovery efforts were renewed when a joint U.S.-Socialist Republic of Vietnam team surveyed the crash site. Unfortunately, excavation of the site in 1995 did not uncover remains of the U.S. soldiers aboard the helicopter. However, in 2006, two re-burial sites associated with the incident were excavated, leading to the recovery of SGT Jacobsen's remains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SGT Jacobsen was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, commemorating his courage and extraordinary sacrifice in service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will be buried on October 4 in Ferndale, CA. The Army offered SGT Jacobsen full burial honors in Arlington National Cemetery, but his family chose his final resting place close to home. Nothing can fully account for the loss suffered by SGT Jacobsen's family, and all those who loved him. But I hope this finally brings a sense of closure and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we remember SGT Jacobsen and honor his service to the United States we are also reminded of the nearly 1,800 service members who remain unaccounted for from the Vietnam war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Men and women like Timothy J. Jacobsen from towns and cities across California, and across America, went off to fight in Vietnam. Many of them never came back. We will never forget the lives they led and the sacrifices they made. And we will never rest in our effort to bring each and every American who gave their life home to a Nation that honors their service, and a community that has never forgotten them.</paragraph>
