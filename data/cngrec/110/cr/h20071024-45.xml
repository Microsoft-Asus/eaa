  <narrative>HONORING THE LIFE OF SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11995]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to the House's attention that it was on October 25 a few years ago, not long it seems, only days ago, in 2002 that our State of Minnesota lost Senator Paul Wellstone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wellstone, Mr. Speaker, was a United States Senator, was a professor of politics, political science, at Carleton College. Paul Wellstone was an organizer of average citizens in Minnesota and helped them to discover their own power and their ability to maneuver the instrumentality of government to work for the benefit of the average citizen. Paul Wellstone was actually the State Chair of the Jackson for President campaign in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wellstone was truly a friend of all working people everywhere on the globe. And I just wanted to let you know, Mr. Speaker, that as we approach October 25, and I reflect back upon my own personal exposure and friendship with Paul Wellstone, whose picture hangs in my office right now, that I just wanted this day to go by with us in contemplation of what a true servant leader represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wellstone was a friend of mine. I'm proud to say that he was a political hero of mine as well. I had the awesome benefit of knowing him, and I'll never forget some of the things he said to me. But, among those things was to make sure that you never ever stop listening to the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wellstone was comfortable anywhere he went. He was comfortable in the hair shops, the beauty salons and the laundromats. Paul Wellstone obviously was comfortable in the halls of power in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wellstone, wherever he went, was a person who understood that he carried a sacred trust, that government service was a trust that the people of the State of Minnesota entrusted in him, that it was not a privilege, but it was an awesome responsibility, and he never forgot it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wellstone was a leader in many ways and was an example to young people like myself. And as I think what his life means to me, means to the people of Minnesota, I have to consider that it is also that awesome responsibility that he laid out there. A servant leader, Mr. Speaker. Not just somebody who was looking to be served but a person who was looking to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Wellstone's favorite color was green, that was the color of his campaign literature, because it symbolized life. And I shamelessly copied it, Mr. Speaker, because I wanted to carry on that spirit of service, of being evergreen, of being ever new, and being committed to the idea that we have to constantly and continuously renew ourselves, our values, our faith, and our consistency when it comes to serving people all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that whether it was veterans, of whom Paul Wellstone was a tireless advocate, or whether it was students or whether it was the poor in our country, and I will never forget the tour he took around this country to highlight poverty in America, Paul Wellstone could always be found serving people. His loss was a tragic loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only the day before we lost him, he was scheduled to come to my office, and we were going to do some campaigning together. It was a long night, Mr. Speaker, when we heard back the reports as the news reports said that a plane has gone down in Ely, Minnesota, and it was thought to be containing Paul Wellstone and his partner, Sheila Wellstone, and their daughter and several other campaigners. We hoped all night that what we thought might have happened didn't happen, but at the end of the evening,  we learned that that tragedy, in fact, did occur. Our worst fears were confirmed when we learned that we lost him, but it was a long several hours before we realized that that tragedy had actually occurred, and we had hoped against hope. I will never forget that night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I wind down my remarks, I just want to say that in many ways I have dedicated my service and take great inspiration from Senator Wellstone. I will never forget him, and I hope that this House and Senate never do, either.</paragraph>
