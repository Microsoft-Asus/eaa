  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO KEN HARPER -- (Senate - February 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="848">S848</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish honor Ken Harper, a fellow Arkansan who has embraced the spirit of patriotism. Not only has he served our country in the military, but he has created inspirational poetry and a special commemorative gift to veterans. Ken Harper has a unique talent for writing poetry of a "military significance" and "significance of character" that gives inspiration to those who read it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ken Harper proudly served in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army. He served a tour of duty with the U.S. Navy beginning in 1979. In 1985, he chose to continue his military career by serving in the U.S. Army. After his military service was completed, Ken still had the desire to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by the fallen sailors and marines of Pearl Harbor, Ken requested a few American flags to be flown from military memorials and ships on behalf of some retired veterans he knew. The success of this motivated him to have more flags flown in dedication of other veterans. Later, he would have two special flags he claims as his own raised on several naval ships and even on board a NASA space ship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because Ken Harper has selflessly honored so many, today we honor him for his efforts, talents, and service to our country.</paragraph>
