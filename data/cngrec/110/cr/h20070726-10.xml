    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a man from Kansas said, "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, and the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging  on a cross of iron." Dwight David Eisenhower, April 16, 1953.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that the rest of my time be in silence for those who have died in Iraq, Americans and Iraqis.</paragraph>
