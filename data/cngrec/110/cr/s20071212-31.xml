United States Marine Corps SSG Charles M. Evers, of Lewiston, ID, was awarded this medal for "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving as Platoon Commander, 3d Platoon, India Company, 3d Battalion, 5th Marines, Regimental Combat Team, 1 Marine Expeditionary Force Forward in Support of Operation Iraqi  Freedom from 8 June to 12 June 2006."

Most of all, I thank him and his fellow Marines for continuing to defend my freedom and that of my family.</paragraph>
