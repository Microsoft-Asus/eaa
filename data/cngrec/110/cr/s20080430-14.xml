  <narrative>AAA SCHOOL SAFETY PATROLLERS -- (Senate - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3586">S3586</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of three young Americans recently chosen by the American Automobile Association to receive the School Safety Patrol Lifesaving award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1920, the American Automobile Association, AAA, began the School Safety Patrol Program in order to ensure that children across the country could commute to school in a safe manner. Today over 500,000 young people participate in this program, and every year since 1949, the AAA has recognized those patrollers who go above and beyond their duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly 50 years, the AAA has given its highest School Safety Patrol honor, the Lifesaving Award, to those patrollers who have risked their own lives to save the life of another. Today I have the great honor of recognizing three courageous patrollers who, while on duty, showed the kind of clear-thinking, quick-acting skills that save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nicole Epstein participates in the School Safety Patrol Program at North Chevy Chase Elementary in Chevy Chase, MD, not far from where we stand today. In June of 2007, an 8-year-old boy watched the traffic light turn to green and began to cross a busy road, unaware that a car making a right-hand turn was heading directly toward him. Nicole, seeing the oncoming car, stepped off the curb and grabbed the boy's backpack to pull him to safety. The driver of the car must not have seen the boy, because  the vehicle completed the turn and drove on  with out slowing down or acknowledging the children. Through her bravery and quick thinking, Nicole saved this young boy from being hit by that car.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raul Valdez, a AAA school safety patroller at West Gate Elementary in Manassas, VA, showed great courage when he saved a young girl who ran out in front of an oncoming van on April 13, 2007. Following an adult guard's "hold back" instruction, Raul put his arms up to prevent students from crossing the busy area of the school drive where buses and daycare vans collect children. When a young girl attempted to run across the drive, Raul reached for her shoulder and swiftly pulled her out of the  way of an approaching daycare van. Thanks to Raul's attentiveness and his speedy reaction time, that young girl was saved from harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clarissa Sourada is a safety patroller at Union Mill Elementary in Clifton, VA. On a morning in February 2007, Clarissa was holding two children at the edge of a residential driveway near her post, waiting for the clear to cross, when she noticed a vehicle backing towards them. She alerted the children to the danger and called for them to move out of the way. When one child did not heed her warning, Clarissa pushed the child from the driveway to the sidewalk, safely out of the path of the car.  That child's life was saved thanks to Clarissa's quick thinking and attentive supervision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As these three exceptional young people have demonstrated, the participants in the AAA School Safety Patrol Program serve an important role in ensuring that our young people get to school safely. This program has helped save countless lives, and I thank the AAA and the program volunteers for making it all possible. I know I speak for every Member of the Senate in expressing our gratitude for their valuable work in our communities.</paragraph>
