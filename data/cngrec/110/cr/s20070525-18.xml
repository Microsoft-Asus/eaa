    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to congratulate the men's tennis team from my alma mater, the University of Georgia, for winning the 2007 NCAA Men's Tennis Championship in Athens, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bulldogs defeated the University of Illinois 4 to 0 in the final round of play to capture their fifth men's NCAA national championship in front of a sold out crowd in Athens, leading to the school's 24th national title overall. The team entered the season ranked No. 1 in the country, and completed the season with a perfect 32 to 0 record, making them only the fifth men's tennis team in history to go undefeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an alumnus of this great university, I am extremely proud and would like to congratulate team members Brad Benedict, Luis Flores, Travis Helgeson, Alex Hill, Jamie Hunt, Chris Motes, Nate Schnugg, Joshua Varela, Christian Vitulli, and Tri-Captains Ricardo Gonzalez, John Isner, and Matic Omerzel for their hard work and accomplishments. Additionally, I would like to congratulate Matic Omerzel on being named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. Undoubtedly, the team's successes would not have  been possible without the guidance and encouragement from legendary head coach Manuel Diaz, assistant coach Will Glenn and graduate assistant athletic trainer Michael Neumann. This title is the third for the university under Coach Diaz, making him the only active coach with multiple NCAA championships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, congratulations to the Georgia Bulldogs for their achievement.</paragraph>
