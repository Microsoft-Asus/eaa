  <narrative>ARMED FORCES DAY -- (Senate - May 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4272">S4272</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, tomorrow we celebrate Armed Forces Day. Communities across my State, from Van Wert to St. Clairsville, from Sandusky to Ironton, will pause to honor the service and sacrifice of the men and women in all branches of the military service as they and we celebrate Armed Forces Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have held close to 100 roundtables around my State where, in many of them, I had the opportunity to speak with dozens of these honorable man and women. Those conversations reinforced my profound respect for their unstinting bravery, their unshakable sense of duty, and their unwavering commitment to our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not long ago, at Walter Reed I visited two Ohio marines recovering from wounds suffered in Iraq. I asked each of them what was the first thing they thought about when they realized they were wounded. Both marines, independently of one another, said: "Can I stay in the Marines." That simple statement speaks volumes about our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Armed Forces Day is an opportunity to honor our troops, an opportunity to honor the sacrifices they and, equally importantly, their families have made to protect our Nation, and an opportunity to honor the promises our Nation has made to repay their services and sacrifices. That is so important. We are stewards of those promises. We have a responsibility to work every day, against opposition sometimes, to ensure that our Armed Forces receive the wages and benefits and services they have earned.  Honoring our troops should be more than sentiment. It should be action. When we make promises to our troops, we should keep them. They most certainly have kept their promises to us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join the remarks of the Senator from Ohio acknowledging the great contribution made to America by our men and women in uniform. I hope we can honor their service, not only by providing for them while they are at war but providing for them as well when they come home. I am sure the Senator joins me in believing that a new GI bill which will provide for those returning soldiers is a fitting tribute to their service and a great investment in our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our initial GI bill after World War II was born in conflict. After World War I, those returning soldiers marched on Washington time and again, demanding some payment for their service to our country. They were rebuffed and even attacked at times by our then Army in uniform. By the Second World War, we understood that we owed a great debt to the 16 million men and women who served, and 8 million of them took advantage of the GI bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That GI bill was groundbreaking and revolutionary. It paid for their tuition, their books, their room and board, as well as a monthly allotment so they could go to school. Those graduates of the GI bill became the thriving middle class of America that built our great Nation in the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. It was the greatest single investment in returning soldiers in our history, and it should be replicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who honor the armed services should also honor them when they come home, to make sure they receive all the health care and benefits promised and are given a chance to have a full life after having served our country so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to identify myself with the remarks of the Senator from Ohio.</paragraph>
