  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the majority leader asked unanimous consent to bring the ethics bill to the floor. He filled the tree, limiting amendments. I wish to spend a minute talking about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I honestly believe we are never going to have the problems fixed in Washington until we have absolute and complete transparency on earmarks. Senator DeMint and I have both, numerous times, asked for unanimous consent that what we voted on 96 to 0 in the Senate be the order of the day when it comes to transparency on earmarks. That was rejected. We had a Democratic conference, and what we actually did--and I am not saying this partisanly at all; this is not a partisan issue--but what  we did is gutted the transparency portion of the earmark reform. If you think the problems are going to stop with the ethics bill that is going to be coming up, we have another thought coming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the leadership has done, the majority leader along with those in the other body, they have cleaned the outside of the cup to what looks like is a good deal for the American public, but when you look over the edge of the cup, what you see is filth, what you see is a lack of integrity, what you see is a planned method to skirt transparency. The only thing Americans should believe is the only way they are going to know everything is on the up and up in this body is with 100 percent transparency.  Anything less than that will not get you the accountability, will not solve the ethical problems that are out there. We need to be about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to work hard to talk about that more. I think it is uncompromising what we are seeing done at this time to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people when it comes to earmarks. That is not a partisan issue. I am against earmarks, especially if they are not 100 percent transparent. But if you look at every ethical lapse that has happened in this body, it always goes back to earmarks. When they are transparent, and fully transparent to where the American people can see it, you  are going to start getting good Government again. Until then, you are not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am here today to talk about the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I, first, do wish to say I am very pleased we are advancing an ethics bill in the Senate. I am very pleased with the work the majority leader has done on this bill. As a freshman class, we came in with some energy, and we came in with a commitment that we cannot do business as usual in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This ethics bill, as many outside groups have stated, is the most sweeping ethics reform we have seen since Watergate. It is about banning gifts and free meals. It is about not allowing people to take advantage of corporate jets. It is about bringing transparency to the earmark process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very glad this advanced. I did not agree with a few of our Members who tried to block this from going to conference committee. I am glad we found a way procedurally to bring this legislation to the Senate. I am very hopeful it will pass the Senate, as it passed the House today.</paragraph>
