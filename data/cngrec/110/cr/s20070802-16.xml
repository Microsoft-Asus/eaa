    <paragraph>Mr. President, early in the consideration of the children's health insurance bill we are now considering, I offered an amendment, No. 2534. The amendment was to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, a piece of legislation we have moved through the Indian Affairs Committee, an authorization for Indian health care matters that has been proposed 11 times before in the last 8 years but has not passed the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a full-scale emergency and crisis with respect to Indian health care. I will not go on at great length except to say this: This Government has a responsibility for health care for Federal prisoners, and we also have a trust responsibility for health care for American Indians. We spend twice as much per person on health care for Federal prisoners as we do to meet our trust responsibility to provide health care for American Indians. I believe I can say without hesitation that there will  be people who will die today and tomorrow in this country because we do not have adequate health care and have not kept our promise to the American Indians with respect to the trust responsibility for health care on Indian reservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have determined we are going to pass this legislation this year. With the cooperation of my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, who indicated yesterday the Finance Committee will mark up this bill on September 12--it is a very important commitment from someone who shares my passion on this and who is a very strong supporter of American Indians and Indian health care--and with a commitment from Senator Reid, who similarly is a very strong supporter of these issues, that  he will bring that bill to the floor of the Senate in this session of the Congress--with those commitments, I believe we will now, finally, in the Senate, pass the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, at long last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With those commitments, I am confident we are on the road to getting done what we need to get done to meet our responsibility. Because of that, I will withdraw my amendment to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act on this Children's Health Insurance Program bill, and I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 2534.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is an important amendment in the context of what we are doing with regard to the SCHIP program. It will ensure that families who are now covered by health insurance stay covered and are not, in fact--perhaps unintentionally but are nonetheless--kicked off or encouraged to leave their current health insurance for the SCHIP program. It is an issue called crowding out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of the amendment is very clear. We want to encourage children who are eligible for SCHIP but currently have access to employer coverage to use that employer coverage. If they have difficulty maintaining that because of costs, we want to give States the flexibility so they can maintain that coverage. What we do not want to do--certainly what I do not want to do, what Senator DeMint does not want to do, and I hope what the huge majority of Members of this body do not want to do--is  create a mechanism to push people off good private insurance or to encourage them to drop good private insurance or to encourage employers to drop that coverage simply because we are reauthorizing and perhaps expanding SCHIP. No child and no family should be forced onto any Government health insurance program if they are currently insured otherwise through the private sector, through the employer, et cetera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBO's own numbers show that 40 percent to 50 percent of the kids covered under SCHIP and 40 percent to 50 percent of those who would become eligible under this SCHIP expansion are, in fact, kids who are shifted out of private  coverage into SCHIP. The CBO analysis on this issue is very clear on this point. In my mind, there is no reason the taxpayers should be paying for that insurance for folks already on good private sector insurance. We should not  be encouraging this very significant shift, this very significant crowding out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I suggested, opponents of this amendment might say: We are not for that because it may be too costly for some of these families to pay premiums in private plans even if they are currently on them. We recognize that argument and that reality. Our amendment--this is very significant--our amendment allows premium subsidies for these individuals who need that to keep them on their current private coverage and to ensure that coverage is affordable. We maintain State flexibility in implementing  those subsidies. We give the States enough leeway, enough flexibility to create and maintain those subsidies to keep folks on good private insurance. The Vitter-DeMint amendment requires individuals who are eligible for SCHIP but currently have employer coverage to continue to use that coverage. If they truly need help, truly need premium subsidies, States have the flexibility to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the clear majority of the public and the majority of those in Congress support Government help to those who need it. But just as true, a clear majority of the public, a clear majority of us do not want to create an incentive to kick people out of insurance they have. We do not want to create an incentive for employers to end or limit insurance they have. That would be a very negative consequence of these good intentions. Our amendment prevents that to a great extent. In doing so, I  have to say I think it draws a clear philosophical divide: Do we give people the resources, the ability to continue with their current quality care in the private sector or are we, in fact, all for pushing people into a one-size-fits-all Government-run program rather than allowing them that choice and that quality care in the private sector? My amendment says</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is an idea which should have broad consensus and bipartisan support. I look forward to that on the floor of the Senate and invite my colleagues to look at this and then support the Vitter-DeMint amendment, No. 2596.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to talk about putting our country on a path to insuring all of its children. For the past decade, the Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIP--has given kids in working families the doctor's visits and medicines they need when they are sick, and the checkups they need to stay well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Skyrocketing health care costs combined with a decline in employer-sponsored health insurance means that thousands of kids and families would go without basic medical care if CHIP did not fill the need. There are now more than 46 million uninsured Americans--9 million are children. This is simply unacceptable--every child needs health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without health insurance, many families must forgo routine checkups, crossing their fingers that their children will stay healthy. If their son or daughter becomes ill, they wait to see if the symptoms go away. But delay can be tragic. If those symptoms linger or get worse, parents are forced to take their kids to the emergency room for help. When a common cold turns into pneumonia, what would have been a simple, cheap fix if caught early, mushrooms into a complicated, lengthy and expensive treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wisconsin's CHIP program, called BadgerCare, serves 67,000 working families and makes all the difference in a child's future. BadgerCare kids are healthier and more likely to succeed in school--including increased school attendance and a greater ability to pay attention in class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, there are over 100,000 kids in Wisconsin who are eligible for BadgerCare, but are left out--in danger of having a small health problem becoming a life threatening illness. In order to reach these kids, Wisconsin received a waiver from this administration to cover their parents. Secretary Leavitt recognized that when the family is insured, children have better access to health care and get the preventative health services they need saving expensive trips to the emergency room. BadgerCare  provides seamless coverage for families and works to reduce the number of uninsured children. Strengthening BadgerCare will ensure that this successful program can continue to cover working families in Wisconsin. It is a good investment of our scarce Federal dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan Senate Finance Committee agreement to renew CHIP is the right approach. It provides an investment of $35 billion over 5 years to strengthen CHIP and it is completely paid for. No one loses health coverage as a result of this reauthorization. It keeps coverage for the 6.6 million low-income children currently enrolled in CHIP and gives States the resources necessary to reach an additional 3.2 million uninsured children eligible but not enrolled in CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The initial price tag may seem steep, but, in the long run, it will save money. By catching and treating childhood illnesses early, we will save money that would be spent on emergency care. I want to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley for their tireless work on this compromise. It is my hope that the Senate will act to put kids first and support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss my amendment to codify the unborn child rule in the pending SCHIP legislation. This needs to be done, and it needs to be done in this reauthorization. The unborn child rule is a regulation that since 2002 has allowed States to provide prenatal care to unborn children and their mothers. It recognizes the basic fact that the child is in the womb--the child in the womb is a child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a pregnancy is involved, there are at least two patients; there is the mother and there is the baby. It only makes sense to cover the unborn child under a children's health program. The bill before us modifies the SCHIP statute to allow States to cover pregnant women of any age. It also contains language that asserts that the bill does not affirm either the legality or illegality of the 2002 "unborn child" rule. My amendment would codify the principle of the rule by amending the SCHIP  law to clarify that a covered child:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>includes, at the option of a State, an unborn child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment further defines "unborn child" with a definition drawn verbatim from Public Law 108-212, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. So it is not new language in our statute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would also clarify that the coverage for the unborn child may include services to benefit either the mother or unborn child consistent with the health of both. In addition, the amendment clarifies that the States may provide mothers with postpartum services for 60 days after they give birth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many States' definition of coverage for pregnant women leads to the strange legal fiction that the adult pregnant woman is a child. Surely it was not the intent of anyone to develop a State Children's Health Insurance Program to allow a loophole for States to define a woman as a child. Surely we can agree that the child in the womb who receives health care is a child receiving care along with his or her mother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment will also allow for coverage of the mother, whereas the pending legislation only allows for pregnancy-related services. There are many conditions that can affect the mother's health during pregnancy that are not related to her pregnancy. Under the pending legislation, a pregnant mother could not get coverage for any condition that is not related to her pregnancy. We should be allowing mothers to stay healthy so they will have healthy babies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This also leads to reduced costs associated with premature or low birth-weight babies. Eleven States are already using this option to provide such care through the State Children's Health Insurance Program. If the intent of the sponsors is to provide coverage for the pregnant woman and her unborn child, then they should have no problem supporting my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should ensure that pregnant women and their unborn children are both treated as patients. This is a matter of common sense. Every obstetrician knows that in treating a pregnant woman, he is treating two patients, the mother and her unborn child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping this coverage in the name of the adult pregnant woman alone is bad for the integrity of a children's health program, bad for the child, and even bad for some of the neediest of pregnant women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am urging my colleagues to support my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from Montana.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, as I have said many times in this debate, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act is good for America. I wish to take a few minutes to talk about why this children's health bill is good for my home State of Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Montana ranks fifth highest in the Nation for the percentage of children without health insurance. In 2006, 37,000 Montana children did not have health insurance. That is one in every six children. More than half of those uninsured children, that is 19,000, were either eligible for Medicaid or for CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, but not enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the reasons for our higher rate of uninsured kids is because the percentage of employers offering health care to Montana's working families is quite low. Less than half of all employers in the State of Montana offered health coverage in 2005. This means many working families do not have access to health coverage. Although families who do not have access to coverage through work could buy it on their own, health coverage is often priced out of reach for lower income families. The average  cost of a family health plan on the open market in Montana is about $8,000 a year. That is nearly one-fifth of the family's income for a family of four earning $41,300, which is twice the poverty level. Again, the average cost is about $8,000, which is about one-fifth of a family's income for a family of four earning $40,000, and most families simply obviously cannot afford that cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIP, the legislation before us, offers affordable, comprehensive health coverage for working families. CHIP works, and it has helped thousands of Montana families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abigail Tuhy's family is one of those families. Abigail's mom, Fawn, is a mother of four, and Fawn's story tells volumes about why we need CHIP. She writes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know what our family of six would do without [CHIP]. ..... In one year, my 2 1/2 -year-old had nine stitches because she split her head open and my 6 year old broke his arm two times. CHIP paid for the surgery, hospital stay and all of the care provided. CHIP has also paid for all of my children to receive all of their shots and their check-ups. Without CHIP, I would not have insurance for my children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abigail is only one of the more than 38,000 children helped by CHIP over the past decade. Today more than 14,000 Montana children are covered by it and the number is growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the Montana legislature, for example, took a positive step forward, changing the CHIP eligibility level from 150 percent to 175 percent of the Federal poverty line. That is just over $36,000 for a family of four. Montana started implementing this expansion in July, which will bring an additional 2,000 children next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is clearly good news, but we cannot rest on our laurels. There are more uninsured children who need our help. The CHIP Reauthorization Act will provide Montana with the funding it needs to maintain current CHIP enrollment, fund its expansion, and make significant strides toward covering more of the uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this legislation, Montana would receive about $28 million next year. That is $12 million more than its allotment for last year. New CHIP allotments, combined with new funds in the State to expand coverage to low-income  children, could allow the State to cover as many as 12,000 children who are uninsured today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us also includes new funding to help Montana improve access to health care, including $200 million in new Federal grant money for States to improve the availability and comprehensiveness of dental health for children, and $100 million in Federal grants to improve outreach and enrollment, especially in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes provisions that specifically target Indian Country. Although Indian children are eligible for coverage through the Indian Health Service and tribal facilities, the IHS, the Indian Health Service, is only funded at 60 percent of need today, leading to tragic denials of care when funds run out. I mean it is abominable. This bill makes important changes to improve the health of Indian children. It provides new funds for outreach and enrollment in Medicaid and in CHIP. It  also allows those Indians to use tribal documents to prove citizenship for Medicaid. It gives States a higher Federal match for translation and interpretation services in the program. And it requires the Secretary to monitor racial and ethnic disparities in care. All move us to a healthier future for Indian children in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we debate CHIP today, let us remember the uninsured children in our home States, those kids who need help. In Montana, there are mothers whose daughters have cystic fibrosis. There are Native American children without health care coverage because they do not have a birth certificate. So let's keep in mind the children of Montana and every other State who need and deserve our help. Let's reauthorize this Children's Health Insurance Program today and improve the health of all American children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator Clinton and the others I have mentioned here, I seek to, as soon as possible, meet the suggestions that have been recommended by the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. I want to express my gratitude to my colleague from New York as well as to others who have joined with us on this effort. This report was submitted to the President by our former colleague, Senator Dole, former Secretary of  Health Donna Shalala, and this report is rather extensive on their recommendations on how we might better serve our returning soldiers from the theaters of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's Commission on Care for the Returning Wounded recommended:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That Congress should amend the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow up to 6 months of leave for a family member of a servicemember who has a combat-related injury and meets the other eligibility requirements in the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of many things I have done over the last 25 years in the Senate. None exceeds my sense of pride more than passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Along with Senator Bond, Senator Dan Coats, Senator Specter, Senator Kennedy, and many others, after 7 years, three American Presidents, and two vetoes, we were able to adopt the Family and Medical Leave Act which, since its passage, has assisted more than 60 million Americans in being away from  their jobs to be with family members during critical times in their lives without losing that job. These important life situations include the joyous occasion of a birth or adoption and the difficult circumstance of an illness of a child or another family member for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. It has been a remarkable asset to many people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suspect there is not a single American family who would not relate to the importance of being able to be with a family member during a time of significant crisis. Obviously, as our wounded warriors coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq are recovering from their injuries, having their families and others with them could be of immeasurable help. Senator Dole and Donna Shalala and other members of the Commission rightly made the recommendation that we should amend the Family and Medical Leave  Act to provide for up to 6 months' leave for a family member to be with these individuals without losing their job. That is what we have done with the amendment we are offering to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, this bill has nothing to do with family medical leave. My colleagues from Montana and Iowa, have a tremendous responsibility in adopting the legislation before us, of which I am a strong supporter. But, knowing that we only have a short time before we adjourn for more than a month, there is a sense of urgency about providing for these families. I would hope all of us would support this amendment. This is a bipartisan suggestion that will make a difference in the lives of families who  are assisting in the recovery of a wounded warrior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend former Senator Dole, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and the distinguished members of the Commission for their thoughtfulness and thorough work on this matter. As the author of the underlying law, I have worked to maintain its protections and extend its protections to assist more employees. I agree with the Commission that FMLA is the best method for providing critical support for our returning heroes who are recovering from their war wounds. I am pleased  to be joined, as a principal cosponsor, by Senator Clinton of New York. After more than 7 years of work, as I mentioned earlier, this proposal I made more than 20 years ago became law. It became law within days after January 20, 1993, when President William Jefferson Clinton, as his very first act, signed into law the Family and Medical Leave Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember with great clarity that bright day overlooking the rose garden at the White House, President Clinton signing that bill into law. Pat Schroeder of the other body was the principal author in the House of Representatives and too often gets neglected in talking about the history of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I will be eternally grateful to Pat Schroeder for the tremendous job she did in the other body in seeing to it that this proposal became the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commission's findings indicate the critical role that family members play in the recovery of our wounded servicemembers:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In their survey, 33 percent of active duty, 22 percent of reserve component, and 37 percent of retired/separated servicemembers report that a family member or close friend relocated for extended periods of time to be with them while they are in the hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-one percent of active duty, 15 percent of reserve component and 24 percent of retired/separated servicemembers say friends or family gave up a job to be with them or act as their caregiver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 3,000 servicemembers have been seriously injured during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In virtually every case, a wife, husband, parent, brother, or sister has received the heart stopping telephone call telling them that their loved one is sick, or injured, halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Family or close friends stayed to assist recovery of almost 66 percent of active duty and 54 percent of reserve component servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Support for Injured Servicemembers Act provides up to 6 months of family and medical leave for spouses, children, parents and next of kin of servicemembers who suffer from a combat-related injury or illness. FMLA currently provides for 3 months of unpaid leave to a spouse, parent or child providing care for a person with a serious illness. Our servicemembers need more. These are extraordinary circumstances. The point of the Commission and the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors  Act that the Senate recently passed is to take care of our wounded soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with combat-related injuries. We should support their families in caring for these heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is essential we do everything possible to support our troops, to allow their loved ones to be with them as they recover from combat-related injuries or illnesses. That is why we should expand and improve benefits for those caring for our servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me emphasize the major points: You have to have been injured in the theater of combat, Afghanistan or Iraq or in preparation for deployment. Our amendment allows for a parent, spouse, child or next of kin to provide that care-giving role. It would allow them to be with them for up to 6 months without losing their jobs. The leave is without pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the universe we are talking about? It is not the entire Nation, obviously, or anyone who is wearing a uniform who happens to have been injured. You have to have been injured or acquired the illness as a result  of being in the combat theater or when preparing to be deployed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment is specific as to who could be the caregiver. It is very specific about the amount of time an employee acting as a caregiver would be covered. We have tried to narrow this down in a way. I am grateful to Bob Dole. He called me last Thursday early on and remembered that I had spent such as inordinate amount of time, with the help of Senator Kennedy and others, to adopt the Family and Medical Leave Act so many years ago. Most would agree today it has made a difference in  the lives of people. I can't think of any better constituency to serve with expanded family medical leave than our service men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see my colleague from Georgia. I thank him as well for being a cosponsor of this proposal. Those preparing for deployment obviously would be covered, if they end up being affected as a result of their injuries or illness suffered while in the theater of combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, as someone who has been a floor manager of many bills over the years, I understand that is not easy to get a particularly difficult bill like this done. I applaud the commitment my colleague from Montana has brought to this legislation. It is my hope that we can achieve the kind of unanimity around this idea of supporting military families, given the fact that the President's Commission is calling for this, our former colleagues calling for it. We have a strong bipartisan group of Senators  who believe this is worthwhile to do for this limited group of our fellow citizens who have suffered immeasurably as a result of their contribution. I would hope before we leave here in these next 24 or 48 hours that the very least we could do would be to provide this kind of benefit for them and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly appreciate the work of our cosponsors. In particular, their willingness to adopt a provision that would expand the pool of typical caregivers under current law for this specific purpose. Those caregivers are limited to spouses, children, and parents. Our amendment extends the caregiver role to next of kin, a brother, sister or other relative, perhaps.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the Senator is running for President, we are glad to accommodate him for what time he needs. He is serious and very emotional about this issue, and he should be. We all should be. I commend the Senator from Connecticut for spending a good bit of time on talking about this issue. I commend the Senator from New York for bringing this issue to the forefront. We are in a war unlike any war we have ever been in before. We are in different times today with respect to military conflicts, and the  inclusion of our wounded warriors in the Family and Medical Leave Act is certainly well deserved and something that I hope we get passed before we leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to commend the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors for their hard, high-quality work in analyzing and recommending improvements for our Nation's treatment of wounded warriors. The Dole-Shalala Commission has boldly addressed one of the most important issues facing our military today and has created a simple roadmap that will help make monumental improvements to the military health care system. I am pleased the Commission's recommendations span agencies,  cross services, and take into consideration the needs of both veterans as well as their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During their review, they visited 23 health care facilities, including military and VA hospitals and treatment centers nationwide, held 7 public meetings, heard testimony from military health care experts, and communicated directly with servicemembers, their families, and health care professionals. This dialog is greatly needed and must continue. I provided my own input directly to the Commission regarding one of Georgia's own success stories in providing care to wounded warriors through a  partnership between the Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon, GA, and the Augusta VA hospital. This Commission untangled a web of complex issues and provided six recommendations based on their findings. Former Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala did what others have been trying to do since World War II. Their joint statement succinctly describes the culmination of these efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The face of our military has changed, as have their needs. Some returning servicemembers, injured in the line of duty, have complex and often multiple injuries placing greater challenges on the DOD and VA as well as family members. Well-meaning attempts over the years to reform health care in the military and VA have produced many positive results that have also made the system more complex and confusing in some areas. In these cases, it is difficult for servicemembers, their families,  and caregivers to understand how to navigate the system. The events that brought us to this point were inexcusable and could have been prevented. However, I would be remiss if I did not mention a letter I received from a constituent whose son was a patient at Walter Reed Medical Center, after being evacuated from Iraq due to injuries he sustained in an IED attack. The letter said to the commander and staff at Walter Reed:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You and your staff are a remarkable team that has the welfare of our soldiers and families foremost in mind as you execute your critically important duties. My family and I owe you and your team our heartfelt thanks and debt of gratitude we can never repay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This kind of feedback tells me the Army's improvements are taking hold. Through the Commission and recent legislation, these improvements will continue. I applaud the Commission's work and am equally pleased that much of it parallels the initiatives set forth by the Senate's Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act. The President's Commission recommended that seriously wounded servicemembers receive a patient-centered recovery plan developed by a cadre of highly skilled recovery coordinators.  Such a plan can only increase the level of support given to our wounded warriors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along these same lines, the Wounded Warrior bill requires development of a unified and comprehensive policy between the VA and the Department of Defense that addresses personnel strength, training, access, standards, family counseling, and creation of a DOD-wide ombudsman. Of central importance, the Commission recommends a complete restructure of the disability and compensation systems. We have all heard case after case of lost paperwork, endless waste, bureaucratic delays, and confusing redundant  processes. Both the Commission and the Wounded Warrior bill provide guidance to consolidate systems and streamline this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important recommendations made by the Commission, also addressed in the Wounded Warrior bill, concerns increased support to the families of our Wounded Warriors. Although the Commission did not visit Georgia, I have spent time at Fort Stewart and Fort Benning with family members of deployed troops, and I have spent as much time with the troops themselves in my five visits to Iraq. I can tell you that when it comes to taking care of our servicemembers, the well-being of their  families is of paramount, if not greater, importance to them than their own well-being. These troops can count on their families. The more we support the families, the better we are taking care of our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other things, the Dole-Shalala report recommends extending privileges under the Family and Medical Leave Act from 12 weeks to 6 months, which will allow family members to take up to 6 months of leave to care for a wounded servicemember. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill that introduces legislation that enacts this recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill Senator Pryor and I cosponsored on this subject, the Wounded  Warrior Assistance Act, <bill type="s" number="1283">S. 1283</bill>, also contains provisions along these lines, such as advocating counseling and job placement services for family members, as well as the creation of an ombudsman's office which will provide support to members and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, once again, I commend Senator Clinton for her initiative in getting this bill on the Family Medical Leave Act introduced and I concur again with the Senator from Connecticut. I hope this legislation is completed before we leave here in the next couple of days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The global war on terror has brought recognition of the enormous impact of two previously silent and little-noticed conditions to the forefront: post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Accordingly, both the Commission and the Wounded Warrior bill address these issues. The Dole-Shalala report advocates the most aggressive treatment for both conditions by the DOD and the VA, and also recommends private-sector involvement to capitalize on the most recent and valuable findings  and treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, the Wounded Warrior bill provides comprehensive and coordinated policies between DOD and the VA on PTSD and TBI. The Wounded Warrior bill creates a level of accountability for the DOD and VA by requiring an annual report on PTSD and TBI expenditures and reports assessing progress in the overall treatment of these conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also includes a provision I proposed that builds upon a study at Emory University for TBI treatment and the use of progesterone and directs collaboration between DOD and other Federal agencies in TBI-related research and clinical trials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The approach taken by the Commission and in the Wounded Warrior Act capitalizes on cooperation among Federal agencies, as well as between the Federal Government and private sector. As part of the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, I proposed a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that DOD continue to encourage collaboration between the Army and the VA in the treatment of wounded warriors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A prime example of this type of collaboration is in Augusta, GA, between the only Active-Duty rehabilitation unit, located at the Augusta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and the behavioral health care services program at the Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon, GA. This unique, unprecedented collaboration between the Augusta VA and the Eisenhower Army Medical Center has been growing since its inception in 2004, assisted by GEN Eric Schoomaker, now the head of Walter Reed  and former commander of the Eisenhower Army Medical Center. Our wounded warriors deserve the best possible care. The recommendations of the President's Commission and the requirements set forth in the Dignity for Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act pave a clear path for the type of medical treatment and support the people defending our Nation deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Wounded Warrior Act, unanimously approved by the Senate. I am pleased with the comprehensive recommendations provided by Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala. I especially thank the servicemembers and their families who have shared openly and bravely about their experiences to this body as well as to the Commission. Their stories made the need for this reform real to all of us, and their experiences can help us transform the quality of military health care.  Doing so will be one small way of saying thank you to the men and women in the U.S. military for their service and their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 2 additional minutes to address the bill before the Senator from New York is recognized.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to address the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the bill that currently is before the Senate. I have been a strong advocate of this particular program. We, in Georgia, I think, have one of the model SCHIP programs in the country. We call it PeachCare. It provides health insurance to 290,000 uninsured poor children in my State. We cover no adults in Georgia. Every single dime that is spent on this program in Georgia is spent on children, and that is the way  it should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is one of the problems I have with the reauthorization of this bill as it came out of committee. It does three things that really bother me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, the bill that came out of committee does not take all parents off of coverage under the SCHIP program on a national basis. It does remove, over a 2-year period, all adults who are not parents of some of the children who are eligible for this particular subsidy, and that is good. The problem is, it still covers any number of adults. This is a children's program, and that is where the money ought to be spent. Every single dollar we spend on an adult takes money away from children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, under this bill, States are authorized to go up to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level for coverage. The previous bill authorized up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. In Georgia, we are at 235 percent of the Federal poverty level, which means that a family of four making $48,000 is eligible for coverage under our PeachCare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, once you reach the level of 300 percent of the Federal poverty level, you are at almost $62,000 for a family of four in income, and you are still eligible under this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I would simply say the bill out of the Finance Committee is financed by the creation of new and additional taxes. I think the American taxpayers--I do not care in what form the taxes are--are already an overburdened group of citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the standpoint of trying to find funding for this program, the Lott amendment did exactly what we needed to do in Georgia to cover all 290,000 of our  existing children who are covered, plus all who will be coming on within the next 5 years, which is the term of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott found offsets in his amendment that would not have required the raising of any taxes to cover those children. That is the type of sensible approach that should have been taken. I regret that it did not pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to support this bill in its current form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, I thank the chairman for being generous, and thank the Senator from New York for allowing me to extend my time, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from New York.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank Chairman Baucus, and I thank both Senators Dodd and Senator Chambliss for their vigorous explanation and advocacy of the bill which we have introduced that we are proposing to have as an amendment to the current legislation pending before the Senate because we think the duty to honor our veterans, our servicemembers, and their families is urgent. This is a duty we take very seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, based on the recently released report by the Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, it is a matter of grave urgency for our Nation to do everything we can to improve support for our servicemembers and veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commission found that one of the most important ways to improve that care is to improve support for families. That is why Senator Dodd and I have offered an amendment to the CHIP legislation, the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are proud to have the bipartisan support of Senators Dole, Graham, Mikulski, Chambliss, Brown, Salazar, Cardin, Menendez, Kennedy, Boxer, and Jack Reed because this is a matter that goes way beyond politics as usual. It is certainly way beyond partisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of the Dole-Shalala Commission work, they showed what many families across the country already knew, that the Family and Medical Leave Act--which Senator Dodd worked so hard on for so many years, and which was the first piece of legislation signed by my husband--has been a godsend to 60 million Americans over the course of the last years--people taking care of newborn babies, a family member with an accident or illness, caring for an aging relative. It has made it possible  for so many Americans to balance the difficult responsibilities of family and work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what has been abundantly clear--with all of our wounded warriors returning from Iraq and Afghanistan--is it has not been sufficient for family members to care for those young servicemembers who have sustained a combat-related injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, spouses, parents, and children can receive only 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. All too often, as we have now learned, that is insufficient, as injured servicemembers grapple with traumatic brain injuries, severe physical wounds, learning how to use a prosthetic, trying to understand what post-traumatic stress disorder means to them and to their futures. Indeed, family members have dropped everything. They have tried to be at the bedside, stayed in the  area to help their loved one, given up jobs even. That seems to us to be more than the sacrifice their loved one has already made demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine if your husband or your wife or your son or your daughter had been injured. You would want to be with them. You would want to take care of them. But you would not want to lose your job in the process. It is not a choice that military families should have to make. Therefore, that is why we are asking our colleagues to join with us to pass the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act, and to allow us to fulfill this duty we all feel to our military families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate very much Senator Dodd's leadership on this issue for many years, and on this particular piece of legislation. We invite even more cosponsors from both sides of the aisle to join us, and we hope we will have a vote on this legislation before we leave, before we finish the CHIP legislation, so we can go home and tell military families that help is on the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. President.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that would help address what some view as a serious problem in the underlying legislation, and what others might view as a matter of fairness in the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the SCHIP program is to provide health insurance benefits to children in families who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance. We define that criteria as families up to 200 percent above the Federal poverty line. The current Federal poverty line for a family of four is $20,650. The Federal poverty line for Hawaii and Alaska is a little higher. Two hundred percent, then, would be $41,300.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State of Texas maintains its SCHIP program consistent with the original purpose and therefore allows a family of four making $41,300 to qualify for SCHIP coverage. When my constituents see the bill before us allowing families of four making up to 300 percent of the Federal poverty line, which is $61,950, to qualify for Government-supported health care, many believe this is going too far. They certainly take issue with families making up to 400 percent of the poverty line, which would be $82,600,  receiving Government-funded health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard the supporters say that allowing coverage above 200 percent of the Federal poverty line argue that the cost of living in certain areas necessitates higher Federal poverty level coverage. One only has to utilize the various cost-of-living calculators on the Internet such as those found on bankrate.com or CNN/Money to see that a salary in one area of the country can be worth a very different amount than in another. The cost-of-living calculators adjust income by comparing the cost  of housing, utilities, and transportation, all of which have a significant impact on the actual need of the family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in this chart, you see that the cost of living in Austin, TX, would be $40,000, whereas after you add housing, utilities, and transportation, if you compare that to the cost in Washington, DC, it would be $58,697, or rather the salaries would be commensurate after you add the cost-of-living indicators in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us does not make a direct connection between the cost-of-living standards and approvals of SCHIP plans beyond the 200 percent Federal poverty line restrictions. It doesn't seem right to arbitrarily allow coverage of families beyond 200 percent of the Federal line if there is no relationship to the cost of living. If $41,300 of family income in one State is equal to a higher amount in another due to a cost of living that exceeds the national average, my proposal would accommodate  that. Why don't we say in this legislation that similarly situated families will be treated similarly. That is what my amendment would do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under my amendment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will be required to factor in the cost of living in States that are seeking to cover families above 200 percent of the poverty line. Utilizing the most recent index data from the Council for Community and Economic Research, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Secretary shall adjust the Federal poverty line throughout specific areas in those States that reflect the actual cost of living in those  specific areas. The Secretary could then approve families up to twice the new adjusted Federal poverty line, accounting for a higher cost of living in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary would break down the analysis by county or metropolitan statistical area to ensure that States with high-cost areas in some parts of the State and low-cost areas in other parts of the State would not receive the same amount. This does what I think everybody has said we need to do, and that is adjust if there is a cost-of-living increase, but not lump it State by State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of Texas, there will be metropolitan areas with a higher cost of living. So if my State wanted to go above the 200 percent, the Secretary could factor in where there needed to be an adjustment. If it were over the 200 percent in a metropolitan area such as Dallas, it might be a different calculation than if it is in a rural area, say Lubbock. This seems to me to equalize the unfairness of a whole State getting the higher rate through a waiver which the bill before us is trying to  mitigate by putting a limitation on the percent above the poverty line that a State may go, but why not do it by SMSA--the Statistical Metropolitan Area--or by county, where you can get the adjustment that is right and fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is very simple. The 200 percent of the poverty line, when adjusted for the cost of living in a specific area, could equal $45,000, it could equal $50,000, or it could be right at the poverty line. If you needed to go above it, the Secretary would be able to say in New York City, for instance, there should be an adjustment, but in upstate New York, perhaps not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is the amendment. I think this brings reasonableness, rationality, and equity to approvals beyond the nonadjusted Federal poverty limits. If you do not go above the 200 percent which is in the law, you would never have to make these adjustments. There are certainly metropolitan areas that have a legitimate claim to a higher cost of living, but it does not necessarily mean the whole State should be given that kind of adjustment, and it would be more reasonable for the taxpayers throughout  America to know that the people were getting the adjustment if they needed it, but not if they didn't.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to talk about my amendment. My amendment says that the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is designed to cover low-income children, should first cover low-income children. Many of the States today are covering nonpregnant adults and I believe this is at the expense of low-income children. This program is called the State Children's Health Insurance Program and it is called that for a reason. It is supposed to be for low-income kids. It was not intended  for nonpregnant adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment says that you cannot cover nonpregnant adults until you cover 95 percent of the targeted low-income children's population. Some States have extended their SCHIP coverage to nonpregnant adults. According to the Government Accountability Office, SCHIP covered 6 million individuals, including more than 600,000 adults in the year 2005. This means that 1 out of every 10 people covered by SCHIP was an adult. GAO indicated that in Wisconsin, two-thirds of the total SCHIP enrollees in 2005  were adults. Almost half of the enrollees in Rhode Island were adults. It also found that shortfall States are likely to cover a high proportion of adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GAO wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adults accounted for an average of 55 percent of enrollees in shortfall States, compared with 24 percent in nonshortfall States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Covering adults is not the primary purpose of SCHIP. I am seriously concerned that nonpregnant adults may be benefitting from SCHIP funds at the expense of low-income children. We need to refocus the SCHIP program to its original intent--to make low-income children the priority. My amendment today will ensure that SCHIP funds are used to provide health insurance coverage to low-income children. In my opinion, that is the intent of the original law and the way in which SCHIP dollars should be  allocated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal does not deprive States of Federal dollars. What it does say is that a State can't use its SCHIP money to provide health benefits to nonpregnant adults until it has enrolled 95 percent of its targeted low-income children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard a lot about the need to cover low-income kids, about keeping them healthy, and giving them a chance in life. If the States aren't forced to cover 95 percent of the low-income kids first, they will continue the current policies and many low-income kids won't be reached out to and brought into the SCHIP program. If we require the States to cover 95 percent of low-income kids, we will be amazed at how many of these kids the States will find.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is important for us to adopt this amendment. If we are going to expand SCHIP, let us make sure low-income children are the priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a couple of words with respect to the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. I might as well finish them now, since he spoke. Basically, his amendment means that no State, after the date of enactment, could provide for adults--childless adults or parents, parents of kids. No State. That is what this is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also point out that the standard of 95 percent is an impossible standard. No State can meet that standard. There is no State in the Nation that could meet 95 percent. We have mandatory driver's license requirements in States, and even those mandatory requirements average, nationwide, about 85 percent. That is mandatory, and we are talking about something voluntary here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So no State can possibly reach 95 percent compliance, which would mean, at the beginning of the date of enactment, all adults would be off--right now, immediately; all parents off--right now, immediately. And I don't think that is what we want to do. Why? Because the administration has granted lots of waivers to a lot of States for a lot of adults, and States are reliant on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this legislation, over a 2-year period, we are stopping that, but we give States 2 years to stop providing coverage for childless adults and for parents. States can provide for parents with those waivers, but it is written in a way to discourage the use of CHIP money for parents unless States go the extra mile and seek out more low-income kids to provide coverage for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us is a good compromise, but the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada is way too Draconian. I might also add that all experts say if you cover parents, you will cover more kids. If you don't cover more parents, you are going to cover fewer kids. There is a very strong correlation between health insurance coverage for parents and parents getting good health care for their children. Put in reverse, there is a strong correlation of parents who do not have health insurance--we  are talking low-income families here--who will not provide good health care, on average, for their kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the basis of policy, I don't think it is a good idea. It totally disrupts the compromise worked out on both sides of the aisle on this legislation. Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, myself, and Senator Rockefeller worked very hard to get a compromise here. This legislation starts to squeeze down on adults, but it doesn't cold turkey say no. That would be unfair, especially with respect to parents, because parents who have health insurance themselves will tend to provide  better health care for their kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the appropriate time comes to vote on this amendment, I think the right thing to do would be not to support this amendment because of the reasons I indicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I don't believe there is any other Senator wishing to speak right now, so I will rise in support of the amendment by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and those who put together this compromise did want to try to begin to get some control on the explosion of this program. But there are a lot of others who don't want to do that. They want it to go the other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, the administration is to blame for a lot of the problems here. They granted the waivers for these States, and they shouldn't have. They started granting waivers for higher and higher and higher income children to be covered, for adults to be covered--and not just pregnant mothers but parents and, in some States, even beyond that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said before, there is no "A" in SCHIP. It is the State Children's Health Insurance Program--for children, SCHIP as we refer to it here in this Chamber. But I do have every reason to believe there are many who fully intend for this program, the CHIP program, to be the program that covers not only low-income children, middle-income children, but all-income children and adults. That is the goal here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted for this program 10 years ago because I thought there was a need to make sure that truly low-income children had access to health care. A lot of them were not covered, obviously, by private insurance or Medicaid, and I thought there was a need to address this particular area. But it is like so many Washington programs; once they get started, they never end. And once they get started, they grow and  grow and grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who is going to help get a grip on this program? Who is going to pay for this program? This is a $60 billion, 5-year program this bill would provide for--the underlying bill. The House just passed a bill that I think is close to at least $80 billion over the next 5 years. They pay for it in the House partially by taxes but also by cutting Medicare. So we are taking elderly off of the Medicare Program so we can put more money into the SCHIP program not just for low-income children but for middle-income  children and for adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the Senator is absolutely right. Let us make sure these States provide at least 95 percent of what they are supposed to supply to the low-income children before any adults can get in it. Yes, they will have to take adults off. Exactly. They should have to. They should have never put them on there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, again, I acknowledge we are hopeful this bill will begin to get this under control. It does take away the waiver that is being used, and has been abused by this administration. But I cannot believe that Senators are ignoring the fact that this program is being exploded, covering people who were never intended to be covered, and paying for it by damaging low-income people or elderly people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad we have this amendment. If we could at least get the adults off this program, even if it does cover some increased level of children below the 200 percent of poverty, I could see that it would be more acceptable. But that is not what this does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fear what is going to happen in conference. I don't know, maybe the Senator from Montana and Senator Grassley can sit there and say, oh, no, no, no, we are not going above what we passed in the Senate. But I think the reverse is going to be true. This is the base. The $60 billion is the beginning. It is obvious, if you have a classic conference, which we are not going to have, and we are at $60 billion and the House is at $80 billion, what is it going to be? Oh, $70 billion. That is  the way it works around here. That is the way it used to work, although we don't have conferences anymore now. We dished up a product such as we had on this lobbying and ethics fiasco a while ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know how we get through this and help the people we want to help, intend to help, and keep it from covering more and more children and more and more adults. If we want to go to Washington bureaucratic-controlled and managed health care, if we want to go ahead and go to Government-run socialistic medicine, fine, this is it. This is the way it is going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years ago, there was an attempt to come in the front door and say, oh, no, we are only going to provide free health care to everybody. It failed miserably, right here. And by the way, it failed in August of that year, I believe it was 1993. Well, here we are coming through the back door this time. And incredibly, even my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle are buying this deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be back. I don't know whether I will be on the floor of the Senate, but I will be back in years to come and say, I warned you. This thing is going to continue to grow. It won't be $60 billion, $70 billion, or $80 billion, it will be $140 billion over 10, or more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the amendment Senator Ensign came up with. I support it, and I hope we can pass it. And I wish the managers good luck in trying to keep control of this thing. If you pull it off, even though I still think you have way too big a program here, I will be first in line to congratulate you if you can hold it to where it is now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator is always interesting, sometimes entertaining, but the Senator from Mississippi raised a couple of good questions. The real question is what are the answers to the questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One question is, what about adults? This is a children's program, and I think most Senators react a little adversely to covering adults. This Senator does too. It is a children's program, not an adult program. The Senator acknowledged graciously that most of the adult coverage problem is due to waivers this administration has given the States. The States want to cover adults. Why do they want to cover adults? Well, basically, because of the match rate, the money the States get under the Children's  Health Insurance Program is higher, so they want to cover adults. What we are trying to do is figure how are we going to put the lid back on this. That is what we are trying to do here. It probably gets to the question of what is a fair transition period. What is the fair way to wean the States off of covering adults?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess it is important to remember there are a lot of people, adults out in the country who are getting health insurance, and they do not know what we are debating here in Washington, DC. They do not know the difference between CHIP, Medicaid, and match rates. All they know is they are getting some health insurance. And I don't know if it is right to just willy-nilly, automatically, cold turkey cut them off entirely, because they are depending on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do think it is right, however, to wean States off this, and the States can, when their legislatures meet, figure out ways to cover adults they wish to but not on this program. That is what we are doing. That is what this legislation does. It says in the first year you can get a free ride, but in the second year your match rate is way down to the Medicaid match rate, which is basically about 30 percent less than the match rate under the Children's Health Insurance Program. A 30-percent cut will  have a real effect on a lot of these States and discourage them from proceeding further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, legislation not too long ago repealed waivers so the States could no longer apply for waivers to get childless adult coverage. So question No. 1 is, what is the right thing to do about some States adding adults? Let us not forget, 91 percent of beneficiaries under the Children's Health Insurance Program today, 91 percent, are kids under 200 percent of poverty. Today. The vast bulk are kids. So when we talk about adults, we are talking about less than 9 percent, because some States  have up to 200 percent of poverty. We are talking not too many people when we are talking about adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is kind of a philosophical question as much as anything else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the best way to put the lid back on the can, to keep States from providing it for too many adults? We think we have a fair way to do it, as I just described, a fair transition period, and that is why we negotiated out this position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Point No. 2 is, what is going to happen in conference. I have no idea. Senators know there are lots of ways to skin a cat around here. On the surface it looks like maybe if the Senate and House go to conference on these two bills--the Senate bill is much less, the House bill is much larger. They contain the Medicare provisions, physicians update provisions, and they are two different animals. When that happens, generally some other solution presents itself. That is why I say to my good friend  from Mississippi, I hear what he is saying about the views of many Senators who do not want the conference report to come back with a number that is too difficult for many Senators to swallow, especially on the Republican side of the aisle. But I also say</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our goal is to help low-income kids who do not have insurance today so a few more get it. This is not a huge, massive expansion. This has nothing to do with national health insurance, none of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are saying: Here is a program passed in 1997, it is bipartisan, Senators on both sides of the aisle like this program, there have never been any problems with it, it has worked real well, it just came up with reauthorization. The only slight problem is waivers for adults, but we are managing that. That is not a big deal. We can take care of that. So let's just reauthorize it, give it a little bump up to help a few more--not a lot, a few more kids get health insurance, and it costs a few dollars  because health care costs are going up so much in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we are helping a few kids get health insurance, at a later date, next year, the following couple of years--clearly, Congress has to address the rising cost of health insurance in this country. But as a bottom line, this is a good thing to do, to help low-income kids get some health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's remember, in the United States of America there are about 48 million people without health insurance. We are the only industrialized country with that many people without health insurance. It is an outrage. The very least we can do is help our kids get some health insurance, particularly those who are low-income kids. That is what we are trying to do in a fair and reasonable way.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wonder if the Senator from Montana will yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am honored to yield to my friend from North Dakota.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>As I understand it, this legislation is paid for. The Finance Committee reported out a piece of legislation to provide health care coverage for about 3 million more children, and it is fully paid for; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't know what is in second place with respect to what is important in people's lives, but if your children are not in the first place, something is wrong. Everybody who is a parent ought to understand the priority is your child--the children of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senator from Montana, the circumstances are that we have a lot of people in this country who do not have health insurance coverage. We have substantial problems with respect to dramatically increasing costs of health care. The fact is, we have sick kids in this country who do not get health care. They ought to get health care, but they do not because their parents do not have enough money in their pocketbook or their checkbook, and they are worried what it is going to cost if they take  their kid to the doctor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my colleagues and I held a hearing a couple of years ago, and a mother held up a poster with a colored picture of her son. He was dead. He died because he didn't get the health care he needed when he needed it. The fact is, that is happening in our country and, I say to my colleague from Montana, this is not a giant leap forward, but it is a significant step, to say we can do this. We can help children. We can provide health insurance for children who do not have it. We can fully pay for  that bill, as the Senator from Montana has done, and his colleagues in the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleague, this is not a health insurance bill that is going to cover all Americans, that is going to dramatically expand, is it? Isn't this just a piece of legislation that takes a step forward in saying to 3 million kids that the days they are sick, no longer will their parents have to make a decision about whether they can afford to take them to a doctor? Isn't that what this is about?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senator is correct. But not only is it 3 million, it is 3 million low-income kids.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I might further inquire, that answer means these are kids who come from families who do not have the resources?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>And they usually do not have health insurance because they can't afford it, even if their employer provides it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further inquiring, in circumstances where they might believe they have no choice, they don't have any money, and they have a desperately sick child, they are going to show up in an emergency room. If that emergency room doesn't turn them away--and some will--that child will get the most expensive or the costliest health care because that is where it costs the most to provide health care--in the hospital emergency room. That is why this approach is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hear people say, what a radical thing to do, what an awful thing to do. This ought to be considered a baby step forward, but an important baby step, nonetheless, in doing what we are required to do in this country. Again, that is putting our children first, especially putting sick children first, sick children who come from families that do not have the money to find a way to get them to the doctor. That is what this is about. This ought to be a no brainer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final question, if I might. We have been on this for a while, and it has been a wide open discussion, and  there have been a lot of amendments. I believe we have four or five additional votes scheduled at 4:30 today. I would like to inquire, what next? What do we anticipate? How many additional amendments might exist?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can work through this. It is a bipartisan bill. It makes so much sense. What does the Senator from Montana anticipate after the next batch of votes?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I expect, frankly, the Senate will finish tonight, late tonight, and get this legislation passed--as well it should. In addition to the five amendments pending beginning at 4:30, there could be at least about 10 more later today--maybe a package about 8:00, another about 10 o'clock, something like that. My hope is some of those will not all be offered.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is important to finish the bill tonight. It is a bipartisan bill with strong support. It is a matter of giving everybody an opportunity to offer their amendments, which we have done. At that point I think it will be a significant achievement for all Americans, what we have done for poor, sick children in this country. I thank my colleague from Montana for the leadership he and Senator Grassley and so many others have shown on this bill. This is a very important step for  this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I say to my good friend, this is not a new program. We are just reauthorizing a current program. It is not new.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How many children are covered under this program?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Currently, there are about 6.6 million children covered.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As I understand it, this would add several million children?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>About 3.3 million, roughly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>About 3.3 million, and there are already 6 million. I am wondering if they are suggesting this program should be eliminated, which would mean 6 million children currently covered would no longer be covered?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Actually, the Senator is making another point, which is about 6 million kids are eligible today under the current law but just are not covered. So we are saying we are not increasing the eligibility, we just want to help give a little stimulus so those who are currently eligible but not covered--a few more of them will be covered by health insurance.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is it my understanding the American Medical Association has endorsed this legislation?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senator is correct. There are many medical associations that support this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Does the Senator know of anytime in the history of this country where the American Medical Association has endorsed socialized medicine?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't know if I want to answer that question, because I can think of one major bill that many thought was socialized medicine but they now strongly support.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just say the argument being made out here is one of the most far-fetched arguments I have seen on this floor; No. 1, that this is somehow socialized medicine. Isn't this care provided by private doctors?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is a very good point. I might say, this legislation received endorsements from over 50 different organizations, major organizations--AARP, pharmaceutical companies, the American Medical Association. This bill has wide endorsements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senator has just implied--yes, this program says: OK, States, you figure out how you want to administer it. It is up to you, the States, not Uncle Sam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most States say we are going to utilize health insurance companies, private health insurance companies to administer this, with copays and deductibles, and so forth.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>The fact is, this care is provided by private physicians using private insurance companies, endorsed by the American Medical Association and many other national organizations, including many business organizations; is it not?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct. This legislation also provides assistance for States to provide--the fancy term is "premium assistance"; that is, to help families pay the insurance companies.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the core issue is the repeal of the 1993 alternative minimum tax rate increase. The alternative minimum tax was put into effect in 1969 in order to catch people who paid little or no taxes; people in high brackets who had sufficient loopholes to avoid taxation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, it has grown by bracket creep to be very expansive. In 2006, it covered 3 1/2  million people. If it is not changed, it will cover 23 million people this year. The tax was increased in 1993 from 24 to 26 percent for people making under $175,000, to 2 percent more for people in the upper bracket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a matter that can be explained in a minute. It is a tax which never should have occurred, and now we can correct it for the people in the lower brackets.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I very much share the concerns of the Senator from Pennsylvania, I think every Member of this body does. That is, no one wants the Americans who currently do not pay the alternative minimum tax to have to pay it next year. They will have to unless this body, this Congress, makes the appropriate change in the adjustment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am fully committed to finding a solution so anybody who has not paid alternative minimum tax in 2006, when he or she files their tax returns next April, does not have to pay it for 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a good solution. Frankly, with this solution by the Senator from Pennsylvania, many more Americans are going to have to pay the AMT; it is not paid for, it is at a cost of about $420 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 201 of the Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Finance Committee's proposal reauthorizing the SCHIP program for 5 years is funded by a permanent tobacco tax increase. That is a $35.2 billion expansion of SCHIP, which is above the $25 billion in the baseline budget. The money for this comes from a cigarette tax increase of 61 cents to $1 per pack. There will be a tax increase on cigars by 53 percent, with the sales price up to $10 per cigar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite being a 5-year reauthorization, the tax part of it goes in perpetuity. So it is a very simple amendment. When the program itself is sunset to be reviewed, let's sunset the tax part of it to be reviewed. That is all it is.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It says we should focus on low-income kids before adults. The original intention of the program was the Children's Health Insurance Program. This says 95 percent of all of those targeted--whether they are 200 or 300 percent of poverty; whatever your State is--they have to be covered before you can cover nonpregnant adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Finance Committee is going to say no State can meet this. Well, if we don't set the goal for them and don't make them meet it, they won't meet it, of course. So if we are going to have a Children's Health Insurance Program, the money should be focused on the children. This says you cannot spend money on the adults unless they are pregnant adults until 95 percent of those targeted kids are enrolled in the program, and that is where the money is spent. I urge the adoption of  the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a poison pill. The effect of it is to kill this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator is correct, no State can meet 95 percent. No state currently meets 95 percent. Driver's license participation, which is mandatory and not voluntary, is 85 percent. Participation in Medicare Part D, which is voluntary and not mandatory, is only 56 percent. There is no way in the world any State can meet a voluntary compliance rate of 95 percent, so this is a killer amendment. It kills the bill. It ostensibly applies to adults, but it kills the bill. I urge Senators not to kill the  SCHIP program and vote against the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me start by saying this amendment is not a poison pill. By voting for this amendment, it doesn't impact any other part of the legislation, except to limit the expansion of SCHIP in the following ways:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show you how expansive in nature this bill is, this bill would not prevent a State, such as New York, from going to the 400 percent of Federal poverty level, which in New York is about $82,000, which, interestingly enough, would subject over 12,000 people in New York--taxpayers--to the alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, essentially, what we are saying is you are poor enough to qualify for SCHIP, but you are wealthy enough to be subject to the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment says that for children or adults from families with incomes so high they are going to be subject to the AMT, they cannot also be eligible for SCHIP. Families should not be considered low-income for the purpose of receiving taxpayer-funded health insurance and, at the same time, wealthy enough to have to pay the alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office scores this amendment as achieving savings because there will be fewer people qualifying for SCHIP than otherwise under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This helps us get back to the original intent of the bill, which is to cover low-income children, which I strongly support. I hope Members will support the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator raises two issues, the AMT and this legislation. They are two entirely separate, independent issues. We will deal with the AMT at the appropriate time, not on this bill. The AMT is a huge problem. This Congress and the committee are going to, as sure as I am standing here, make sure we have some kind of AMT patch so taxpayers who did not pay the AMT tax in 2006 will not have to pay it for 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not try to solve the AMT problem on the backs of the low-income kids. It is wrong, dead wrong. I strongly urge Senators to keep first things first. This is a kids bill, not an AMT bill. We deal with kids today and help low-income kids and we will deal with the AMT at a later date. Believe me, we will find a solution to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Senators to keep their eye on the ball with kids and not to support the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my amendment says that the program is implemented as long as no more than 20 percent of the beneficiaries are crowded out of private insurance; in other words, no more than 20 percent of the beneficiaries already have private insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the problem: The Congressional Budget Office says that between 25 and 50 percent of the people who are going to be covered under this program already have private insurance. What is worse, every one of the newly eligible is already insured. In other words, CBO says 100 percent of the newly eligible, the people we are adding to this program, already have insurance. Now why should the American taxpayer have to pay for people who already have insurance?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Surely, in response to the argument of the other side that it is as efficient as we can get, we can be more efficient than 100 percent inefficient. My amendment says that when we get it down to only 20 percent inefficiency, then the program takes effect; in other words, when only 20 percent of the people we are paying for already have insurance.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is plainly, simply, clearly a killer amendment. There is no way in the world that CBO can certify 20 percent crowd-out. They cannot do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many organizations trying to figure out what is the so-called crowd-out rate. They are all over the lot. It is almost impossible to tell what it is. That is the reason for the big range to which the Senator referred. The one to one is not accurate. If you read the CBO table closely and go down to the next line, you will see it is much less, about one-third under the table. There is no way CBO can certify this. It cannot happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this amendment is adopted, you are basically saying no State can have a Children's Health Insurance Program. This is clearly a killer amendment. We should not kill the Children's Health Insurance Program. We should help more kids get health insurance, kids who are not now getting it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am so pleased to be here today, offering this amendment to affirm this body's commitment to move forward with health care reform in the small group and individual markets this year. We certainly know our focus here is on children. We want it to be. We know that is a priority. We know if we take things one step at a time, we do a much better job at it, so we are glad to be here working on children's health care and the availability and accessibility to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we are also excited with the group of Members who have expressed their concern about the small group market, those of our small businesses and our self-employed, and the real concerns and needs they have in terms of access to health insurance. As is evident from this distinguished list of cosponsors joining me in offering this amendment, it is an extremely important issue, one that Members across the political spectrum in this body are committed to addressing in the coming months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know this week has been about children's health care, and rightly so. But we must not get ourselves into believing we are nearly done, because we are not. Much more work is required of us to ensure all Americans have access to affordable and quality health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are now approximately 45 million Americans without health insurance. In my home State of Arkansas, 20 percent of working age adults are uninsured. Additionally, more than half of our uninsured workers are employed by businesses with less than 25 employees or are self-employed. These small business employees are almost always in a small group and individual health insurance market, where similar coverage usually costs more than it would in a large group market. Actually, they end up without  anything, in terms of health insurance, because it becomes so costly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Addressing this problem must be a national priority. That is why we have come together as a group. Those who lack health insurance do not get access to timely and appropriate health care. They have less access to important screenings and state-of-the-art technology and prescription drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a new problem and none of us see it as that, but it is a growing problem and it is one that we must address and we must begin to start to find the solution, the solution using new and innovative ideas to this age-old problem. I, along with each of these distinguished cosponsors on this amendment, have been working for a long time, trying desperately to make progress on this issue. We have not all approached it in the very same way, and, no, we have not necessarily seen the same path  to a solution, but that is all right because what is important is that through this amendment we are recognizing and affirming our responsibility to come together in a bipartisan way, to use our individual expertise and perspectives, and to find a workable solution that is going to move the ball down the field and start providing real relief for our working families in this great country this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take a moment to thank my partners on this amendment. I thank them for their determination to move forward in a bipartisan fashion, to make real progress on health insurance reform, specifically for small businesses and the self-employed. I thank them for all their tireless efforts, because each person in this cosponsorship list has taken a tremendous amount of their time over the past several years to devote attention to this critical issue: Senator Snowe, who is on the Senate Finance  Committee and also on the Small Business Committee; Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member GRASSLEY have been wonderful, in the midst of all the things they have been facing, to work with us as a group to talk about what we can and cannot do in the Finance Committee; Senator Ben Nelson, who has a tremendous history in dealing with this</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of work to do. I look forward to rolling up my sleeves, along with each of these cosponsors and each of our colleagues, to make the small businesses and the self-employed working families of this country a priority, as we have the children of this Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from Arkansas, my friend Senator Lincoln, to speak on a separate but overlapping issue related to the challenge of providing health care coverage for the 9 million uninsured American children. Our colleagues Senators Baucus, Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch have forged a bold agreement to cover millions of children through the SCHIP program, the health program for our kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, another problem remains. These children, by definition, live in households that have not been adequately covered by the private market. In fact, of the 45 to 46 million Americans who are currently uninsured, over 80 percent are employed. These people get up every day and work hard to support their families and keep our economy moving forward but are left praying their family doesn't face a bankrupting health crisis. Fifty percent of these Americans work for small businesses with fewer  than 24 employees. The small business workforce is especially important in my State, and I know it is critical for many of my colleagues from other States as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the hard work which has gone into SCHIP, and I intend to vote for this important package. But I am also glad we have the opportunity to show our commitment toward providing market-based relief, which will afford additional coverage for the remaining uninsured Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is indeed one of our country's greatest challenges. I look forward to turning our focus to solutions for small business, alongside the leaders of the Finance and HELP Committees who have joined us today. I thank the floor managers for affording us this time. I am encouraged by the progress made today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the best ways we can help millions of American children access quality health coverage is to lower the cost of insurance for their families. Two-thirds of the uninsured have income at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, and they cite a lack of affordability as a top reason for why they do not have coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Tax Code already discriminates against Americans whose employers do not offer health benefits. I applaud a number of my colleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Burr, and many others, who have talked on the floor extensively about how we can equalize the Tax Code and make health insurance available to everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another driver of rising health insurance prices is excessive State regulation. These State mandates raise the cost of insurance, which, in turn, increases the number of Americans who are priced out of the health insurance market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current law traps Americans by only allowing them to buy health insurance in the State where they live. This is not fair, and it makes very little sense in a time when we are trying to lower the cost of health insurance. My amendment, which we call the Health Care Choice Act, will help millions of American children by allowing their parents to shop for health insurance the same way they shop for many other products: online, by mail, over the phone or in consultation with an insurance agent in  their hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will empower consumers by giving them the ability to purchase an affordable health insurance policy with a full range of options. This amendment would reform the individual health insurance market by allowing individuals and families who reside in one State to buy a more affordable health insurance plan that is offered and licensed in another State. That is an important point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not talking about insurance that is not licensed. Every State has regulatory processes, and insurance products would have to be sold under one of those regulatory regimes in one of our 50 States. Health insurance plans would be able to sell their policies to individuals and families in every State, as other companies do in the sale of a wide variety of goods and services in other sectors of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this amendment, consumers would no longer be limited to picking only those policies that meet their States' regulations and mandated benefits. Instead, they could examine the wide array of insurance policies qualified in States across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumers could finally choose the policy that best suited their needs and  their budget without being tripped up by State boundaries. This approach would provide more choices and more freedom to all Americans. If they want to purchase a basic, low-cost policy without hundreds of benefit mandates that they do not need, they will be allowed to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, those Americans who are interested in a particular benefit would be allowed to do that as well. The Health Care Choice amendment will help the uninsured find affordable health insurance while also providing every American with better insurance choices. This amendment harnesses the power of the marketplace to allow Americans to tailor their insurance choices to their individual needs. That is something we should all be able to support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Heritage Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, this amendment will broaden and intensify competition across health care plans and medical providers,  encourage a serious review of existing health care regulations in every State, and expand the choice of millions of Americans of more affordable health insurance policies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Absolutely.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">

    <paragraph>I certainly agree. I thank the Senator for bringing this to the attention of the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the question. I appreciate the support of the Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In New Jersey, the average cost for a single person to buy health insurance is over $4,000 a year. Right across the river in Pennsylvania, the average is less than $1,500 a year. This amendment will give consumers the option of buying the health insurance that meets their needs and is right for them, even if it is right across the border. This amendment will result in significant cost savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent study found that consumers would save an estimated 77 percent in New Jersey, 22 percent in Washington, 21 percent in Oregon, and 16 percent in Maryland, if those States eliminated some of their mandates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will also be cost savings from cutting redtape because insurance plans won't have to go through 50 different certification processes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By mandating benefits, State legislators have swelled the number of Americans without health insurance, making each health policy's coverage very different. They have added things such as acupuncture and marriage therapists and in vitro fertilization, things that may be important to some people but not to everyone. They should not be mandated to everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this amendment is widely supported by Americans across the political spectrum. A poll conducted by Zogby International in September of 2004 found that 72 percent of respondents support allowing an individual in one State to buy health insurance from another State, if the insurance is State regulated and approved, as it would be under this amendment. The poll showed that only 12 percent of Democrats opposed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People understand intuitively that it doesn't matter. As the Senator from Mississippi just said, it doesn't make sense that we limit people to buying health insurance in only one State.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is one that certainly cannot be accepted. Essentially, it allows insurance companies to race to the bottom, race to the State with the lowest level of standards of insurance regulation, to market and sell in any State, irrespective of what the standards would be in the other States. I don't think that is good policy. I understand what the Senator is driving at but certainly not tonight. Without a closer examination of what our State insurance regulation  policies should be, this is not the time to get into this issue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="TRAGEDY IN MINNEAPOLIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Klobuchar, and I wish to thank our colleagues in the Senate for their thoughts and prayers for the victims in the almost unconscionable tragedy that struck our State yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We just returned from the scene of an unprecedented disaster in our State's history. As my colleagues have watched on the news over the last 24 hours, one of the busiest bridges in Minnesota--the I-35W bridge near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis--collapsed into the Mississippi River yesterday evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mississippi is not just a river in Minnesota; it is our identity. Right near where the bridge went down, in 1680, Father Louis Hennepin, the first European in the region, first spotted the Falls of St. Anthony. A few years earlier, he "discovered" Niagara Falls as well. As the head of navigation of one of the world's great rivers, the Falls of St. Anthony became the focal point for Minnesota's lumber, textile, and flour-milling businesses that put us on the map.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Minnesotans have visited the spot far upstream in northwestern Minnesota, where the "Mighty Mississippi" is a little stream, flowing out of Lake Itasca, that you can walk across. It is why we call ourselves the Headwaters State and pride ourselves of being a place of invention and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when the bridge came down 24 hours ago, part of Minnesota's soul fell with it as well. Having visited the site firsthand today, there are three things I would like to join Senator Klobuchar in asking of our colleagues, our fellow Minnesotans, and all Americans this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, and most importantly, please keep the victims of this tragedy and their families in your thoughts and prayers. The courage of the first responders and other citizens who joined together last night in the noblest of rescue efforts will receive our unending respect. Unfortunately, our mission is no longer rescue but recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The days ahead will be incredibly difficult for the families of the victims of those who we know have already left us and the many more who remain missing. For comfort in this time of unspeakable tragedy, we implore each and every one of you to honor their loss by keeping them near to your heart and in your prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, let us acknowledge the skill, coordination, and courage of those responding to the scene of this horrific event. I was the mayor of St. Paul, Minneapolis's twin city and proud neighbor, when we experienced the tragedy that will define our era--the attacks of 9/11. I remember the challenges we had with communication, with logistics, and with overall preparedness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the State of Minnesota learned the lessons of preparation that day and set out to ensure that if any major emergency should happen again, we would be ready. Mr. President, you hope that day never comes, but yesterday it came for the "Mill City."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Governor, Mayor Rybak, Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek's office, other local first responders--police and fire--and hundreds of Twin City residents responded in a manner which those of us who witnessed will carry with us forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Klobuchar and I saw the living definition of heroism and leadership today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw and heard stories of bystanders linking arms to pull victims from submerged automobiles, rescue divers braving the dangerous current of the Mississippi to reach vehicles beneath shredded concrete and jagged steel, and the faces of moms and dads reunited with their children after their miraculous escape from a trapped schoolbus. These images will reverberate across our State for years to come, and we owe all those who contributed to those stories of survival our eternal gratitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as we move forward in the coming days and weeks, let us commit ourselves to rebuilding this critical artery in our heartland and to protect against another tragedy such as this from ever occurring in our great Nation. This process will take time, energy, and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, it is absolutely critical we begin a comprehensive evaluation of our Nation's infrastructure immediately. The one thought many of my colleagues have conveyed to me over the last 24 hours is the fear this could have happened to any bridge in their home State or hometown. We need to make sure it never will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to rebuild. Our Federal Highway Administration operates a program to assist in this type of disaster, providing emergency relief for Federal highways in the wake of tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Governor made a request today to the Secretary of Transportation. Senator Klobuchar and I will join the entire Minnesota delegation in working with the Department of Transportation to transfer this funding as quickly as possible. My colleague will talk a little bit about some of  the details of what we are asking. We need, in sum, to make the funding as expeditious as possible. We have some legislative hurdles we believe we can correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced a bill to waive the cap on emergency highway funds that can be transferred in such a scenario and to allow those funds to be used to help transit routes and facilities in the meantime, as an interim measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not have much time to rebuild in Minnesota. The construction window is extremely small because of our difficult winters. We need to pass this waiver before we recess, hopefully, tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Minnesota has come to the aid of other States in their time of disaster, we are going to need a lot of help in our home State. I am happy to hear from around this Capitol and throughout the administration that help will be coming very soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must wrap our arms around those who have lost and grieve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be the temptation to turn pain and agony and suffering into anger and blame. Unfortunately, blame will come--responsibility for this tragedy may lie in many places--but I ask all of us today, let prayers and support be the order of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our obligation and commitment to the victims of the horror of yesterday's tragedy must be to recognize that we can no longer put off our commitment and obligation to our Nation's infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to that cause on behalf of Minnesota and reach out to my colleagues to ask you to join with me in making that commitment to all of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At one of the darkest moments of the American Revolution, George Washington wrote these words in a letter:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Minnesota are writing a new chapter in that American story in the aftermath of one of the worst disasters my State has ever seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to be a Minnesotan today, and I look forward to what I trust we will accomplish together tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Minnesota.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="TRAGEDY IN MINNEAPOLIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Coleman, for those fine words and for his description of the history of the Mississippi River, which is such an important part, as he noted, of our State's history. But for me it is personal. I live only 8 blocks from where this bridge buckled under. This is a place where every day I drive with my husband and our 12-year-old daughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I looked down at that bridge, when I stood on the side and saw that schoolbus barely hanging to the side of that fallen concrete, I thought of those drivers, I thought of those other moms with their kids in the backseat--that on an August day, maybe they were going to a Twins game or maybe they were driving home from work--and never did they expect that a massive eight-lane interstate highway bridge would suddenly buckle to the ground. That is what we saw when we went there this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the other thing I saw that I come back to tell the Nation is there are little miracles every day--the miracle of that schoolbus, where kids from a very poor neighborhood in Minneapolis were sitting and somehow saved, and acts of heroism. People saw on the news the woman diver who went in and back in and back in, without any safety equipment on, among the concrete and the shards looking for survivors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a disaster that no one expected, but it was something our city and our State had planned for. We learned the lessons from 9/11, and we had many practices for these kinds of disasters. I was the former prosecutor for this area. I remember meeting with the sheriff and the police chief and we planned these drills and we went through them. You could see the results today. You could see the lives that were saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we got in today and drove on this highway, there were actually billboards--actual billboards--already up telling people how to get around the scene. There were actually 24 buses added to the transit service, already, at 6 a.m. in the morning and advertised in the newspaper so people could get to work. This is going to be a model as we go forward for how to handle national disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mississippi River starts in Minnesota. In fact, you can walk across it by Lake Itasca, as Senator Coleman noted. But then you go down and it gets bigger and bigger and pretty soon it ends in New Orleans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think about what happened today, I think of a much bigger and more massive disaster with Katrina and how that was handled and how people in Washington responded. In some ways, I always think of those people stranded on those roofs. I think the mirror of those people was a reflection of leadership and a lack of leadership. We are not going to let that happen in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know this is not the massive disaster of Katrina. But it is a huge mess, and it involved a loss of life. So we are coming together, bipartisan, with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Senator Reid is fully behind this. Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, Senator Murray--they all talked to me already this morning, and they pledged their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we have proposed, working with Senator Coleman--we are working together on this--and working with the Republican leadership, is we get a bill passed tonight to at least authorize a lifting of the cap so we can move forward for emergency disaster relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think this is also a reminder, as we go forward, that we have to invest in our Nation's infrastructure. We do not know what the cause of this disaster was. One thing I learned as a prosecutor is, you do not come to conclusions unless you know the cause. But this is a reminder that we need to invest in our long-term infrastructure, and we need to have those emergency funds in place, because a bridge such as this in the middle of America should not fall into a river on an August day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to get to the bottom of this and we will rebuild this bridge and we will rebuild this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our prayers are with the families, our thoughts are with the rescue workers. We thank them for working throughout the night. We thank our hospital personnel and our firefighters and our police officers and the ordinary citizens who were walking by--it is right in the middle of the University of Minnesota campus--and dove into that river to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was the true spirit of Minnesota, and the world watched last night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, and I thank my colleagues for their support and all the help they have given us as we move forward. This is going to be a long process. It is not going to end tonight. Our goal is to get this bridge rebuilt and to get our city moving again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as my colleagues have stated, we have to make health insurance more affordable. One thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on is that there are inequities in the tax treatment of health insurance. We all agree that Congress should level the playing field and expand access to health insurance; the question gets down to how.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proposals which have been introduced so far include the President's proposal, which includes a standard deduction for health insurance. Senator Burr, Senator Coburn, Senator Martinez, Senator Corker, and Senator Dole have formally introduced a tax credit proposal. Each proposal contemplates eliminating the exclusion for employer-provided coverage to meet this end. Currently, a taxpayer who receives health insurance through his or her employer is not  taxed on the cost of the health coverage. Individuals who do not receive health coverage through their employer and are not employed and purchase health insurance on the individual market generally do not receive a tax benefit. As we just discussed, this problem is most acute in the small business context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Wyden and Senator Bennett are also interested in fixing the health care system and making health insurance more affordable. Their proposal also contemplates amending the Tax Code for that purpose. I commend Senators Wyden and Bennett for their work in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to ask Senator Burr if he would take an opportunity at this time to comment on this and explain where he is coming from, and then I will call on Senator Bennett.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for, as a key member of the Finance Committee, acknowledging the fact that it is time we treat all Americans the same; that if you give a tax break on one side, you should give a tax break on the other side; that you should treat everybody alike. I think we approach this in a bipartisan way with Senator Wyden and Senator Bennett, and though we disagree about exactly how to implement it, this is tremendous progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman described the difficulty we have today and the challenge in front of us, I think all of us say: When are we going to fix it? Today, we are on the floor talking about an expansion for uninsured children. What we are attempting to do is  to take care of the whole uninsured population. Through refundable tax credits, which I believe reach all Americans--not some and not just those with incomes that have tax deductibility at the end of a  calendar year but all Americans--I think we accomplish that commitment to say we want to go out and make sure every American has coverage. We want to make sure they have the resources to go in the private marketplace and negotiate coverage that reflects their age, their income, their health condition. We want health care to be portable so you are no longer locked to an employer because of health care. We want individuals to have the capacity to take it with them, regardless of where they work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We propose that once we reach tax equity, every individual in this country would receive annually a $2,160 refundable flat tax credit, and every family would receive a $5,400 annual refundable flat tax credit, more than enough money to cover the tax consequences of a benefit that is not treated as wages, and for any extra money that is left over if you are on employer plans, it would be deposited in a health savings account where those additional funds could only be used for health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For individuals in the market today who don't have coverage, all of a sudden we have provided the money for them to go into the marketplace and to negotiate coverage for themselves or for their families. That check would go directly from the U.S. Treasury to the insurer that is providing that coverage. If there is something left over from their tax credit after they have negotiated for coverage, it would go into their health savings account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are maximizing the amount of dollars just by treating Americans the same--not by giving one special favors and others being deprived of that but saying we are going to treat all Americans the same. Then, an amazing thing happens: We no longer have a debate on uninsured Americans because every American has the opportunity through that--it is not under the Government plan--to receive that refundable flat tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may be at home saying: This really doesn't apply to me. But it does because when you eliminate the uninsured in this country, you eliminate the cost shift each one of us who has health insurance today pays for. I tell my colleagues that the cost of every American's health insurance will come down if, in fact, we solve this problem once and for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the commitment from the ranking member of the Finance Committee is an important first step for us treating the tax side of this in an equitable fashion, and I look forward to working with our other colleagues on exactly what the solution is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300007" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I apologize for my voice. Some people may say I need a little health care, but, in fact, I am in good shape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee for his diligence in this situation as well as his attention to this issue over more than a decade. As a very freshman Senator in 1994, I participated in the debate we had on comprehensive health care that ended up in a situation President Clinton described in his State of the Union Message the following year. He said: Last year, we almost came to blows over health care, and he wanted to know why we couldn't get together on bipartisan  lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the ranking member of the Finance Committee has signaled his willingness to get together along bipartisan lines. Senator Wyden, a member of the committee, has talked to me about this, and I have been more than happy to join with Senator Wyden, and I thank him for his statesmanship and his willingness to deal with this question in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Burr has talked about how universal coverage--the term Republicans always used to hate to use--is now a legitimate concept. Universal coverage used to be code word for a single-payer, government-run system, which Republicans opposed. We now understand that everyone in the country should have access to health care so that the cost shifting Senator Burr talked about can stop and the debates over what can be done for the uninsured can stop, and it can be done if we change  the tax laws in an intelligent way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our tax laws for the coverage of health insurance go back to the Second World War. I think the economy has  changed sufficiently since the Second World War that we can recognize that the tax laws need to be changed. Senator Wyden's leadership on this issue, opening up the question of how we can use tax credits now to achieve what Democrats have wanted to achieve for a long time, which is universal access to health care, and at the same time provide what Republicans have wanted for a long time, which is real market forces in health care, to me is an idea whose time has come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am looking forward to the opening the ranking member of the Finance Committee has suggested, where the Finance Committee can have hearings on this issue when we come back after August. I know that will require the cooperation of the chairman of the committee, and I am not being presumptuous to try to suggest what the schedule should be. But I am grateful that the conversation is taking place, that the recognition that hands must be joined across the aisle to deal with this question that  has been raised, and I look forward to participating in the debate in any way that I can be helpful.</paragraph>

Certainly, Senator Bennett and Senator Wyden, Senator Coburn, Senator Burr, and Senator Martinez and a number of people have joined in this debate, and we have spent a great deal of time talking about the important health care bill, the one we are voting on right now tonight. But the fact is, we all know we need to reform health care so that we have equal tax treatment,  so that people have the opportunity to actually buy private health insurance and choose the physicians of their choosing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can continue to have these short-term fixes--we now have a fix that takes us through 2012 on this program--or we can have reform that really works. I appreciate the chairman and the ranking member having hearings for us to be able to talk about this in a real way. I hope what has happened with Senators Wyden, Bennett, and Burr, and Senators Coburn and Martinez and others, including myself, is that hopefully we will have an opportunity to have a  real debate on health care reform so that we can really move toward what this country ought to do, and that is to make sure Americans have the opportunity for affordable, quality health care, and we can move beyond these short-term solutions we are faced with today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Florida is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to rise also to speak on this issue. It is very important that we talk about children's health care, as we have been doing over the last several days, but it is equally important that we talk about all Americans. In the State of Florida, 17 percent to 20 percent of the people are uninsured on any given day. That is unacceptable. We as a country have to deal with this issue. I want to deal with it in a way that allows for there to be tax equity, for one thing,  for those who purchase health insurance through their employer and have tax equity for those who choose to buy a single individual policy of their own. We need to find a way through the tax credit program we have introduced with this bill so that we then make it possible for people to buy health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the goal is not to create a single-payer system, to create a government-run system--which we know is not ideal and which we know has not been the way to provide the greatest and best care--but to provide a way for people to become insured and for those  who cannot afford it to have an opportunity through the Tax Code to get the help they need so they can purchase it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there are a lot of good ideas we need to discuss, a lot of debate that needs to take place. At the end of the day, I don't think we should fear a discussion, and we should not fear the possibility that we all are coming to a consensus on the idea that all Americans have to have a place where they can go for their health care. A lot of health care dollars can be saved if people have that kind of maintenance and care all along so that they are not only going to a health care facility  in a crisis, in a medical crisis. We would save a lot of dollars in the end, and the quality of life of the American people would increase as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member for his courtesy and yield the remainder of my time to him.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I just want to make two points on the Every American Insured Act, and that is that every American ought to have access to health care, and if we do that, the average American's health care policy right now would go down $1,000 a year. There is over $250 billion in cost shifting that is in the system today that will go away. We ought to be thinking about that. We ought to be looking at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do know from around the world is that a true competitive market will yield the best quality and the best results and the best outcomes for every American.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the underlying intent of any of these proposals is to put downward pressure on insurance costs, thereby reducing the cost of health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress goes in the direction of a tax credit, the tax credit must be structured so that low-income individuals have a meaningful tax subsidy to purchase health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress goes in the direction of a standard tax deduction, any deduction must be structured to ensure that taxpayers who continue to receive health care coverage through their employer do not see a significant increase in their taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should also contemplate a combination of a tax credit and a deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A combination effectively marries these tax concepts and may serve as a viable compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Senate Finance Committee should hold hearings on the various ways we can reform the health care system. We may even be able to mark up a proposal that could be acted upon by this body before the end of the year.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Arizona is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is only about 17 minutes before voting starts. I have an amendment I would like to speak to for 4 or 5 minutes. If there is not somebody else who needs that time right now, let me do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This relates to an amendment that will be, I believe, the last one we vote on in this next tranche that simply reinserts into the code the very minimum wage tax provisions the Senate voted on and approved. It was--if not unanimous, it was a very strong vote in favor of those provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recall that when the minimum wage bill was dealt with in the House, they originally had a bill, but they ended up putting it in the Iraq supplemental appropriation because that was a must-pass bill. So the minimum wage provisions were attached to that bill, and they passed but without all of the Senate-passed tax provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are literally debating tonight came from the House of Representatives and is that tax bill. Now, we have amended it to include the SCHIP provisions, but what we need to do is to use that House shell bill for its original purpose, also, and that is to add back the exact provisions we passed in this body to help small businesses offset the costs of the minimum wage requirements we imposed upon them. They have to do with depreciation for leaseholds, restaurants, and for some retail construction.  I will explain what each of them is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leasehold restaurant renovation provision, under current law, leasehold and restaurant improvements and renovations are depreciated over a 15-year period, but that only applies through the end of this year. What we did here in the Senate was to extend that treatment through the end of 2008--very reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New restaurant construction. Current law requires that components of a new restaurant be depreciated over as long as 39 years, if you can believe it. It doesn't make sense to depreciate restaurant renovations over 15 years but new construction over 39. So what the Senate did was to fix this inconsistency and provide for the same appreciation, a 15-year period, and to extend that again through the end of the year 2008. This applies to things such as convenience stores. A direct competitor of a  quick-service restaurant can use the 15-year depreciation schedule for all construction, and it is permanent in our Tax Code. If you have a different kind of restaurant, you don't have that same tax treatment. The Senate recognized that inconsistency and put that into the law and extended it until 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, an owner-occupied retail. Improvements made to that were depreciated for as long as 39 years. The Senate recognized that owner-occupied retail space is not renovated and maintained as often as leased space. So our minimum wage bill provided a 15-year recovery period for improvements made to owner-occupied retail spaces. We extended that same treatment through the end of the year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is those three provisions, which we passed in this body--I think they are all supported by members of the Finance Committee--are not law only because they got dropped in the very bill we are debating today that came over from the House. It is, therefore, the perfect opportunity for us to put them back in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure my friend, the chairman of the committee, will say this is the wrong bill to do it; this is the SCHIP bill. Well, I say we should not have put the SCHIP bill on the tax bill. We should use that tax bill for its original purpose--to have the House have to pass the same tax provisions we passed. We have to deal with these expiring provisions sometime this year. Right now, they expire at the end of this year. We have to do it. We might as well do it in the very bill it was intended to  be done on right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There may be a commitment to do all of these so-called extender provisions sometime before the end of the year. When we come back in September, things are going to get pretty dicey with the issues relating to foreign policy and, ultimately, probably tax bills such as AMT relief. We have the FAA reauthorization and all these other things, with time running out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason we cannot do it now. I suggest that we do it. All this amendment does is extend the current law provisions for restaurants and leaseholds through the end of 2008--the same thing we would be doing with the usual extender package--and adding the new restaurants construction and owner-occupied retail space to the 15-year depreciation category, as we already did when we passed the minimum wage bill in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember, we have now imposed the minimum wage burden on small businesses, and they are going to expect some relief so they don't have to bear all of the expense of it. They expected that relief. They are not going to get it if we are not able to extend it before the end of this year. This is the place to do it. I hope my colleagues, when they get to this last amendment, No. 2562, relating to depreciation for retail and restaurants and construction, will recall that they have already supported  this once before. We have this commitment to our small business constituency, and I think this is the perfect vehicle for us to ensure that that relief actually gets to them and that they, therefore, can take advantage of it beyond the end of this current year.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will be very brief. The amendment has been accepted by the leadership on the Senate Finance Committee. We have been talking a lot about health care. We have a lot of health care in our country, but, unfortunately, not enough prevention or wellness.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a fairly straightforward amendment. I am not sure what the chairman thinks about it. One of the things we know--even from the chairman's words earlier--he rejected the CBO evaluation of the new enrollees in this system. What we do know is that a large number of children who now have insurance with their parents are going to be moved out of that insurance to somewhere else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the old SCHIP program, we had a concept of premium assistance. In the two States that have gotten through the very tough parameters of that assistance and have met it to meet the requirements of SCHIP, we found fewer kids go away from their parents' insurance and stay unified in the same clinic, with the same doctors, with continuity of care. And 77 percent of the children between 200 and 300 percent, which is what we are addressing with the new bill, are already covered. For the fully eligible  kids up to 200 percent, CBO tells us for every one we add, we will take one off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment says let's not take them off. Let's use the money for premium assistance to help those parents keep the insurance with them. In Oregon--and the Senator from Oregon might know this--those families who chose the premium assistance option were more likely to receive care in a doctor's office or HMO, rather than a public health clinic or a hospital clinic. Families using the premium assistance option also reported fewer unmet primary and specialty care needs than those in traditional  SCHIP. The premium assistance option works. We need to remove the difficulties and barriers so that more individuals eligible for SCHIP have the freedom to access it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring that newly eligible populations under the Baucus-Grassley proposal are covered with a premium assistance model will ensure the preservation of market-based health care, rather than decline that system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many lower income families already participate in the private health insurance market. Seventy-seven percent, as I said, of those in the 200 to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level are already covered in a private insurance market. So if the purpose of SCHIP is to get kids covered and we are worried that some in this group--those at 200 to 300 percent--why not use premium assistance to help them stay in a contiguous family policy and help the parents maintain them within that policy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We accomplish the same goal and we do a couple other things. No. 1, we let parents make a decision on who their doctor is going to be for their child, rather than a Government bureaucrat. In many SCHIP programs, there is a limited number of providers, and the child may not be seen now. What this does is use the funds to allow them to stay with their parents, still reaching the goal of covering more kids; but, also, CBO has scored this amendment as saving money because we will cover more children  at a lower cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fairly commonsense amendment. There are problems with the requirements on the premium assistance model in the old SCHIP program. As a matter of fact, four other States had gone to it and then left because of the complications of getting the waivers and meeting the requirements of the SCHIP, which forced children away from the primary care doctor they and their parents wanted to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one other thing that I think is important. Whether we like to admit it or not, 60 percent of the primary care doctors in this country don't take SCHIP or Medicaid. So we have limited it down to 40 percent. If we want to have equal access for these children under the SCHIP program, we need to take the Medicaid SCHIP stamp off their forehead. We need to give to them the market so they can go where they want to go. By doing premium assistance, you allow that freedom of choice by the parents  of the children. When we don't allow premium assistance, we take choice away--here is what I had and now I don't have the choice. I submit to the body that this will discourage a large number of children from going into the SCHIP program. So if our goal is to increase it from 200 to 300 percent, and over 77 percent of those are already insured, why would we not want to keep those already insured and do a premium assistance model and help the other 23 percent with the SCHIP program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a straightforward amendment. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Amy Finkelstein recently released research about the unintended effect of what happens when the Government controls health care. The summary of that is we pay more, but we don't get better results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I showed a chart here the other day, actually, of the  fully absorbed cost of us buying insurance through the SCHIP program versus what you can buy in the private market. The difference is astounding. It is about $1,800 more to buy a $1,352 policy versus the other.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, America spends 16 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, and that doesn't take into account any research and development. It is important to know that, through the private sector, M.D. Anderson, in Texas, spends more on research than the entire country of Canada. We don't want to disrupt that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So keeping these children in a private program with their parents, with the continuity of care, I can tell you that as a practicing physician, when you have one child go one place and one child going somewhere else, and a parent going somewhere else, the ability to access health care declines. So I hope the chairman will consider accepting this and look on it favorably. We will actually make the Baucus-Grassley bill much more effective, much like we are seeing in Oregon, which has been effective  with children staying on the same health care with their parents.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is not wise. I do not think we should adopt this amendment. What does the amendment do? Basically it would require at least 34 States would have to resign their successful Children's Health Insurance Programs in ways that force children into potentially inferior coverage; that is, their health insurance coverage would be worse than under SCHIP. Why? Because sometimes private health insurance requires deductibles or limits hospital stays, may prevent insulin from  being available for diabetes. It forces premium assistance. It forces people into coverage they may not want. I don't think we want to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it would force children to take the premium assistance to purchase HSAs. That is not a good idea. HSAs work better for wealthier Americans, healthier Americans. We are talking about low-income kids, and they have to spend a lot of money on high-deductible HSAs. I don't think it is a good thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here to help kids. We are not here to force kids into private coverage plans and use their premium assistance to buy HSAs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the amendment not be agreed to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I note a couple points. This does not force any kid, 200 percent or under, to go into the premium assistance program. A family making $62,000 a year--that is not a low-income kid. As a matter of fact, 21 States in this country have less income than that. It is working well where it is being utilized, and it does not force anyone into inferior care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand the chairman's objection. I take that, but the record should show that of those who are on premium assistance today, they have adequate or greater care than the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, since the Senator took an extra minute, I ask to respond and then get to the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially, this amendment forces kids to use premium assistance in two negative ways. One, it forces them into private coverage. They may not want it because the private coverage might be worse. Second, this amendment has the effect of forcing premium assistance to buy HSAs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to encourage it at this point because HSAs are better for the healthier and wealthier and not low-income kids. I urge the amendment not be agreed to.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is also a crowding-out issue, which I think is a very important and central issue in this debate. I am for a safety net. I am for insuring children who aren't insured, who can't get health insurance otherwise. What I am not for is pushing kids who are on perfectly solid ground off that solid ground and into the safety net. That is what, in part, this very large SCHIP expansion would do, perhaps 50 percent of the new SCHIP enrollees being folks--kids--who have private  insurance. Now, that is wrong and it is also very expensive to the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment does is simple: It says we are for a safety net, but we are not for pushing people who are on solid ground into the safety net. And if they have difficulty staying on that solid ground in terms of affording their premiums, we are going to allow States to have premium subsidization, premium support to be able to keep those folks on good private insurance. That is what we should do, rather than push people off solid ground into the safety net at great taxpayer expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I don't think we want to do this. This requires--it mandates--that States deny kids coverage under the program if their employer offers health insurance. It requires it. I don't know where we have those kinds of requirements today in the health care area. Senior citizens are not required to sign up for Medicare Part B. There is no requirement. Why should we require States to prevent children's health insurance coverage if by chance the child's family is offered private  health insurance? The private health insurance may be inferior to what the child would otherwise get in the program. The benefits might be much less. Who knows what doctors are available. Who knows?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think we want to require States to prevent families and low-income kids from getting CHIP coverage simply because an employer offers health insurance. That is not a fair choice. I think we should, therefore, reject the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment simply has us do something we have already done.

You will recall they attached the minimum wage bill to the Iraq supplemental, and they dropped out these tax provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment simply reinstates the same tax provisions for small businesses in three areas: leasehold and restaurant depreciation, extending them from the end of this year through 2008; new restaurant construction, a 15-year depreciation period; owner-occupied retail, a 15-year depreciation period--all just through the end of the year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As to the first one, it has to be done this year because it expires at the end of this year. As I said, we adopted this. We checked the record. I think it was by unanimous consent. In any event, I believe it was unanimous. We already passed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the irony. The underlying bill that the SCHIP bill has been attached to is that minimum wage bill.

  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, may I read this before he objects? I wonder if my colleagues would indulge me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is the outgrowth of a bill I introduced with Senator Kohl this year. As many of my colleagues know, Congress modified the Supplemental Security Income Program to include a 7-year time limit on receipt of benefits for disabled refugees and asylees. This policy was intended to balance a desire to have people who immigrate to the United States to become citizens, with an understanding that the naturalization process also takes time to complete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the naturalization process often takes longer than 7 years. Applicants are required to live in the United States for a minimum of 5 years prior to applying for citizenship. In addition to that time period, their application process often can take 3 or more years before resolution. Because of this time delay, many individuals are trapped in the system and faced with the loss of their SSI benefits. In fact, we know that to date, more than 7,000 elderly and disabled refugees have  lost their SSI benefits and another 16,000 are threatened to lose their benefits as well in the coming years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these individuals are elderly refugees who fled persecution or torture in their home countries. They include Jews fleeing religious persecution from the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing from Saddam Hussein's regime, Cubans, and Hmong people from the highlands of Laos who served on the side of the U.S. military during the Vietnam war. They are elderly and unable to work and have become reliant on their SSI benefits as their primary income. To penalize them because of delays encountered  through the bureaucratic process is unjust and inappropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration in its fiscal year 2008 budget acknowledged the necessity to correct this problem, this injustice, by dedicating funding to extend refugee eligibility for SSI beyond the 7-year limit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation builds upon those efforts by allowing an additional 2 years of benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, asylees, and other qualified humanitarian immigrants, including those whose benefits have expired in the recent past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, benefits could be extended for a third year for those same refugees who are awaiting a decision on a pending naturalization application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These policies are limited to 2010 and are completely offset in cost by a provision that will work to recapture Federal Government funds due to unemployment insurance fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offset that is provided was also taken from the President's own budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By reducing fraud in the unemployment insurance system, the provision would effectively reduce taxes on employers by $326 million over the next 10 years, according to the CBO estimate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for listening. I hope for your support and ask that this amendment be accepted by unanimous consent.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I have talked about this amendment today, I have been surprised that several colleagues were not aware that Americans are not allowed to buy health insurance, except in the State where they live. Americans can buy anything from all over our country. Yet they are limited to where they can buy health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One way we can lower the cost of health insurance and create more choices for all Americans is to allow each and every American the opportunity to buy a health insurance policy in any State where those policies are certified. Some will say this is a race to the bottom. But I ask those critics, which State does not have the regulations that you approve of? Every State legislature has a set of regulations they have approved. So these products would be safe, but they create more choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment that would allow Americans to buy health insurance all over the country, to help create a national market and make health insurance more affordable for every American.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment effectively eliminates State insurance protections. The States with the least regulation would become the home of private health insurers who sit back and watch a race to the bottom.

It is totally opposed to the current system, where each State has its own insurance  regulations. One can argue whether that is a good system, but that is what it is.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill seeks revenues for the very laudable State Children's Health Insurance Program by unfairly taxing tobacco products. I urge my colleagues to acknowledge the reality that this tax increase is an irresponsible and fiscally unsound policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tobacco sales have been declining 2 to 3 percent per year and are expected to be slashed by another 6 percent if the Federal excise tax is increased. But in order for this tax increase trick to work, more than 22 million additional Americans will need to take up smoking to keep the SCHIP program running over the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, according to the Tax Foundation, no other Federal tax hurts the poor more than the cigarette tax. Of the 20 percent of the adult population who smoke, around half are in families earning less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. In other words, many of the families SCHIP is meant to help will be disproportionately hit by the Senate's proposed tax hike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose this tax hike plan not only because it is fiscally unsound but also because it unfairly hurts the economy of my home State of North Carolina. A massive and highly regressive tax increase on an already unstable product is an irresponsible way to fund such an important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 203 of the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution makes it out of order for the Senate to consider legislation that increases the deficit by more than $5 billion in any of the four 10-year periods starting in fiscal year 2018 through 2057. The pending substitute amendment would increase the long-term net deficit in excess of $5 billion. I, therefore, raise a point of order under section 203 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con.

    <paragraph>I want to express my appreciation for the chairman's efforts, and those of Ranking Member GRASSLEY, in working to ensure the health and well-being of our Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman knows, more than 1,700 schools offer on-site, comprehensive well care, illness-related care, and dental care to nearly 2 million students from rural, suburban, urban, and Native American communities where access to such care is limited or nonexistent. A recent article in the March issue of Health Affairs discusses the role of school-based health centers as  an effective means of helping children get the care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was prepared to offer an amendment to the pending Children's Health Insurance Program bill that would ensure that school-based health centers are recognized as a provider under both Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. While the vast majority of these centers receive Medicaid reimbursement, only one in four receives reimbursement under the Children's Health Insurance Program for the providing the exact same quality services that a child might receive at another provider.</paragraph>

You have taken a very difficult and contentious issue and produced legislation that will help many families. You should be congratulated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to raise the issue of diabetes as part of the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I have offered an amendment along with my colleague Senator Dorgan, which would reauthorize the Special Diabetes Program for Indians and the Special Funding Program for type 1 diabetes research. This amendment is identical to the language in <bill type="s" number="1494">S. 1494</bill>, which I also introduced with Senator Dorgan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diabetes is one of the most serious and devastating health problems of our time. Although diabetes occurs in people of all ethnicities, the diabetes epidemic is particularly acute in our Native American populations. That is why during the negotiations on the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, the same bill that created this SCHIP program, I helped craft an agreement to finance diabetes programs of the Indian Health Service and help raise the profile of tribal health programs. The Special Diabetes Program  for Indians began with funding of $30 million annually for 5 years and was later expanded to $150 million a year. This funding has been used widely in Indian country, including among the Navajo Nation and the 19 Pueblos in New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These programs are set to expire in 2008, and I believe they need to be a priority in this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank the Senators from New Mexico and North Dakota for their leadership on this important issue. I have worked hard in previous Congresses to support this program and helped shepherd its last reauthorization as part of the 107th Congress. It is important that we work together to make sure our Native American and rural communities have the resources they need to provide treatment and prevention programs. It is important to support research to work to find a cure for this  disease. Although we were not able to include this provision in the bill that is before us on the floor, I am aware that these critical programs expire in 2008; and that the reauthorization of these programs is a priority for the Finance Committee.</paragraph>

I support the reauthorization of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians and also the reauthorization of the Special Funding Program for type I diabetes research. The prevention and treatment of diabetes has improved greatly over the past decade. These programs  have clearly played a major role in these improvements.

    <paragraph>Mr. President. I voted against the Allard Amendment for the following reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment sought to codify in law the treatment of unborn children, therefore establishing the fetus as protected separately from the mother. Under the current bill, SCHIP States may treat pregnant mothers. In 2002, the Bush administration issued a regulation that gave States the option of extending SCHIP coverage to unborn children without a waiver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support the waiver policy in the pending legislation, this amendment is an effort to advance a political cause rather than provide a medical necessity because pregnant women are now covered. Under current law, there is ample ground for coverage during pregnancy. In fact, the Senate bill allows States to provide coverage for pregnant women without denominating them as unborn children to advance a political cause.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate adopted a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that small business owners should have some help when it comes to providing health insurance for their employees. I am an original cosponsor of the resolution adopted by amendment and strongly support its goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current health insurance system is simply not working for small employers and the self-employed. Employees of small businesses are much more likely to be uninsured than employees of large businesses. They are charged higher premiums for similar coverage. Their premiums can increase dramatically from year to year when a fellow employee gets sick. And employees rarely have a choice when it comes to their health plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past several months, I have sought out the opinions of people with a variety of viewpoints, which has resulted in constructive dialogue on how Congress can respond to these challenges. We are making progress. I think a workable compromise can be found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is general agreement on what we want to accomplish. We need to create opportunities for small businesses to group together in a large pool. We need to ensure there are choices in private health plans that employees can choose from. And some form of subsidies will be needed to make health coverage more affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what we need to put in place, and we are working on how to reach these goals. The resolution demonstrates the Senate's commitment to finding a consensus this year. We won't end up with a Democratic bill, and we won't end up with a Republican bill. It will have to be a bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to work together, take the best ideas that are offered, and develop  a proposal that has bipartisan support. That is the only way this Congress can address the need to help small business manage rising health care costs, while making health care coverage available for their employees.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is debating the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. This is a vital safety net program that offers health care coverage to one of our most vulnerable populations, low-income children. I support a timely, fiscally responsible reauthorization of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SCHIP program has served a critical purpose for many years. In 1997, Congress created SCHIP to come to the aid of the millions of children who were going without health insurance because their families were stuck between earning too much money to qualify for Medicaid and not having enough money to purchase private health care coverage. I was pleased to join many of my colleagues in supporting its establishment. Thanks to this program, low-income children have been able to count on a safety  net program that can provide them with health care coverage that they might otherwise go without.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support the central purpose of SCHIP and believe that children of low-income families should have health insurance coverage. In some ways, this program has been a great success, as we have been able to drop the rate of uninsured children by nearly 25 percent from 1996 to 2005 and SCHIP covered about 6.6 million children last year. At the same time, however, I am greatly concerned that the program has expanded beyond what Congress first intended. In some cases, SCHIP coverage has been  extended to middle-income children and to certain adult populations. I don't believe that was the intention of Congress when we created this program. This has complicated SCHIP reauthorization, and I believe that if we allow SCHIP to grow beyond its original purpose, SCHIP spending will grow exponentially and jeopardize its future success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several options have been proposed to reauthorize the SCHIP program. One, the CHIP Reauthorization Act, which was reported by the Finance Committee, would greatly expand SCHIP beyond its original framework, lead to an explosion in new spending, and reduce private health coverage in our country. The other, the Kids First Act, which I support, would keep SCHIP's focus on providing low-income children with health insurance in a fiscally responsible manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned over the direction that the CHIP Reauthorization Act would take SCHIP and the precedent it would set for future authorization bills. The current SCHIP baseline is currently $25 billion; however, under the Finance Committee's proposal, spending would explode by an additional $35 billion and will end up costing $60 billion over 5 years. Not only that, according to CBO, at the end of 5 years, in order to comply with pay-go rules, this bill reduces the SCHIP allotment in the fifth  year 2013 from $8.4 billion to $600 million. If there is anyone who seriously believes Congress will cut SCHIP funding by $8 billion in 1 year and cause millions who would then rely on SCHIP to lose coverage, I have got some beachfront property in Yuma, AZ, that I am willing to sell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CBO report also points out that if the costs of the program continue to grow according to enrollment projections, the total cost of the program over the fiscal year 2008-2017 period would be $112 billion. Even the massive tobacco tax increase included in the bill, which would raise about $71 billion from fiscal year 2008-2017, can't cover that cost. I am not sure where the extra money will come from to cover the cost of the bill, and it is unfair that we leave this for a future Congress to  figure out how to cover our overspending. In other words, let's put a halt to business as usual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHIP bill also represents a change in the mission of SCHIP by further eroding private health coverage of children. With expanded eligibility for SCHIP, we are likely to see families who already have private coverage drop that coverage and opt for a Government-run, Government-subsidized program. CBO estimates that, among newly eligible populations covered under this bill, each additionally enrolled individual in SCHIP will be matched by one individual leaving private coverage. We will be spending  billions and billions of dollars providing coverage for children who already have coverage, and I believe this is a dangerous step toward Government-run health care insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, Congress should remember the central mission of SCHIP and focus the program reauthorization on providing low-income children with health insurance coverage if they don't otherwise have it. Several of my colleagues offered the Kids First Act as a substitute amendment to the CHIP bill. It would reauthorize SCHIP, provide an increase in funding, and avoid a costly regressive tax increase. This bill would ensure that SCHIP mission remains covering low-income children and will focus efforts  on enrolling children who are already eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid but are not currently enrolled. It also recognizes that millions of children receive private health coverage and would improve current laws that allow States to offer premium assistance for coverage through private plans. Additionally, the Kids First Act also includes small business health plan reforms. Unfortunately, the Kids First Act failed after it was offered as an amendment during debate earlier this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I cannot support the CHIP Reauthorization Act. While I applaud the sponsors efforts to reauthorize SCHIP, I believe that bill differs drastically from the original intention of the SCHIP law and is fiscally irresponsible. I support the ideas contained in the alternative bill, the Kids First Act, which I believe would keep SCHIP focused on providing health insurance coverage to low-income children and would do so without dramatic increases in Federal spending or higher taxes on Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Children's Health Insurance Program has reduced the number of uninsured children by one-third since its enactment in 1997. The administration's opposition to this legislation is a vital mistake that threatens the health and well being of our Nation's children. This program is not partisan and debate on this issue should not be ideological. We simply want children to have access to health care. Making investments in the health care of  children will help ensure that they grow up into healthy adults. In order to learn and lead active and healthy lives, children must have access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As of June 2007, 17,512 children were enrolled in Hawaii's Children's Health Insurance Program. An estimated 5 percent of children in Hawaii do not have health insurance. This is approximately 16,000 children who do not have health insurance. I am proud that my home State, Hawaii, has continued to develop innovative solutions to help increase access to health care. This year, Hawaii enacted legislation establishing the Keiki Care Program. The Keiki Care Program is a public-private partnership  intended to make sure that every child in Hawaii has access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is not the time to cut Federal resources provided to States to provide health care for children. The legislation currently before the Senate will preserve the access of health care for the 6.6 million children currently enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. It will also expand health care access to an estimated 3.2 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act must be enacted. This administration's opposition to this program is shortsighted and threatens the well-being of our Nation's children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to not only the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, but also to the expansion of this successful program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIP was created a decade ago on a bipartisan basis with the support of a Democratic President and a Republican Congress. Members of both sides of the aisle came together to address the problem of uninsured children across this country. In 1997, over 22 percent uninsured low-income children were uninsured. In 2005, that percentage had  decreased to less than 15 percent. It is clear that CHIP has significantly lowered the percentage of low-income children  that are uninsured. Overall, CHIP has led to a one-third reduction in the percentage of low-income uninsured children in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIP covers a total of 6 million children today, and research shows us that these children are doing better than those without insurance. CHIP kids are more likely to have seen a physician, and to have had a well-child visit than uninsured children. They are more likely to receive hospital care and prescription medications for their health conditions. Most importantly, CHIP kids have better health and academic outcomes, such as improved care for asthma; declines in infant mortality, childhood  deaths, and low-birth weight; and improved academic performance. These facts make it clear that our bottom line should not be dollar amounts, but the health and success of our children, and it is clear that children enrolled in CHIP are healthier and doing better in the classroom. I see no greater reason than that to expand this successful program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIP is a national success story that we should all take pride in. Unfortunately, it is one the few success stories that we have to report in health care over the last decade. Health care costs are rising at ever increasing rates, employer sponsored coverage is decreasing, the numbers of uninsured is rising, health care quality is not where it should be given the amount we spend on health care, and patients are not involved enough in their own care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As families, businesses, and providers confront these realities, Washington is in a deadlock about how to solve one of our most daunting domestic challenges. CHIP, however, offers this Congress another opportunity to reduce the number of uninsured children in this country now. Just as importantly, we have an opportunity to also make an investment in our future by improving the health status of our Nation's children. It is imperative to our Nation's future health security to provide these children  with the coverage they need to be healthy and productive for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that members of both parties want to cover uninsured children in their States and across the country. Members of both parties want CHIP to function as efficiently as possible and to reach those most in need. Members of both parties want to provide States with flexibility to address their States' unique concerns. Now, we are all faced with a new challenge--to cover the 9 million children that remain uninsured across America, 6 million of whom are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. This challenge  brought a core group of Senators from the Finance Committee together around these common goals, which they used as a foundation for reauthorizing and expanding this successful program to move towards covering all of the 9 million uninsured children that remain in this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both sides worked tirelessly together and compromised so that the legislation we are now considering could be brought to the Senate floor and so that we could move towards bringing health security to more of America's uninsured children. If enacted, this legislation would provide coverage to over 3 million more children, again reducing the number of uninsured children by one-third. States would receive new funding for reaching out to eligible children and enrolling them. States will also receive  funding based on their spending projections, thereby reducing the likelihood of budget shortfalls as we have seen increasingly in recent years. States will receive incentives to lower the rates of uninsured children in their State. Lastly, States will continue to have the flexibility</paragraph>
    <paragraph>program. This legislation also establishes a new framework for improving quality, which should be a priority as we consider ways of containing health care costs, by creating a quality initiative to develop, implement, collect measurement data on quality of care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there are some in the Senate that are opposed to this legislation and to the expansion of this program. This week they have spoken extensively on their proposals for health care reform and their willingness to move forward on that larger issue. However, while we wait to reform the health care system in this partisan environment, children in this country are living without access to health care. We have a moral obligation to care for these children and give them the best chance to succeed  in school, and at life, by keeping them healthy. There are others that say the program should be expanded even more significantly. While I agree with this latter sentiment, the nature of the work of this body is bipartisan. To progress, we each may have to give something up to our colleagues. I urge them to continue on this course and support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before this Senate body is the product of months of bipartisan negotiation, compromise, and a shared vision and goal across both parties. CHIP reauthorization should be an example to all in this Chamber of what can be accomplished when we put partisanship aside and focus on what we have in common.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of all, I urge the President to not veto CHIP reauthorization if a bill were to reach his desk. It would signal a colossal missed opportunity to provide health security to those that are most vulnerable in our Nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or what folks on Capitol Hill are calling S-CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP was created by a Republican Congress in 1997 to help low income kids get health insurance. The goal of the program is to help kids that don't qualify for Medicaid, but also can't afford to get health insurance on their own, receive the care they need. This program expires on September 30, 2007, and I am here today to speak about how important it is to reauthorize this critical program in a way that protects private health insurance and keeps kids healthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to speak for a few minutes about the how the program works today and how the proposals the Senate is discussing will change what currently happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently States have three options: they can enroll kids in Medicaid, create a new separate program, or devise a combination of both approaches. SCHIP is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the States, and States receive a higher percentage of Federal money for their SCHIP beneficiaries than they do for their Medicaid beneficiaries. This was originally designed to encourage States to create SCHIP programs. States have 3 years to spend their SCHIP allotments. Funds that aren't spent  within 3 years are usually redistributed to States that have spent their allotment and need additional money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Republican-led Congress enacted SCHIP in 1997, the program authorized $40 billion for 10 years. I will come back to this point in a bit, but the underlying bill before us today authorizes $60 billion over 5 years--the baseline spending is $25 billion over 5 years and this bill authorizes an additional $35 billion over 5 years. The budget resolution contained a deficit neutral reserve fund to spend $50 billion over 5 years in addition to the $25 billion in the baseline, so a total in  the budget resolution is $75 billion over 5 years. This is a lot of money and Congress needs to ensure the money is being used to pay for health insurance for kids that don't currently have health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that Senator Baucus' bill will reduce private coverage--that is kids will move from private health insurance to taxpayer-funded public health insurance. This is a highly inefficient policy--especially given how bureaucratic some State programs are structured. This is not an efficient use of the taxpayer's money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the reason why the crowd out effect is so great under the Finance bill is because the bill allows States to expand coverage to kids up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty level--which by the way translates to an annual income of $82,000 for a family of four. The higher the income expansion, the greater the crowd out effect. This is simple economics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I would be remiss if I didn't mention what a great job my home state of Wyoming is doing in administering SCHIP. Wyoming first implemented its SCHIP program, Kid Care  CHIP, in 1999 and in 2003, Wyoming formed a public-private partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming and Delta Dental of Wyoming to provide the health, vision, and dental benefits to nearly 6,000 kids in Wyoming. These partnerships have made Kid Care CHIP a very successful  program in Wyoming. All children enrolled in the program receive a wide range of benefits including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, lab and x-ray services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse services, durable medical equipment, physical therapy, and dental and vision services. Families share in the cost of their children's health care by paying copayments for a portion of the care provided. These copays are capped at $200 a year per family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wyoming is also engaged in an outreach campaign targeted at finding and enrolling the additional 6,000 kids that are eligible for Kid Care CHIP but aren't enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congress works to finalize a bill to reauthorize this program, it is essential that we focus on the kids first. Some states SCHIP programs cover parents of kids that are on SCHIP and some States even cover childless adults. Adults without health insurance are a problem in this country, but not a problem this program was originally intended to address. I think there are responsible, market-based things Congress can do to help more American adults get health insurance, but this bill, the State  Children's Health Insurance Program, should focus on the C for Children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only does this bill need to focus on kids, we need to focus on low income kids. In July 2005, Wyoming's Kid Care CHIP began covering kids up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level--those with family incomes below $42,000. The median family income in the United States is about $46,000, so the Wyoming benefit is very generous. Some of my colleagues are advocating for expanding SCHIP to cover kids and adults at 400 percent of the Federal poverty level. That means families making as much  as $82,000 a year would have their kid's health insurance paid for by the government. Again, this is an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. Why should the government provide health care for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>kids that come from families making $82,000 a year? I'll tell you why my colleagues are advocating for it--they see this as the first step toward government-run health care. They want the U.S. to be more like Canada and Great Britain. They want to take the private sector out of health care. They want to put the government in the exam room and tell you what doctors you can see and when you can see them and what drugs they can prescribe for you. I don't believe in this. Not only do I not believe  in this, I think this goes against all the principles upon which this country was founded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I do agree that our health care system is breaking down, and in fact I don't think we have a health care system, I think we have a sick care system. That is why, earlier this month, I introduced "Ten Steps to Transform Health Care in America," a bold and comprehensive solution that addresses our health care crisis by building on market based ideas to expand access to health insurance for all Americans. I would like to take just a little bit of time to discuss each of Ten Steps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first of the Ten Steps is eliminating unfair tax treatment of health insurance, expanding choices and coverage and giving all Americans more control over their own health care. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that removing this tax bias and a few related health care tax policies will save the Federal Government $3.6 trillion over the next ten years. That is a lot of money that can and should be used to expand choices and access and give individuals more control over their health  care. Ten Steps ensures every American can benefit from this savings--whether they get their health care from their employer, from the individual insurance market, or they decide they want to get off Medicaid and switch to private insurance. Everyone should be treated equally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second step of Ten Steps would increase affordable options for working families to purchase health insurance through a standard tax deduction. The national, above-the-line standard deduction for health insurance will equal $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for an individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third step of Ten Steps is what makes this a hybrid approach--I couple the standard deduction with a refundable, advanceable, assignable tax-based subsidy. The tax subsidy is equal to $5,000 for a family, $2,500 for an individual. The full subsidy amount is available to individuals at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level, FPL, which is $20,650 for a family of four. The subsidy is phased out as an individual's salary increases, with individuals at 200 percent receiving half of  the subsidy and individuals at 301 percent receiving the standard deduction instead of the subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fourth key step for health care reform is to provide market-based pooling to reduce growing health care costs and increase access for small businesses, unions, other kinds of organizations, and their workers, members, and families. Those of you who know me well recognize how central this would be to any health care reform proposal of mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fifth step blends the individual and group market to extend important HIPAA portability protections to the individual market so that insurance security can better move with you from job to job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sixth step emphasizes preventive benefits and helps individuals with chronic diseases better manage their health. America should have health care, not sick care. Prevention. Prevention. Prevention. This step is modeled after a very successful program in Wyoming. In 2005, Wyoming EqualityCare, our Medicaid Program, began providing one-on-one case management for Medicaid participants with a chronic illness, such as diabetes, asthma, depression, and heart disease, to encourage better self-management  of these conditions. The program provides educational information on self-management as well as a nurse health coach that follows up with each patient to ensure they have what they need to take care of themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The seventh step gives individuals the choice to convert the value of their Medicaid and SCHIP program benefits into private health insurance, putting them in control of their health care, not the Federal Government. This is very pertinent to the underlying bill we are discussing today. The rationale for this step is simple. If the market can provide better coverage at a lower price, then why not allow Americans to access that care? This gives low-income individuals more options about where they  receive their care</paragraph>
    <paragraph>and what care is available to them. It is time for people to start making decisions about their care--let's get the government out of the doctor's office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The eighth step in Ten Steps is a bipartisan proposal which the HELP Committee approved last month--the Wired for Health Care Quality Act. This bill will encourage the adoption of cutting-edge-information technologies in health care to improve patient care, reduce medical errors and cut health care costs. Some of the most serious challenges facing healthcare today--medical errors, inconsistent quality, and rising costs--can be addressed through the effective application of available health information  technology linking all elements of the health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ninth step of Ten Steps helps future providers and nurses pay for their education while encouraging them to serve in areas with great need. The ninth step also ensures appropriate development of rural health systems and access to care for residents of rural areas and gives seniors more options to receive care in their homes and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final step decreases the sky-rocketing costs of health care by restoring reliability in our medical justice system through State-based solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize that I have talked for quite a bit about Ten Steps to Transform Health Care in America and that, the underlying legislation is the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I believe it is important to think bigger than just one program and think about the health care system as a whole. I have spoken a few times on the Senate floor about what I call the 80/20 rule. I always believe that we can agree on 80 percent of the issues and on 80 percent of each issue,  and that if we focus on that 80 percent we can do great things for the  American people. I believe that if we work together on these proposals we can find that 80 percent. I would like to work with my colleagues on that 80 percent.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud that we have produced a bipartisan bill to continue to provide health care insurance to children of low-income parents. The Children's Health Insurance Program, which we created 10 years ago, has been a great success, but it is set to expire on September 30. This bill to reauthorize and expand the program deserves our strong support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the President to approve the bipartisan compromise my colleagues worked so hard to achieve and not to carry out his threat to veto a bill, a veto which could result in denying health care coverage to many uninsured children from working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a children's health insurance program under title XXI of the Social Security Act. This program allows states to insure children whose families are above Medicaid eligibility levels through block grants, and it allowed states flexibility in designing how CHIP would be implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1997, CHIP has received about $40 billion in appropriations and has been widely successful. Currently, 6.6 million children are enrolled in CHIP. Seventy percent of those children came from families with incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level, and more than 90 percent were from families with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIP coverage leads to better access to preventative and primary care services, better quality of care, better health outcomes and improved performance in school. Some experts estimate that families with insured children are five times less likely to delay health care because of costs than families with uninsured children. Michigan has had particularly impressive results from CHIP and currently has the second lowest rate of uninsured children in the nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although CHIP has been successful, it still fails to address the problem fully. Too many children qualify for the program but are unable to receive insurance because of inadequate funding. There are still 9 million uninsured children nationwide, 6 million of which are eligible for either Medicaid or CHIP. In Michigan, while 55,000 children are covered under CHIP, 90,000 Michigan children are currently eligible for Medicaid or MIChild, Michigan's CHIP program, but are not receiving services. In  addition, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the recent decline in employer-sponsored health care coverage is threatening the access to private health care coverage for many more children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With CHIP set to expire this year, the path we need to take is clear we need to reauthorize and to also expand CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill before us was reported by the Senate Finance Committee with a bipartisan majority of 17-4. It will reauthorize CHIP and increase funding for the program by $35 billion over 5 years. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 would ensure that there is sufficient funding to cover the children currently enrolled and to expand the program to additional children in need. This plan would increase outreach and enrollment for uninsured low-income children of the working  poor, enhance premium assistance options for low-income families, and improve the quality of health care for our Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization would also provide $200 million in grants for states to improve access to dental coverage; require that states providing mental health services provide those services on par with medical and surgical benefits under CHIP; and allow states to use information from food stamp programs to find and enroll eligible children. This bill would also help to reduce racial and ethnic health care disparities by improving outreach to minority populations and provide new funding for state  translation and interpretation services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The additional $35 billion in funding is expected to reach an estimated 3.2 million additional uninsured American children from low-income families. Up to 50,000 more Michigan children would be covered over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two aspects of the bill that are disappointing. The current CHIP program allows for flexibility at the State-level in how the program is implemented. The administration has encouraged this flexibility by approving waivers to some States that would allow them to cover services to other needy populations after ensuring that it is not at the expense of enrolling eligible children into CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michigan has had a waiver that allows it to cover adults who make less than $3,500 a year--adults who are the "poorest of the poor." But under the bill we passed today, some of these waivers will be phased out</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second disappointment is that this bill does not go as far as we could have to fund and expand CHIP. In the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution, the Senate included an increase of $50 billion for CHIP. However, the bill, as a result of compromises made, provides $35 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted for an amendment offered by Senator Kerry that would have provided the additional $15 billion that would have taken us back to $50 billion. With this additional funding, the Kerry amendment would have provided more incentives to increase the enrollment of uninsured children. Unfortunately, this amendment was not agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On balance, however, this is a strong bill. President Bush's approach would be far worse. The President wants to add only $5 billion over 5 years, which many believe will not even sustain the current levels of coverage and certainly would not help the millions of children still living without health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has threatened to veto the Senate's CHIP reauthorization bill, but I hope the Senate's action today will send a strong message to the President that this program has broad bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are just a few examples of the way in which CHIP fills a need. A courageous and hardworking mother from Royal Oak, MI, wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a single working mother, I could not afford the family insurance that my employer offered, and definitely could not afford private pay. Without this insurance I do not know what I would have done. [SCHIP] offered us options, doctors instead of emergency rooms, less time missed at work and school. Please continue and increase funding for this valuable program. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A registered nurse from Berkley, MI wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I work in Detroit with impoverished, uninsured and underinsured adolescents and the SCHIP program has helped tremendously in getting them the health care they so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And a registered nurse from Pleasant Ridge, MI, wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an imperative to continue to support, and expand, health care services to children. These services are the building blocks of personal health leading to healthy, active adults. Health promotion and disease prevention programs have been shown to save significant healthcare dollars later in life by assuring that each individual grows and develops to their fullest potential. Healthy children become healthy adults who then support the growth of communities and the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation to provide Americans access to affordable and high quality health care. No person, young or old, should be denied access to adequate health care, and the expanded and improved Children's Health Insurance Program is an important step toward achieving that goal.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the first bills that I sponsored when I came to the Senate 10 years ago was the legislation that established the State Child Health Insurance Program--or SCHIP--which provides health care coverage for children of low-income working parents who cannot afford health insurance yet make too much money to qualify for Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1997, SCHIP has contributed to a one-third decline in the uninsured rate of low-income children. Today, over 6 million children--including 14,500 in Maine--receive health care coverage from this remarkably effective health care program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent assessment by the nonpartisan Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, "While the coverage news for the nation is generally bleak, the story for  children's health coverage stands apart. Of all the health reform efforts, covering children has been resoundingly successful. Since its creation, SCHIP has partnered with Medicaid to help ensure that children have the health care that they need."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, there is more that we can do. While Maine ranks among the top 4 States in the Nation in reducing the number of uninsured children, we still have more than 20,000 children who don't have coverage. Nationally, about 9 million children remain uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the authorization for SCHIP, which has done so much to help low-income American families to obtain the health care that they need, is about to expire. As the cochair with Senator ROCKEFELLER of the nonpartisan Alliance for Health Reform, I have long been concerned about the need to extend the SCHIP program in order to renew our commitment to meeting the health care needs of children in our Nation's low-income working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am pleased to support this legislation to extend and strengthen this important program. This bipartisan bill increases funding for SCHIP by $35 billion over the next 5 years, a level which is sufficient to maintain coverage for all 6.6 million children currently enrolled, and also allows the program to expand to cover an additional 3.3 million low-income children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation the Senate is currently debating also improves SCHIP in a number of important ways. I am particularly pleased that the bill includes a requirement for States that offer mental health services through their SCHIP program to provide coverage that is equivalent in scope to benefits for other physician and health services. Treating behavioral and emotional problems and mental illness while children are young is critical to preventing more serious problems later on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the demonstrated need, children's dental coverage offered by States isn't always all that it should be. Low-income and rural children suffer disproportionately from oral health problems. In fact, 80 percent of all tooth decay is found in just 25 percent of children. I am, therefore, cosponsoring amendments with Senators SNOWE, BINGAMAN, CARDIN, and MIKULSKI to strengthen the dental coverage offered through SCHIP to ensure that more low-income children have access to the  dental services that they need to prevent disease and promote oral health. I am hopeful that these amendments will be included in the final package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of the fact that good health begins before birth, the Senate bill also gives States the option of covering low-income pregnant women under SCHIP. Current regulations do permit States to cover unborn children, making reimbursements available for prenatal, labor, and delivery services. Medically necessary postpartum care, however, is not covered. The Senate bill will change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate bill will also eliminate the State shortfall problems that have plagued the SCHIP program, and it also provides additional incentives to encourage States to increase outreach and enrollment, particularly of the lowest income children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. President, the bill before the Senate is a prescription for good health for millions of our Nation's working families, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to congratulate Chairman BAUCUS and Ranking Member GRASSLEY, as well as Senators ROCKEFELLER and HATCH, for their visionary leadership and tireless perseverance in crafting an SCHIP package that has received so much bipartisan support. I also want to thank them for never losing sight of the single over-arching goal--obtaining health insurance for uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to strongly support a Senate resolution I have filed with Senator LINCOLN and a host of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle which contains a resounding and inescapable message: Congress must unite to address the small business health insurance crisis--this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am encouraged by the unprecedented level of constructive, bipartisan dialogue currently taking place on the issue of small business health insurance reform. The roster of support on our Small Business Resolution speaks volumes about its viability: Senators BAUCUS and GRASSLEY, KENNEDY and ENZI and Senators BEN NELSON, DURBIN, SMITH, and CRAPO. This diverse, bipartisan group tells me that the will is there. We can get this done--if we don't retreat to  partisan corners and if we work together and make tough compromises just as we have done on the SCHIP bill--which this body will soon likely pass--where we sat down, rolled up our sleeves, and worked together to fashion a consensus package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As past chair and now ranking member of the Small Business Committee, if there is one concern I have heard time and again, it is the exorbitant cost to small businesses of providing health insurance to their employees. Health insurance premiums have increased at double-digit percentage levels in 4 of the past 6 years--far outpacing inflation and wage gains. Is there any question that the small business health insurance crisis is real?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could not be at a more pivotal juncture on this threshold issue. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, last year the average group-sponsored health insurance policy for an individual was $4,242--the average family plan cost $11,480. And the figures are dramatically worse for those purchasing health insurance in the individual market. For example, in my home State of Maine, a health insurance plan on the individual market can cost a family of four in excess of $24,000 per year. Funds which  could be used for other expenses such as saving for college tuition or retirement security or a down payment on a home--not for one year of health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This phenomenon perpetuates a cycle of spiraling costs and declining access as fewer and fewer small businesses offer health insurance to their employees. Only 48 percent of our smallest businesses are able to provide this workplace benefit--a 10 percent drop from 5 years ago. Clearly, it is time we started heading in the opposite direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, this is easier said than done as small group markets such as those in Maine have no real competition and represent major impediments. No competition means higher costs, and higher costs mean no health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Making matters more challenging is the fact that across the country, the largest insurers now control 43 percent of the small group markets. In Maine, a sum total of four large insurers now control 98 percent of the small group market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the issue isn't whether the United States has the greatest health care system in the world--we do. But with nearly 45 million uninsured in this country, our goal should be nothing less than providing health care access for all. It is all the more incumbent upon this Congress to consider every possible viable avenue and reach across the partisan divide to solve this crisis, an approach that reflects the undeniable will of the American people on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have advocated for and championed Small Business Health Plan legislation which would allow small businesses to "pool" together across state lines to provide their employees with health insurance at significantly lower costs. It is an idea which is gaining growing support. A recent study published by the National Association of Realtors concluded that an overwhelming majority of voters--89 percent, including 93 percent of Republicans and 86 percent of Democrats--favor legislation  that would allow small businesses to pool together to negotiate lower health insurance costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to believe that Small Business Health Plans are a logical solution to the small business health insurance crisis, and I thank Senator ENZI for all of his tremendous efforts in getting legislation passed through the HELP Committee last year, and for having them considered on the Senate floor for the first time ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward in this debate, we must leave no stone unturned in our search for consensus solutions to this crisis as we seek to reform the small group and individual health insurance markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must address how to allow health insurers to provide lower-cost products to small businesses across state lines  while maintaining the most widely accepted and necessary benefits and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must figure out how to "rate," or price, these products--and also how and whether this can be done in a uniform manner, without jeopardizing consumer protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we should examine ways to use the tax code as a mechanism for increasing access to health care and injecting competition into the state small group markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Congress must consider small business health insurance reform legislation this year, in a bipartisan, comprehensive way that can secure significant consensus support. In the coming months, I look forward to a robust and productive debate on this issue in the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization. This is a vitally important program that ensures some of the most vulnerable among us, our children, have access to the health care they deserve. There is no question that we are a country with a health care crisis. In the richest, most powerful country in the world, it is a disgrace that we have 47 million people with no health coverage. Addressing this national  priority is long overdue, so I am especially pleased that this new Congress will take action by extending health care coverage to millions of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress created this program 10 years ago to provide coverage to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, but lacked health care coverage through their employer or the private market. At that time, there were more than ten million children who were uninsured. In the last decade, we have seen the success of the Children's Health Insurance Program; it has covered over 6 million low-income children, providing consistent quality health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the success of this program, it is appropriate that we renew it for 5 more years, but also extend it so that millions of additional low-income, uninsured children will now have health coverage. This expansion is critically important because through CHIP children have far better access to preventive and primary care services than they would if they were uninsured. With more routine health care, we know that kids have better health outcomes and perform better in schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies have also shown that approximately 6 million children are eligible for public coverage but are not enrolled in CHIP. I am pleased that the Finance Committee has been able to craft a bill that would cover 3.2 million children, but I do hope that we can go even further and expand this coverage to additional children. Because uninsured children are nine times less likely to receive needed health care on time and are more likely to go without a visit to a doctor's office, we need to cover  as many of them as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State of Vermont has been a leader when it comes to covering kids. We are referred to an early expansion State because prior to the creation of this program, Vermont extended Medicaid coverage to low-income children through a program known as Dr. Dynasaur. The bill before the Senate would allow Vermont to maintain coverage for the kids currently covered, but also reach out to the remaining children that are eligible but not enrolled in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Finance Committee proposal would also have a positive impact on health care by increasing the tobacco tax. This action will have a significant affect on our country's health, reducing the rate of cancer, strokes and heart attacks. Further, an increase in the tobacco tax will also reduce the prevalence of smoking, especially among adolescents. We know that when cigarettes become more expensive, both kids and adults will change how much they smoke. This is a positive outcome and one that I  support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the hard work that has gone into crafting this bipartisan legislation. I believe it puts the country on the right track towards ensuring all children have health insurance and I strongly support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a monumental day for all Americans but especially children and their families. I am proud of the work we have accomplished over the past few days in the Senate on the Children's Health Insurance Program--or CHIP--Reauthorization Act of 2007. Renewing this program for another 10 years is a fitting way to mark this Sunday, August 5th's 10-year anniversary of the day the first CHIP bill was signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, this legislation was the result of countless hours of negotiations between Senators Baucus, Grassley, and Hatch and I. CHIP legislation has a history of bipartisanship, I am quite proud of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members of this Chamber had hoped for something different in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were some on the other side of the aisle who wanted to place further restrictions on those covered by this bill and decrease the funding to $15 million. I know that there were others on this side of the aisle who wanted to add benefits and increase the funding to $50 billion. Individually, we were each tempted by some of the suggested changes in the more than 86 amendments to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fundamental goal has been sustained throughout our debates and votes--expanding access to health care for millions of children, including those eligible children who are not yet enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of us knows the statistics in our own State. I am proud that nearly 39,000 West Virginians were enrolled in the program last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These kids can see a doctor when they get sick, receive necessary immunizations, and get the preventative screenings they need for a healthy start in life, because of this important program. The passage of this bill means 4,000 more West Virginia children will have affordable and stable health insurance coverage including access to basic preventative care and immunizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bipartisan passage in the Finance Committee was our first "win." Senate passage is the next bold step. Our conference, like all of the CHIP negotiations, will be intense. But if we keep our focus on covering children and bipartisanship, I am confident that we will achieve our vital goal of continuing this successful program for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many individuals have worked long and very hard on this legislation for months. I truly appreciate the efforts of Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley and their professional staff. Senators Hatch and Snowe and their staff played an essential role in our negotiating team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also want to take a moment to mention the extraordinary work of my health care legislative assistant, Jocelyn Moore. She is enormously dedicated and she has a deep commitment to health care policy, especially the needs of children. Jocelyn is a talented professional who have been working around-the-clock for many months. My legislative director, Ellen Doneski, has also been involved throughout the process and is a real leader. I am grateful for their dedication and commitment and inspired  by the intellect and mastery of the issue of children's health policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my staff, and my colleagues. Let's get ready for conference negotiations and stay focused on what matters most--covering children.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when this debate first began, I came to this floor to say that SCHIP has proved to be, in many ways, a remarkable success for this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to a program passed by a Republican-led Congress 10 years ago, the rate of uninsured children in America has dropped by 25 percent from 1996 to 2005. Last year, 6.6 million children had health care because of SCHIP--and over 50,000 of them were in my home State of Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP has accomplished what it was designed to do: protect children in low-income families, families too well off to qualify for Medicaid but still needy enough to have difficulty affording private insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the program came up for reauthorization, this Senate's goal should have been to retain what works, and to strengthen the law in areas where it has been misused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, that is not what happened. SCHIP was originally created to help the needy. But it is clear the authors of this new proposal have overreached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some have seized the reauthorization of SCHIP as a license to raise taxes, increase spending, and take a giant leap forward into the land of government-run health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problems with this bill are numerous, and I have spelled them out on this floor before. Because of a budgeting gimmick, the current bill, <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, will end up costing $41 billion more than advertised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will raise taxes at a time when the American people are already taxed too much by more than doubling the Federal tax on tobacco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will leave open loopholes allowing some States to raid their kids' health funds and use the money for adults. The "C" in "SCHIP" stands for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will allow families in certain States who make as much as four times the Federal poverty level to still qualify for SCHIP insurance. A family of four in New York City making as much as $82,600 could qualify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That means thousands of families in New York alone will be poor enough to receive SCHIP--yet also rich enough to pay the alternative minimum tax, a tax designed specifically to target the so-called "wealthy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By luring people away from the private market, <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill> will eventually remove 2 million people from private health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators Lott, Kyl, Gregg, Bunning and I saw the problems with this bill, and proposed an alternative. The Kids First Act would have reauthorized SCHIP and ensured that states had sufficient resources to cover all of the kids already enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would have added an additional 1.3 million children to the program by 2012. And it would have done all of this without raising taxes or increasing the deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kids First Act kept the focus on SCHIP's true goal: protecting low-income children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many States, including Kentucky, would actually have had more SCHIP funds to spend on kids under the Kids First Act than under the bill on the floor. I am sorry the Senate did not see fit to adopt our proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know many Senators worked their hardest during this debate to craft comprehensive solutions for the uninsured in America. I appreciate their efforts. I look forward to continuing that work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, so much effort has not produced an answer. This bill is unlikely to receive a Presidential signature. Nothing will have been accomplished. We will have to pass a temporary extension of SCHIP, and then go back to the drawing board for a long-term reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we do, I hope the Senate can stay focused like a laser beam on what SCHIP is truly all about: providing a safety net for kids in low-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to craft legislation that can meet that goal, pass this Senate, and be signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for now, the bill on the floor will not accomplish that. I intend to vote "no." And I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are about to vote final passage tonight. I am not going to take the time of Senators for all the customary thank-yous. I will do that at a later date. But I do very much want to thank Senators Grassley, Hatch, and Rockefeller and all the great team who helped make this possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the parents across the country who love their children and are determined to provide the best possible health care for them. I say to the parents, to all Americans, I hope this bill helps you provide that health care, and I think it will. I thank all Senators for their cooperation in helping make this happen tonight.</paragraph>
