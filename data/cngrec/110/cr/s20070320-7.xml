    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say to my good friend, the majority leader, that I will be checking at noon to see if we can avoid the motion to proceed to the budget, but I have not been able to get that cleared yet. I hope that I will be able to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also remind everyone, as the majority leader and I indicated yesterday, budget week is always challenging, with lots of votes and evening sessions. So I would encourage Members on our side, if they have amendments, to offer them early in the week to avoid having them caught up in the vote-arama which will occur, regretfully, at the end of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would finally say the two managers of this bill, Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg, have done this bill many times. They are friends, and they will do everything they can to cooperate with each other. I hope Members will cooperate with them.</paragraph>
