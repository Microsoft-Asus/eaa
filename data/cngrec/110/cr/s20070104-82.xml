  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to honor all our military families by submitting a Resolution to designate November as National Military Family Month. As we all know, memories fade and the hardships experienced by our military families are easily forgotten unless they touch our own immediate family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have our men and women deployed all over the world, engaged in this war on terrorism. These far-ranging military deployments are extremely difficult on the families who bear this heavy burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To honor these families, the Armed Services YMCA has sponsored Military Family Week in late November since 1996. However, due to frequent "short week" conflicts around the Thanksgiving holidays, the designated week has not always afforded enough time to schedule observances on and near our military bases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe a month long observation will allow greater opportunity to plan events. Moreover, it will provide a greater opportunity to stimulate media support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to our military families.</paragraph>
