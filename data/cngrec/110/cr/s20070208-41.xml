    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today as a cosponsor of the Domestic Pet Turtle Market Access Act of 2007. If enacted, this bill would re-open the U.S. market to allow the sale of baby turtles as pets. In Louisiana, we have 72 licensed turtle farmers who produce over 13 million turtles year with a farm value of $9 million. Unless Congress enacts this bill, this industry will die and Louisiana will bear the brunt of the loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1975, the FDA has banned the sale of turtles sold as pets due to health concerns regarding salmonella poisoning. The FDA, through its Center for Veterinary Medicine, banned the sale of baby turtles in the U.S. due to salmonella poisoning occurring in children in households with pet turtles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The industry has survived by taking their market abroad to Asia. Asia has developed their own turtle market and is no longer in need of U.S. turtles. As a result, U.S. turtle farmers have nowhere to sell their product, and they are barely getting by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three decades have now passed and our knowledge of the salmonella bacteria and the technology for treating this bacterium has greatly advanced. Scientists at Louisiana State University have developed salmonella treatments for pet turtles. Thanks to these methods, pet turtles can be treated for salmonella before they are shipped for sale. This treatment, combined with a much higher awareness of how serious salmonella poisoning is and how one prevents transmission of the bacteria, is more than  enough to protect individuals who seek to own pet turtles--in fact, it will be more protection than any other amphibian or reptile seller currently provides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other similar amphibians and reptiles are not banned for sale in the United States and they also carry salmonella and are a potential health threat. There is no requirement that these pets be treated for salmonella before sale. As a result, the FDA has singled out one industry primarily located in Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will require the turtle industry to submit a plan to the FDA for approval. Turtle farmers will be required to demonstrate how they will treat turtles and ensure compliance with this act. The FDA must approve the plan if an acceptable treatment is chosen by the turtle farmer and it exceeds current similar methods being used by other amphibian and reptile pet sellers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Louisiana turtle industry will become a dead industry this year unless Congress enacts this bill and allows the U.S. market to re-open. In 30 years, our understanding of salmonella prevention and the technology and science has advanced tremendously. This bill keeps intact important safety provisions to protect individuals and at the same time allows the re-opening of a market to stop an important industry in Louisiana from dying. I support this bill, and I hope the rest of the Senate will  join me in supporting this commonsense bill that will protect consumers, protect farmers, and bring the joy of caring for pet turtles to millions.</paragraph>
