  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO BRYAN JOHNSTON -- (Senate - June 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5389">S5389</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, former Oregon Governor Tom McCall once said, "Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red sky. They are individuals who say, `This is my community, and it is my responsibility to make it better."'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I pay tribute to Bryan Johnston, a true Oregon hero, who devoted much of his life and career to making Oregon and our State capital city of Salem a better place in which to live, work, and raise a family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like countless others in Oregon, I was shocked and saddened to learn that Bryan passed away last week at the far too early age of 59 years. Bryan's passing deprives my State of one of her most respected, admired and effective public servants; it deprives St. Martin's University in Lacey, WA, of a gifted leader, as Bryan was scheduled to begin his service of president of that university on July 1; it deprives many in Oregon, including myself, of a trusted friend and advisor; and it deprives his  wife Anne and their four children of a loving and dedicated husband and father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his years in Salem, Bryan served in a remarkable number of roles, including: lawyer; professional mediator; Law professor; director of the Center for Dispute Resolution at Willamette University College of Law; dean of the Willamette University Atkinson Graduate School of Management; interim president of Willamette University; Oregon State Representative; and interim director of the Oregon Department of Human Services Children, Adults and Families Division. As the Salem Statesman-Journal  so aptly put it, "Bryan Johnston was Mr. Fix--it for colleges, for state government, and for the Salem-area community."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tributes that have been pouring in since Bryan's passing speak volumes of the impact this gentle and gifted visionary made in so many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Salem business and community leader Dick Withnell said: "He was so wise. He could grasp a tough situation and see what should be done and then be collaborative with people to accomplish it. That's a real gift."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State Senate President Peter Courtney said: "Bryan was a great mediator and facilitator. He was a very, very versatile individual in the area of education and public service. Those are maybe two of the highest callings you can aspire to, if you're chosen; and he was chosen time and again."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Department of Human Services Director Bruce Goldberg stated: "Bryan was a trusted advisor and friend, who brought wisdom, humor, and kindness into all of our lives."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the best tribute to Bryan was paid by my friend John Watt, who served with Bryan in the Oregon State House of Representatives. Said John: "One of the things that has always stuck with me about Bryan is that he truly was doing the work for Oregon. I mean, he wasn't somebody who was after kudos for himself. He didn't necessarily walk lockstep with his caucus. He was always willing to talk and work with people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bryan Johnston talked and worked with people, and because of that, he leaves behind a remarkable legacy of accomplishment and service. Indeed, I am reminded of the words of Mother Teresa, who said: "God does not call us to be successful. God calls us to be faithful."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By any account, Bryan Johnston led a successful life. But I know that more important to him was the fact that he led a faithful life. He was a faithful educator, legislator and public official. He was a faithful husband, and friend. He was a faithful servant of God. May God bless Bryan Johnston.</paragraph>
