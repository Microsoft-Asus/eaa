    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in 1993, when professional baseball owners were deciding how to rehabilitate the reputation of baseball after the players' strike, they debated whether to enact a wild-card rule to allow the second place team into the playoffs. Only one owner at the time voted against this, Texas Rangers general partner, George Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the rule passed 27-1, at the time the President said, "I made my arguments and went down in flames. History will prove me right."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, nearly a third of the World Series Champions have been wild-card teams, including the 2004 World Series Champion Boston Red Sox. The rule helped save baseball, as history has shown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just like his baseball predictions, President Bush sings a very similar tune about Iraq. He says, as recently as yesterday, "History will prove whether I'm right, and I think I'll be right."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Really? Five years today since his speech on "Mission Accomplished." And let's take stock. More than 4,000 lives have been lost, tens of thousands of American men and women have been injured, we've spent over 475 billion taxpayer dollars in Iraq, with the price tag continually going up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History will judge whether, once again, George Bush's record and America's reputation will go down in flames. At this rate, he's 0 for 2.</paragraph>
