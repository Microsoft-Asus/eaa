    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to some of the comments that were just made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle; notably, "how quickly we forget."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also what the majority leader just said about our anger, and he understands our anger. Well, you know what? I don't think he understands our anger when he says it does no good to repeat the last 12 years of our feeling aggrieved. Because I can assure you that never once did we in the majority attempt to steal a vote, attempt to steal a vote to make sure, to make sure that illegal immigrants, to make sure that our position, the Republican position to defeat the ability for benefits to flow to  illegal immigrants. That is what this is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, as the whip said before me, the gentleman from New York admits a mistake and apologizes. We accept that apology. It was a bad call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the price to pay for that bad call should be to admit that the motion to recommit passed, the bill should go back to committee, the committee does its work, and the bill comes back to the floor.</paragraph>
