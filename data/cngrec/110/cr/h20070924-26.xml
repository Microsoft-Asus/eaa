    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to encourage passage of House Resolution 79, recognizing the establishment of Hunters for the Hungry programs across the United States and recognizing the contributions of those programs to decrease hunger and help feed those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunters for the Hungry is a unique and innovative program that addresses hunger in communities nationwide. Hunters can donate their game and  fowl to Hunters for the Hungry which processes the meat and provides it to food banks and other feeding programs. This cooperative effort between hunters, processors, and the hunger community is an innovative example of how groups can work together toward a single worthy goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation received unanimous support in the House Agriculture Committee, and I strongly encourage passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="79">H. Res. 79</bill> and applaud this body for recognizing the collaborative efforts of hunters, sportsmen's associations, meat processors, State meat inspectors and hunger relief associations to establish Hunters for the Hungry programs across the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a hunter donates a deer, it is processed by professional meat cutters at inspected facilities. The meat is then packaged, frozen and distributed to food banks, soup kitchens, church food pantries, the Salvation Army and other nonprofit organizations serving the States' hungry. Funds are raised to cover the cost of processing, distribution and the overhead expenses of operation so that the meat can be provided to these agencies at no cost. Through the program, food banks and soup kitchens  are provided with a low-fat, high-protein meat that may not otherwise be available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own State of Virginia, the Virginia Hunters for the Hungry program has distributed over 2.3 million pounds of venison since its establishment in 1991. In the first year, roughly 33,000 pounds of venison was donated, processed and distributed through the program. Now, the average exceeds 300,000 pounds a year, and this program is a reflection of the generosity of the American spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the generosity of Virginia hunters and all who participate in the Hunters for the Hungry program, whose contributions are a step in the right direction in the fight against hunger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me say on a personal note that I have had the pleasure of supporting this organization for several years now, and just recently, a few weeks ago, attended a Hunters for the Hungry banquet, at which the spirit of not just hunters but people who are generous and want to take care of the needs of those who can use additional sustenance and I think in a very efficient way have participated in this program and showed that generosity once more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I commend all those, not just in Virginia but across the country, who participate in this, and I particularly commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) who has fostered this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time it's my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) such time as he may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte, my good friend from California (Mr. Cardoza), my classmate, and all the members on the Agriculture Committee for bringing this resolution to the floor today during the inaugural Congressional Sportsmen's Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, under the leadership of co-chairs RON KIND of Wisconsin and PAUL RYAN of Wisconsin, during this Congress. This bipartisan organization, comprised of close to 300 Members of the House and Senate, focuses on protecting the interests of our Nation's sportsmen. As a proud member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I know that it works diligently for our sportsmen who have historically shaped the character and the quality  of America's cultural heritage, natural resources and economic vitality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Goodlatte said, I first introduced the Hunters for the Hungry resolution in the 108th Congress to bring attention to an often overlooked group, our Nation's hunters, who help feed thousands of homeless and hungry people each year. The purpose of this resolution is to praise the work of Hunters for Hungry programs across our country. These programs provide a unique way in which to address our Nation's hunger problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although these organizations are called by different names across the country, Hunters for the Hungry organizations show the humanitarian and the kindhearted spirit of our Nation's hunting community. These programs are volunteer and cooperative efforts among hunters, sportsmen's associations, meat processors, State meat inspectors and hunger relief organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 3 years, these programs have brought hundreds of thousands of pounds of excess venison to homeless shelters, soup kitchens and food banks. Each year, donations have multiplied, and many programs now cannot even cover the costs of processing, packaging, storing and distributing the abundant supply of donated venison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunters for the Hungry organizations serve as a great example of how our Nation can address issues like hunger without government intervention. These organizations receive no Federal funds, and they operate from donations and volunteer service. We must raise the awareness of these organizations so they can have the resources and the volunteers to serve America's underprivileged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One such organization, Mr. Speaker, in my district is Pure Cuts Deer Processing in Floyd County. Nick Ballinger operates this volunteer effort, and it feeds thousands of hungry people in northwest Georgia. He's always open to both financial contributions and venison donations so that he can expand the organization and feed more people annually. Nick is just one of many kindhearted hunters who donate their time and money for those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I once again ask the House to speak in one voice of gratitude and urge passage of the Hunters for the Hungry resolution to honor this great community service.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I'd like to rise to congratulate my colleague, Mr. Gingrey from Georgia, on this legislation, and also thank my colleague and friend Mr. Goodlatte for managing it on the Republican side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our chairman on the Democratic side, Mr. Peterson, is an avid hunter and, I'd like to say, a very successful one as well. I know he wants to extend his gratitude for this bill and totally supports it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
