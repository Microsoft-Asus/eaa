  <narrative>WHAT GEORGE WOULD HAVE DONE -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1189]</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) is recognized during morning-hour debate for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the weekend, the Washington Post carried a thoughtful op-ed that I think  we ought to send down to the White House to make sure the President reads. It's called "Lessons on Iraq from a Founding Father." The author, Brian O'Malley, an adjunct professor at Jones College in Jacksonville, Florida, reminds us that the Nation's first President, George Washington, could offer some good insights into what to do in  Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fall of 1775, before the Declaration of Independence, the fledgling Nation prepared to invade Canada, in what the author calls America's first preemptive war. George Washington had misgivings, and he expressed them in his letters to his commander, Colonel Benedict Arnold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington explicitly told Arnold to be sure that the Canadian people wanted America to cross the border. In his words, "ever bearing in mind that if they are averse to it, and will not cooperate, or at least willingly acquiesce, it must fail of success. In this case you are by no means to prosecute the attempt."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington also understood that the safety of his soldiers depended on how they treated people, and he urged restraint. In his words, "not only the good of their country and their honor, but their safety depends upon the treatment of these people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first President also worried about treating prisoners properly and with respect. He ordered his commander to restrain his forces, in his words, "from all acts of cruelty and insult, which will disgrace the American arms, and irritate our fellow subjects against us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington even warned of consequence against any American found to mistreat a prisoner. And Washington understood the need to respect religion, telling his commander to restrain officers and soldiers from any ridicule or disrespect of religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concerns raised by Washington in 1775 are exactly the concerns that should have been raised in 2002 before the Iraq invasion. It might have been prevented Abu Ghraib. It might have prevented the wholesale dismissal and dismantling of the Iraq army that led to the rise of insurgents. It might have prevented an Iraq quagmire that has needlessly claimed American lives, wastefully drained our Treasury, carelessly tainted American leadership in the world and absolutely harmed our economy here  at home. That is the Iraq war record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History is replete with lessons, but unless we learn the lessons of history, we are doomed to repeat them. That is what is going on in Iraq today. The latest estimate places the cost of the war at $3 trillion, and that doesn't account for the cost of treating the thousands of U.S. soldiers coming back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq is like quicksand, and America sinks deeper and deeper every single day. Our military is in shambles, the housing market looks more and more like a house of cards, the U.S. dollar is in free fall against other currencies, and the U.S. economy is in recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President says he hasn't heard that respected economists are talking about $4 a gallon gasoline next month. He's the only one who's missed the news. Gas is up almost $1 from a year ago. Diesel prices have already climbed to $3.60. But they have a rose garden down at the White House and a President who thinks everything is rosy. And if he says it, then it must be true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is true is that Americans are using credit cards just to try and stay afloat. What is true is that a record number of Americans are losing their homes to foreclosure. What is true is that a President fixated on waging a perpetual Iraq war ignored the urgent needs of the American people. He has squandered their money and our leadership. The only signs pointing upward for the President are those that proclaim more bad news--another house foreclosed, another family bankruptcy. Instead of gazing  out the window at the rose garden, the President ought to try walking down Main Street and talking to a few people. He is out of touch and America is out of time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Lessons on Iraq From a Founding Father</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Brian O'Malley)</narrative>
  <narrative>What would George Washington do about Iraq? In a December Outlook essay, historian Joseph J. Ellis argued that it's not possible to theorize exact answers because the "gap between the founders' time and ours is non-negotiable, and any direct linkage between them and now is intellectually problematic." But Ellis also conceded that this position is "unacceptable to many of us, because it suggests that the past is an eternally lost world that has nothing to teach us."</narrative>
  <narrative>History does hold lessons about today's issues, and this is clear when considering Iraq and U.S. conduct in the war against terrorism. Consider the 1775-76 invasion of Canada, America's first preemptive war, which ended just days before Congress ratified the Declaration of Independence.</narrative>
  <narrative>On Sept. 14, 1775, Washington wrote two letters to Col. Benedict Arnold, who led an American force into Canada. Five of Washington's points for invasion merit particular attention.</narrative>
  <narrative>First, if the citizens don't want us there, don't go. Washington told Arnold, "You are by every means in your power to endeavor to discover the real sentiments of the Canadians towards our cause, and particularly as to this expedition; ever bearing in mind that if they are averse to it, and will not co-operate, or at least willingly acquiesce, it must fail of success. In this case you are by no means to prosecute the attempt."</narrative>
  <narrative>The expense of starting the mission and the disappointment of not completing it, Washington wrote, "are not to be put in competition with the dangerous consequences which may ensue from irritating them against us."</narrative>
  <narrative>Second, the safety of American personnel depended on how they treated people. Washington wanted Arnold to "conciliate the affections" of the Canadian settlers and Indians and ordered Arnold to teach the soldiers and officers under his command "that not only the Good of their Country and their Honour, but their Safety depends upon the Treatment of these People."</narrative>
  <narrative> Third, proper treatment of prisoners was necessary. The prominent British parliamentarian William Pitt, who championed American grievances, had a son serving in Canada. John Pitt was never taken into American custody, but in the event that Pitt was captured, Washington warned Arnold, "You cannot err in paying too much Honour to the Son of so illustrious a Character, and so true a Friend to America."</narrative>
  <narrative>This insistence on kind treatment extended beyond Pitt. Washington wrote, "Any other Prisoners who may fall into your Hands, you will treat with as much Humanity and kindness, as may be consistent with your own Safety and the publick Interest."</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington told Arnold to restrain the Continental troops and their Indian allies "from all Acts of Cruelty and Insult, which will disgrace the American Arms, and irritate our Fellow Subjects against us."</narrative>
  <narrative>Fourth, any Americans who mistreated Canadians should be punished. "Should any American Soldier be so base and infamous as to injure any Canadian or Indian, in his Person or Property," Washington wrote, "I do most earnestly enjoin you to bring him to such severe and exemplary Punishment as the Enormity of the Crime may require." In an accompanying letter Washington added, "Should it extend to Death itself it will not be disproportional to its Guilt, at such a Time and in such a Cause."</narrative>
  <narrative>Fifth, respect the people's religion. "As the Contempt of the Religion of a Country by ridiculing any of its Ceremonies or affronting its Ministers or Votaries, has ever been deeply resented, you are to be particularly careful to restrain every Officer and Soldier from such Imprudence and Folly and to punish every Instance of it."</narrative>
  <narrative>American ideals won immediate support from the Canadians, but American misconduct squandered it. Contrary to Washington's orders, some American commanders disrespected Canadians' religion, property and liberty.</narrative>
  <narrative>Lamenting this American misconduct, Washington wrote to Gen. Philip Schuyler on April 19, 1776, "I am afraid proper measures have not been taken to conciliate their affections, but rather that they have been insulted and injured, than which nothing could have a greater tendency to ruin our cause in that country; for human nature is such that it will adhere to the side from whence the best treatment is received."</narrative>
  <narrative>George Washington is still first in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen. It's too bad he couldn't have been the first person we asked about how to proceed in Iraq.</narrative>
