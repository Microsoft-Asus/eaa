  <narrative>138 DAYS, NO VETERANS BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12348]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come here today to continue my call on the leadership to move the Veterans appropriations bill forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As of today, we have gone 138 days in this Chamber with no action, no plan of action, and more importantly, no veterans bill. I am concerned that we have a $4.4 billion increase in veterans health care collecting dust on someone's desk in this very building. I suspect that there are many people here today and watching at home who are also troubled as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud that the veterans issues are not partisan. They never should be. I am also proud to be a member of a bipartisan Veterans Committee. I am not proud, however, that we have gone this long into the year without a single appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call on the leadership of the House to get on the stick, get past whatever reason or strategy that is holding this important bill up, and get a clean bill to the President so we can deliver this money to these heroes to whom we owe so much.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
