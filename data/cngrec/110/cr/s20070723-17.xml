  <narrative>RECOGNIZING WALL, SOUTH DAKOTA -- (Senate - July 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9773">S9773</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Wall, S.D. The town of Wall will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wall, located in Pennington County, has a rich history of hospitality towards visitors. It was here in 1931 that the world famous Wall Drug Store began handing out free ice water to travelers during the height of the Depression. Today, Wall Drug attracts over a million people each year. Despite the large number of visitors, the same generosity that first attracted people to the town back in 1931 can still be found today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wall community is a fine example of what makes South Dakota such a great place to live and work. As they celebrate this milestone anniversary, I am confident that Wall will continue to thrive and succeed for the next 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Wall on their 100th anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
