  <narrative>SOUND POLICY FOR AMERICA'S ENERGY NEEDS, NOT HOLLOW PROMISES -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14088]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when it comes to a national energy policy, here we go again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, the Democratic leadership promised to work across party lines to come up with a sound, comprehensive energy bill that would address Americans' anxieties about dramatically high gas prices and escalating home heating costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the Democratic energy proposals have lacked any substance to outline a blueprint for increasing our domestic supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake: we must boost our domestic energy supply. The American people want stable prices at the pump, and we can begin to address these problems; but we in Congress must make reasoned energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By promoting a level playing field for technologies, diversifying energy supplies, and increasing our domestic opportunities, we can harness our ingenuity and natural resources to relieve our current difficulties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people expect more from Congress. We must increase our supply without overburdening energy producers with unwieldy bureaucracy. Let's work together to help the American people and provide some relief to the anxiety they face this winter.</paragraph>
