    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at some point this week, Congress is going to consider a massive omnibus spending bill that rolls the 11 remaining appropriation bills into one enormous bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish I could take the floor today and talk about what's in the floor bill, but I can't, because I have no idea. I'm far from alone. Save for a few Members of leadership, all of us are in the dark  about what could be in this massive bill that we're going to be voting on in just a matter of hours. With the likelihood of thousands and thousands of earmarks in the bill, our constituents deserve a process that, at the very least, Members have an opportunity  to read the bill before we vote on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the majority argues that such tactics are no more egregious than those that Republicans employed during our years in the majority. That may be true, but I would remind my colleagues that that's one of the reasons we find ourselves in the minority today. This institution deserves far better.</paragraph>
