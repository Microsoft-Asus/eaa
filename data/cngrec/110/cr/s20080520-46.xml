  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the important work and accomplishments of the Screen Actors Guild as the organization celebrates its 75th anniversary. Founded on June 30, 1933, the Screen Actors Guild was established in part as a reaction to the restrictive, long-term studio engagement contracts. Since then, it has helped to protect and improve the lives of actors and their families by fighting for fair wages and health and retirement benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Screen Actors Guild has a unique position in labor history. It claims a former Senator, George Murphy, and a former President, Ronald Reagan, as former union presidents, as well as James Cagney, Charlton Heston, Edward Asner, Patty Duke, Dennis Weaver, and many other notable actors. Its current president is Alan Rosenberg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The founding meeting of the Screen Actors Guild included just six actors. Yet, 75 years later, it has more than 127,000 members with 20 offices across the United States. It represents a broad variety of members from motion pictures, television programs and commercials, and nonbroadcast industries such as video games, music video, Internet, and other new media formats. The Screen Actors Guild has also taken a leading role in combating movie and new media piracy, while working toward increased  privacy protections, child labor laws, and health care reform. With the rapid expansion of so many alternative forms of entertainment, it has also met the challenge of representing its members in new challenging contract issues. And, of course, its esteemed Screen Actors Guild Awards honor its members each year for outstanding performances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite all of my colleagues to join me in commending the Screen Actors Guild for its dedication to improving workers' rights on its 75th anniversary.</paragraph>
