    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we hear and read about so many examples of waste by the Federal bureaucracy that almost nothing shocks or surprises us anymore. However, the Washington Post reported yesterday on a really ridiculous waste of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Emergency Management Agency paid $24 million for 112,000 tons of ice after Hurricane Katrina. 42,000 tons were stored for future use, and FEMA paid $12.5 million in storage fees. Now, all this unused ice is going to be thrown away. But here is the really ridiculous part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FEMA is going to pay $3.4 million, $3,400,000 to melt the ice. It's over 90 degrees outside. The Department of Homeland Security, of which FEMA is a part, has 171,000 employees. A first-grader could melt ice. But the Federal Government is going to pay $3,400,000 to have it done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No wonder the Federal Government is almost $9 trillion in debt. If we ever created a Hall of Fame of government waste, FEMA should be the first admission.</paragraph>
