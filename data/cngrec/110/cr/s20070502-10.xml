    <paragraph>Mr. President, our trade policy is fundamentally flawed. Years of wrongheaded trade pacts have sent millions of jobs overseas, devastated our communities, and opened our Nation too often to serious homeland security concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we open our borders to trade, as we should, we open them to national security threats. Congress must assure the American people we have done everything within our power to protect their safety and their health and their welfare and to promote fair trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated that less than 10 percent of foreign cargo is inspected before entering our country. We must both ensure that our ports are operated securely and with clear lines of accountability, unlike the deal to transfer operation of six U.S. ports to a state-owned company controlled by the United Arab Emirates that this administration approved just last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decision to allow a UAE-controlled company to run our ports had significant national security implications. The UAE was, and still may be, a financial and travel outlet for known terrorists. It was not until leaders in both parties in the Senate and in the House of Representatives called attention to this enormous blunder that this deal was stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative Congress take steps to ensure our homeland security needs are secured every bit as much as our economic well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am introducing, with Senator BYRON DORGAN of North Dakota, the Trade-Related American National Security Enhancement and Accountability, TRANSEA, Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act requires the Office of the United States Trade Representative, in collaboration with the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Justice, to submit a report to Congress detailing the national security considerations of proposed trade agreements prior to commencing and after concluding those trade negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also requires future trade agreements negotiated by the administration to include a national security waiver that allows the President to suspend any terms of the agreement should it be required in the interests of U.S. national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, as a final safeguard, the legislation creates a new Congressional Executive Commission on Trade Security, requiring the appointment of Commissioners by both political parties in both Chambers of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commissioners will be charged with annually certifying that the terms of the free-trade agreement do not pose a threat to our Nation's national security interests. Should the Commission find that compliance with the agreement would pose a threat, the President will be obligated to exercise his or her waiver to the extent necessary to ensure the safety and the security of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a post-9/11 world, U.S. economic policy can simply no longer be viewed in the narrow scopes of bottom lines and profit margins. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said, in 2006:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to balance the paramount urgency of security against the fact that we still want to have a robust global trading system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do both. It is the responsibility of our Government to ensure that while opening markets for our exporters, as we should, our first priority remains the safety and the security of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
