    <paragraph>Mr. President, it was 125 years ago that pioneers in Dakota Territory created the community that is now Rutland, ND. Those pioneers included hopeful immigrants from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, Poland, England, and Scotland, seeking new homesteads on the unbroken prairie; hard-driving businessmen and railroad workers from the Eastern States finding opportunity on America's frontier; and the Wahpeton-Sisseton band of the Dakota people, adapting to changing times and preserving  ancient traditions as their world changed around them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These pioneers built a solid foundation of family, faith, and education for their community, establishing farm homes, churches, and schools first. When the Great Northern Railway built its line through the territory, the community was given its name in honor of Rutland, VT, the hometown of many of the pioneer railroaders. The green hills of the Coteau de Prairie south of the town, reminded them of their home in the Green Mountains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In those early years, the pioneers of the Rutland community endured drought, harsh winters, and economic exploitation, but their faith, independent spirit, and cooperative attitude carried them through the tough times and made the good times better. It has been said that Rutland could be renamed Phoenix because, like that mythical bird, the city's business district has twice risen from the ashes of devastating fires to rebuild better and stronger each time. One of the business buildings destroyed  by the second fire, back in 1941, was a unique combination of economic enterprises, perhaps a forerunner of today's megamalls. The second floor was a hotel, providing rest and refuge for weary travelers, while three businesses occupied the ground floor: In the front was a harness and shoe repair shop, keeping Rutland folks either afoot or on horseback, and they always knew which; at the center of the building was a cream station, where farm produce including chickens, eggs, cream, and butter was bought and sold; and at the rear of the building was a funeral parlor, which had a double life as an illicit gambling</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 125 years, Rutland has been noted for many accomplishments: The home of one of North Dakota's outstanding amateur baseball teams, the Rutland Roosters; the Rutland Rockets and Sargent Central Cadets High School sports teams always tough and usually victorious; location of the Tewaukon National Wildlife Refuge, conserving and preserving our Nation's natural heritage; an award as a National Bicentennial Community in 1976; an award as a North Dakota Centennial Community in 1989; home  to Obed Wyum, a national leader in the establishment of rural electric and rural telephone cooperatives; and making it  into the "Guinness Book of World Records" with the world's largest hamburger, a 3,591-pound whopper, as part of the community's centennial celebration in 1982.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But many more of Rutland's successes never garnered headlines. They were the quiet but meaningful stories of strong families, vibrant businesses, prosperous farms, good kids, and the warmth of citizens who cared about each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rutland is both a wellspring and a repository of what is best about America--old-fashioned values of honesty, decency, hard work, faith, and family. Its foundation is solid, and its people will continue to create a community where dreams are turned into reality.</paragraph>
