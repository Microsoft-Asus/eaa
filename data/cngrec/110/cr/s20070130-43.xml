    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, we are now close to completing action on all germane amendments that are pending to <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>. It is my understanding that Senator Kyl will be here in the morning, and we will resume the bill to debate his amendments. Therefore, Members should be advised to expect rollcall votes tomorrow, and the votes could occur prior to noon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does the distinguished Republican leader have anything to say?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>No. Let me say to my friend, the majority leader, I think we have gotten off to a good start this year. We are close to accomplishing two important pieces of legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support. We look forward to moving ahead with a rather contentious debate next week but a debate we obviously ought to have. It is the most important issue in the country with a lot of passionate feelings on both sides of the issue, and  we  will have a grand debate in the tradition of the United States Senate next week.</paragraph>
