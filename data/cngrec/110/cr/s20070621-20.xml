  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 6-8, the residents of Edinburg will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The town of Edinburg is located on the edge of the Red River Valley and the western prairies. Although it is a small town, Edinburg has the drive, dreams, and heart of cities ten times  its size. The father of Edinburg was a Norwegian by the name of Christian Buck. He became the first postmaster of Edinburg when the post office was established in 1882. The town of Edinburg was named in honor of the university where Mr. Buck obtained his college education.  The first establishments in Edinburg included a blacksmith shop and a drug store.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite a significant fire that destroyed nearly all of the town's businesses in 1900, Edinburg has grown and flourished since its beginning. Known as the Bird Capital of North Dakota, Edinburg offers many opportunities for bird enthusiasts to observe nature at its finest. A city park offers the chance for family gatherings and picnics. The Edinburg Fire Department is boasted as one of the best in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The town of Edinburg is a beautiful place for people to live and visitors to visit. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the town will hold an all school reunion, a street dance, a parade and fireworks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Edinburg, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Edinburg and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Edinburg that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Edinburg has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
