    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dave Fleck for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects his hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role he has played in giving back to his local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave Fleck works with the Greater Sioux Falls Habitat for Humanity. His company, Sioux Falls Construction, has donated construction management services to the Greater Sioux Falls Habitat affiliate. Dave has taken on leadership roles in the construction and site selection for 8 years now. He has participated in Habitat activities at every level. Dave is also a member of the chamber of commerce. The Greater Sioux Falls Habitat for Humanity truly benefits from the support that Dave Fleck provides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Dave Fleck and to congratulate him on receiving this well-earned award and wish him continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
