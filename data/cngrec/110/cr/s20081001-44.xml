  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Ms. Kelsey Landt of Paducah, KY, who is a premed senior at the University of Kentucky at 13 years old. Before her teenage years Kelsey participated in spinal cord injury research at the University of Kentucky, and while at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, she utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation to understand reward processing. At the age of 10, she presented her work at the 2005 Community College Conference for  Student Research in Madisonville, KY, and this year, she  participated in a summer internship program at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. At an age when many children look to hangout at a local mall, Kelsey has already built a resume that mirrors those students who were born more than a decade before her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to her academic activities, Kelsey is involved in community life. She is presently the youngest account holder at the Community Foundation of West Kentucky where she raises money for medical and research based charitable organizations. She is a regular at the local Salvation Army and makes time to volunteer at a local children's hospital in Lexington, KY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After earning a bachelor's degree in biology at the University of Kentucky next spring, Kelsey will begin her postbaccalaureate position at the National Institutes of Health and then hopes to attend medical school. Like most Kentuckians, I look forward to seeing all that she will accomplish as she works toward her goal of becoming a medical scientist.</paragraph>
