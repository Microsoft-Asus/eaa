    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I certainly will not object--I just want to take a brief moment to say how pleased I am we are able to reach this bipartisan compromise. This package will extend the current Internet tax moratorium for 7 years--nearly twice as long as the bill passed over in the House of Representatives. This is a positive step in protecting American consumers from taxes on Internet access, taxes that strike at the heart of innovation and  economic growth in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for his skillful role in bringing this issue before the Senate, for pushing it aggressively, and getting, in my judgment, a much better solution to this problem than was achieved in the House of Representatives. I know he shares my view, and I assume the view of everyone in the Senate, that the House will simply take up the Sununu measure and pass it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I also want to express my appreciation for the diligent work of my friend from Delaware. Senator Carper has worked on this issue for years. We have had a number of others who have been involved in this issue. Of course, the chairman of the committee, Senator Inouye, has been very helpful during the day. We have had assistance from Senator Rockefeller and Senator Wyden, but I and the Senate owe a debt of gratitude for the work done by  my friend from Delaware, working with our friend from New Hampshire.</paragraph>
