  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since The Washington Post broke the story on Building 18 at Walter Reed, we have heard similar stories of unacceptably bad conditions at other facilities around the country. While The Post should be commended for bringing the information to this Nation, it should never have gotten to this point. Last week, we also learned that some Republican colleagues knew of these conditions and basically did nothing. This response of doing nothing is not acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than inquiring about such bad conditions and deciding to do something, they choose to brush it off and basically bring it under the table. And rather than finding out who was responsible for the housing of our troops that had mold, that had mice and cockroaches, the administration chose to look the other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Doing nothing is not acceptable. Last week, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I sit on, held hearings, and will continue to hold hearings, on the treatment of our wounded soldiers throughout this country. We want to see the widespread problems that exist corrected, and we recognize the seriousness. It is time for us to do the right thing for our soldiers.</paragraph>
