    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the talented and dedicated students, faculty, and staff of the School of Medicine of the University of South Carolina for the innovative work they are doing in the development and use of ultrasound technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often called the stethoscope of the 21st century, ultrasound holds great potential for future advancements in medicine. With the growing portability and accessibility of modern ultrasound devices, this technology will help physicians better diagnose and treat patients for conditions such as heart failure, gallstones, aneurysms, and much more, particularly in rural areas. USC is leading the way by establishing an ultrasound institute to ensure graduates are well trained in the use of ultrasound  technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Dr. Richard Hoppman, Dr. Prakash Nagarkatti, and Dr. Stanley Fowler for taking the time to introduce me to this training program, as well as for the extraordinary work they are doing on behalf of the USC community in the advancement of health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
