  <chair>The Senate proceeded to consider the bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to reduce the health risks posed by asbestos-containing products, and for other purposes, which had been reported from the Committee on Environment and Public Works, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following:</chair>
  <chair>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1)(A) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a substance; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) many people in the United States incorrectly believe that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the use of new commercial products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the United States Geological Survey reported that, in 2006, the United States used 2,000 metric tons of asbestos, of which approximately--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) 55 percent was used in roofing products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) 26 percent was used in coatings; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) 19 percent was used in other products, such as friction products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the Department of Commerce estimates that the United States imports more than $100,000,000 of brake parts per year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) available evidence suggests that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) imports of some types of asbestos-containing products are increasing; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) some of those products are imported from foreign countries in which asbestos is poorly regulated;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) even low levels of exposure to asbestos may cause asbestos-related diseases, including mesothelioma;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) millions of workers in the United States have been, and continue to be, exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) worker deaths from noncancerous lung disease can occur at levels of exposure to asbestos below the levels allowed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration as of the date of enactment of this Act;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) families of workers are put at risk because of asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, skin, and hair of the workers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) approximately  1/3  of mesothelioma victims were exposed to asbestos while serving the United States on Navy ships or shipyards;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress in 2006 that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, and treat;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14)(A) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) although new combination treatments for mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 year after diagnosis of the disease; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of the disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) in hearings before Congress in the early 1970s, the example of asbestos was used to justify the need for comprehensive legislation on toxic substances;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (16) in 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (17) in 1989, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated final regulations under title II of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et seq.) to phase out asbestos in consumer products by 1997;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (18) in 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit overturned portions of the regulations, and the Federal Government did not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (19) as a result, while new applications for asbestos were banned, asbestos is still being imported and used, and is otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and industrial products in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (20) the National Cancer Institute recognizes a clear need for new agents to improve the outlook for patients with mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (21) the National Institutes of Health should continue to improve detection, treatment, and management of asbestos-related diseases, such as mesothelioma, including by providing continued support for the pleural mesothelioma treatment and research program and peritoneal surgical initiatives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (22) the Department of Defense should study diseases related to asbestos exposure in the military and veteran population, including by conducting research in coordination with the National Institutes of Health on the early detection and treatment of mesothelioma;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (23) with some exceptions relating to certain uses, asbestos has been banned in 40 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (24) asbestos was banned throughout the European Union in 2005; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (25) banning asbestos from being used in or imported into the United States will provide certainty to manufacturers, builders, environmental remediation firms, workers, and consumers that after a specific date, asbestos will not be used, added, or allowed to be knowingly present as a contaminant in new construction and manufacturing materials used in this country.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Title II of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et seq.) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) by inserting before section 201 (15 U.S.C. 2641) the following:</chair>

  </chair>
  <chair> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1)(A) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a substance; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) many people in the United States incorrectly believe that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the use of new commercial products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the United States Geological Survey reported that, in 2006, the United States used 2,000 metric tons of asbestos, of which approximately--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) 55 percent was used in roofing products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) 26 percent was used in coatings; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) 19 percent was used in other products, such as friction products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the Department of Commerce estimates that the United States imports more than $100,000,000 of brake parts per year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) available evidence suggests that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) imports of some types of asbestos-containing products are increasing; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) some of those products are imported from foreign countries in which asbestos is poorly regulated;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) families of workers are put at risk because of asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, skin, and hair of the workers; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress in 2006 that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, and treat;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9)(A) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) although new combination treatments for mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 year after diagnosis of the disease; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of the disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) in hearings before Congress in the early 1970s, the example of asbestos was used to justify the need for comprehensive legislation on toxic substances;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) in 1976, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) in 1989, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated final regulations under title II of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et seq.) to phase out asbestos in consumer products by 1997;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) in 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit overturned portions of the regulations, and the Federal Government did not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) as a result, while new applications for asbestos were banned, asbestos is still being imported and used, and is otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and industrial products in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) the National Cancer Institute recognizes a clear need for new agents to improve the outlook for patients with mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (16) the National Institutes of Health should continue to improve detection, treatment, and management of asbestos-related diseases, such as mesothelioma, including by providing continued support for the pleural mesothelioma treatment and research program and peritoneal surgical initiatives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (17) the Department of Defense should study diseases related to asbestos exposure in the military and veteran population, including by conducting research in coordination with the National Institutes of Health on the early detection and treatment of mesothelioma;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (18) with some exceptions relating to certain uses, asbestos has been banned in 40 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (19) asbestos was banned throughout the European Union in 2005; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (20) banning asbestos from being used in or imported into the United States will provide certainty to manufacturers, builders, environmental remediation firms, workers, and consumers that after a specific date, asbestos will not be used, added, or allowed to be knowingly present as a contaminant in new construction and manufacturing materials used in this country.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Title II of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2641 et seq.) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) by inserting before section 201 (15 U.S.C. 2641) the following:</chair>

  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues in the Senate for taking a moment this afternoon to pass a very important piece of legislation. What the Senate did was pass the Ban Asbestos in America Act of 2007. This is a piece of legislation I have been working on now for almost 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I heard about Americans and people who were dying from asbestos, I thought to myself, my gosh, I thought asbestos was banned many years ago. How can this be?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the fact is asbestos has never been banned. In fact, today 2,500 metric tons of asbestos are being imported every year. It is in products such as hair dryers, ceiling tiles, it is in brake pads, and over 3,000 other products Americans are using and being exposed to every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I began, with Senator Paul Wellstone, 6 years ago to try and pass this legislation. Of course, I lost my friend Senator Wellstone in an airplane crash. I thought to myself: Wow, how am I ever going to get this out of the Senate without his passion?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I was very fortunate because I found another partner who was just as passionate, and he is here with us today, Senator Isakson from Georgia, who took up this banner with me, who has worked this bill through every way possible, because he too looked in the eyes of those families who were losing loved ones, members of their families today, because asbestos was exposing them to deadly diseases, and they were dying of mesothelioma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not have done it without him. I thank him from the bottom of my heart for working this bill through every nook and cranny, every difficult challenge we have had, every difficult sentence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For anybody out there who thinks legislation passes without anybody looking at it, we can tell you that every "T" has been crossed, every "I"  has been dotted, and this legislation, when it passes, is going to make a real difference in the lives of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Boxer, the chair of the EPW Committee, who, when she heard us working on this bill 7 or 8 months ago now, said: Senator Murray, Senator Isakson, this bill is in my jurisdiction. I am going to work with you to get it passed. She has worked every single day through all of the challenges we have had, to this moment now, and what a moment it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I began this battle, I began it with two men I met who were dying of mesothelioma as a result of being exposed to asbestos: Fred Biekkola and Brian Harvey. I told them I would stand with them every step of the way until this bill was passed, sent to the President, and signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I lost both Brian and Fred, because they died of mesothelioma. But I have met many others along the way too. Today I stand here on the floor of the Senate and I tell everyone, when you believe in something, and you work hard, and you find good people to work with you, you can make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the Freds and the Brians and the many other people I have met, and my great colleagues on the floor of the Senate, today we are making a difference. We are well on our way to banning the use of asbestos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes now to the House. We are working to make sure the House gets this passed and to the President's desk. I can tell everyone in America, when that bill is signed, we will no longer be exposed to the importation and use of asbestos in this country. You can pick up your hair dryer, or know that the ceiling tiles you buy, or the brake pads that are in your car, or the mechanic who is exposed to it accidentally will no longer be exposed to it, and we will have made a major step forward in the  health of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Isakson, Senator Boxer, Senator Inhofe, all of the people who have worked with us. But as we all know, we are doing this because we want America to be a safer place. I thank everybody for this major step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my colleague who has worked so hard with me on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today this body will pass comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to permanently ban the production, manufacture, and distribution of asbestos, a deadly carcinogen that is still legally used in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my honor and pleasure to work with Senator Murray on this legislation. I have nothing but the highest regard for the Senior Senator from Washington State. The Senator and her staff have worked tirelessly on this issue for several years, and I am eager to continue to work with her to assure passage of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also received invaluable cooperation and assistance from the Chair and Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators Boxer and Inhofe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When inhaled, asbestos is known to cause diseases including mesothelioma, a cancer that occurs when malignant cells develop in the protective lining around the lungs. Despite this hazard, the substance is not banned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The EPA initially proposed a ban of most asbestos-containing materials in the late 1970s. The rule was not finalized until 1989. Only 2 years later, however, the Fifth Circuit struck down the rule, finding that the EPA had "failed to muster substantial evidence" in support of the ban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the U.S. consumes about 2,000 tons of asbestos yearly, down from almost 800,000 tons consumed in the mid-1970s. Our bill will establish a permanent ban of asbestos that will be enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also mandates the most thorough Government study of asbestos to date. The study will ensure the best experts from the National Institute of Occupational Safety &amp; Health, the National Academy of Sciences and the EPA examine all aspects of asbestos, including its natural properties, its geographic distribution across the United States, and its effects on the human body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also calls for a national mesothelioma registry and a public information campaign about the hazards of asbestos-containing materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the few areas where asbestos is still used in the United States, this bill provides narrow exemptions or reasonable transitions to other alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is the culmination of months of bipartisan work to find common ground on this issue. With a sweeping bill such as this one, many issues were difficult to resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One difficult issue to resolve involved the treatment of nonasbestiform minerals. These so-called "cleavage fragments" are minerals that appear naturally and more abundantly than asbestos, are in land and dirt and are mined all across Georgia and in significant areas of the Nation. They are similar to asbestos in chemical makeup but differ significantly in structure and many other respects. The Federal Government has in the past through two decisions--one by OSHA, 1992 rulemaking, and one by  CPSC, 1988 decision--spoken to the lack of health risk from nonasbestiform minerals, and many published, peer-reviewed studies confirm those findings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill makes no presumption as to the health effects of nonasbestiform minerals but rather enlists the Nation's best scientists to study nonasbestiform minerals and elongated mineral particles, a term that includes, but is not limited to, asbestos and other biopersistent elongated mineral particles. It will be important in these studies to both  differentiate these minerals according to the asbestos-related health risks, and distinguish between these minerals as they are identified in the natural, mixed dust environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asbestos, the path of its deadly health effects, the identification and differentiation of asbestos from other minerals especially in the natural, mixed dust environment, are all complex areas of science and it is time for the Federal Government to pool its expertise scattered among a half-dozen agencies, to better understand the risks and how to properly identify the fibers of risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Murray is to be complimented for her skill in crafting a bill that provides what we intend to be a level playing field that will produce a better understanding of the why's and how's of life-threatening exposure to asbestos, how to accurately identify and measure it in the natural and mixed dust environments, and how to separate it from common everyday dirt and rocks critical to farming, homebuilding, construction and our everyday society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill provides for research by Government agencies including the world-renowned National Academy of Sciences, calling on their input into their input into the Federal studies, to assure peer review and consideration of the best science and studies available. It is essential that we bring the best science possible to bear on this most important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another difficult issue involved asbestos-based filters used in the production of chlorine. Our bill includes a reasonable compromise that protects the safety of the workers at these facilities and empowers the EPA to review the installations to ensure that the filters pose no unreasonable risk to workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I want to commend the hard work of our staff on this issue. Specifically, Bill Kamela with Senator Murray, Mary Anne Dunlap with Senator Inhofe, Grant Cope with Senator Boxer, Ed Egee from my staff, and Colin Campbell with the Office of Legislative Counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Banning asbestos is simply the right thing to do. This bill provides the framework for how this country must go about achieving this goal. I plan to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see it to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for her kind remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I tell everyone in this Chamber and everyone who reads about this event, without her championing this issue over the last 7 years, it would not have happened. She has been a marvelous champion on behalf of those who have suffered from asbestos-related diseases, in particular mesothelioma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have watched her encounter countless hurdles on what is a very complex issue and a very complex piece of legislation. She has done a marvelous job. Her staff member Bill Kamela has been a tremendous help, as has my staff member Ed Egee. It would not have happened without the two of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As was mentioned by Senator Murray, Senator Boxer has been the real champion and given us the platform, the framework, and the latitude in the  committee to work this through this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I entered the Congress in 1999, I had the privilege of meeting a gentleman by the name of Bruce Vento, a Congressman from the State of Minnesota. I only got to know Bruce for a short period of time, because a couple of years later his life was taken by mesothelioma. That was my first experience with it. His wife Sue has been an advocate, in countless appearances before the Congress, working toward a ban on asbestos. Today in Washington, Renee Hansen from my State of Georgia, Watkinsville,  who suffers from mesothelioma, is here today by chance advocating on behalf of those who suffer from that dreaded disease, and seeking the Congress of the United States to take the action this Senate has just taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country started 37 years ago by banning asbestos. But through court cases, through regulatory rulings, the ban never took place. Although the use of it has been restricted, as was stated by Senator Murray, it is used in countless products. This bill puts an end to asbestos. In those narrow exceptions of national defense, the space program, and a chlorine filter in a contained filter system, those are grandfathered, but with a system where they go out of business as replacements  that can substitute for them come in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of taking legislative descriptions, we took scientific evidence and declared scientific studies in the future to make the determinations to see to it that Americans are no longer exposed to life-threatening fibers known as asbestos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a privilege for me to work on many things in my legislative career, both back in Georgia and in the Congress, but I do not know that I have ever had a more rewarding experience than looking in the eyes of those whose families and lives who have been touched by mesothelioma, and tell them the Congress today is going to do something about banning asbestos and take the step that is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud to have walked in that march with Senator Murray and with Senator Boxer. I thank Senator Inhofe and his staff for their cooperation, who in the end made all of this possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, before Senator Boxer speaks, I want to thank all of my staff who have been involved in this. I will insert their names in the Record. Bill, Crystal, Alex, in my press shop, Mike, Pete, previous staff members have put in countless hours on this. Without them we would never do this. I certainly know that working with Senator Isakson's staff and the staff from EPW and Senator Boxer's staff. It takes a lot of people to get something  done. A tremendous amount of people have worked on this. I thank them. Because of their work, we are going to ban asbestos, we are going to dramatically expand research and treatment, and we are going to launch a public education campaign so all Americans understand how they can protect themselves from the deadly asbestos products that may be in their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I thank our chairwoman.</paragraph>

  <chair>Mrs BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for allowing us these few minutes to mark a very, I think, emotional moment for all of us and a very important moment for the health and the safety of the people of our Nation.</chair>
  <chair>The work of Senator Murray, that of Senator Wellstone in the past, and that of Senator Isakson, cannot be overstated. Because when the book is written on how a bill becomes a law, what you learn is that on something that has just a hint of controversy to it, you have to go through so many hurdles and so many late-night meetings and so many hours, and that is why the staffs deserve so much credit. In the Environment and Public Works Committee, Bettina Poirier, Grant Cope, and  Erik Olson are very important, and from the HELP Committee, Bill.</chair>
  <chair>Let me say, many countries have banned asbestos. As Senator Murray said, if you would ask a person in the street: Is asbestos banned? They would say, yes. But there was a court case many years ago which overturned that ban. So we have seen a tremendous amount of asbestos in the workplace, in consumer products, and the like. We still have more work to do. We have to get this through the House. We think there are friends in the House, remembering the wonderful Congressman Vento whom Senator</chair>
  <chair>Certainly we feel very good that the beloved Congressman will get this honor after his death. We want to say, his wife has been an extraordinary person in pushing this through.</chair>
  <chair>Today Senators Murray and Isakson got a standing ovation from the men and women who are suffering either from mesothelioma or their families who were there representing them or some whose families are here, although their loved one has perished. In this press conference I read a poem written by a beautiful woman, a Californian who lost her husband, and her agony as she watched her husband literally disappear before her eyes. I met a woman today whose son died at age 33 from  mesothelioma. They can't figure out exactly where the exposure came from. I saw his picture when he was 31, a vibrant, beautiful young man, his emaciated face, still handsome a couple years later, and then he was gone. This bill is so important, that we join the nations of the world who have already banned asbestos and say, there are moments here you feel proud of, you feel kind of proud of, you feel</chair>
  <chair>So we are here this day. It is emotional. It is a wonderful moment. I congratulate Senators Murray and Isakson. I am so proud I was in the right place at the right time to help them.</chair>

    <paragraph>When I went to law school, I can only remember one woman in my law school class. I went to George Washington. It was a large class. Women didn't go to law school much in those days. A few years later, I took the bar. It was a small group of men studying for the bar in Nevada. There may have been a couple women, but that was it. When I came to the Senate, Mikulski was the woman. She still is. Since that time, we have had the good fortune of having a significant number of women  elected to the Senate. Fortunately, most of them are on this side of the aisle. The Senate is a much better place because of women being here. The legal profession is a better profession now because of women being in it. Because as much as we joke about it, men and women are different. They think differently. I can testify to that as a result of having served in the Senate with a meager number of women and now with a significant number. The Senate would only be better if there were more women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my appreciation to Patty Murray, a woman of great stature, somebody who has persevered on an issue that when she started it, she was alone. She stood up during our battles we had here in recent years on asbestos liability, with her eyes pointed toward one thing this country should do, and that is not allow the importation of asbestos. That now has happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barbara Boxer, a kind, thoughtful person she is, with a heart as big as anybody's heart in the Senate. I knew from the very beginning this was something she wanted to do as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It has been done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnny Isakson is a conservative Republican from the State of Georgia. But he is a person who is mindful of the need to work together and get things done. I so admire his ability to work across party lines. As tenacious and hard working as these two women I have mentioned are, it couldn't have been done without Senator Isakson. This is a very important day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can remember so clearly Bruce Vento. Two examples, then I won't take any more time of Chairman Mikulski. I was a brand new House member, walking across Independence Avenue. He said: You should have a national park in Nevada. Because of him,  we got a national park in Nevada. The Great Basin National Park is in Nevada. Bruce Vento pointed me in the right direction and that is what we did. The most significant legislation I have ever offered  has been something in Nevada we call a negotiated settlement which involved two endangered species, two Indian tribes, 100-year water war between the States of California and Nevada. Wetlands had dried up from 100,000 acres to probably 1,000 putrid areas. It involved irrigation districts, the cities of Reno and Sparks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bruce Vento was on the floor in 1993, and by unanimous consent in the House worked his magic. It was late in the session, and it was the next to the last thing that passed that session. As happens over there late at night when they are trying to get things done, there was a lot of confusion going on, but he got it done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a wonderful day for the American people. We will get this through the House and this will be signed by the President. I feel so happy that this is done for so many different reasons.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her efforts to end the use of asbestos in the United States. America should join the more than 40 other countries that have banned its use. This is an issue where the devastating health effects of asbestos far outweigh the economic benefits of its continued widespread use. It is surprising to me that there is any significant debate in light of what we know about the deadliness of this substance, and the tremendous suffering of so  many Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 10,000 people die each year from asbestos-related disease. Asbestos is among the most lethal substances ever to be widely used in the workplace. Between 1940 and 1980, more than 27.5 million workers were exposed to asbestos on the job, and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time. We even know of family members who have suffered asbestos-related disease from washing the clothes of loved ones. The ravages of disease caused by asbestos have affected  tens of thousands of American families. Given what we know about asbestos, we should not permit the immense suffering its use has caused to continue any longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Murray's bill is a step in the right direction toward a more comprehensive solution to this problem. I am glad this bill contains provisions for increased research and education concerning asbestos. Preventing future exposure is a good thing, but we must do more to address the terrible suffering that continues in the United States and we owe it to those who have been affected to enact an effective system for their care and compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I would have preferred to have retained the more extensive provisions contained in the comprehensive bipartisan bill then-Judiciary Committee Chairman SPECTER and I proposed in the 109th Congress, I believe that if enacted, this legislation will save many lives in the future. We owe it to all Americans to do everything we can to end the use of asbestos and to confront the terrible legacy this deadly substance has left behind.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Before my three colleagues who have accomplished this significant feat leave the floor, I, too, wish to salute them. Dear colleagues, what an emotional day. First, our good friend Senator Wellstone embarked on that with you, Senator Murray, many years ago. Paul is no longer with us. His legacy lives on. There is a saying I learned in Catholic girls school: exegi aani perrenius. I will build a monument in lasting bronze. And when one thinks about a monument to Paul Wellstone,  the kind of wise guy he was, he wouldn't be a marble guy or want some bronze statue. He would want this as a memorial that others might live. As a Senator from Maryland, my State is a manufacturing State. In my shipyards, there was so much asbestos. To this day, the shipyard workers of Baltimore and Fairfield, Bethlehem Steel, people who built the liberty ships, the ones who helped win the battle of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me today to know that when we talked about better things through chemistry, the answer was yes, but what we did without realizing it was subject our American citizens to such unbelievable pain. So for the guys at the shipyards, we say to Murray, to Boxer, and to Isakson: Anchors aweigh, my boys and girls, anchors aweigh.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and our floor staff on both sides of the aisle who helped us. They know that Senator Isakson and I dogged them every single day, every single minute of the way until we got this done. Without their help we couldn't be here either. I will end by saying I have looked in the eyes of too many people who have lost a loved one to a product that contained asbestos because they went to work and didn't know they were being exposed. To all of those  people who have stuck with us and worked with us and fought with us--some of them are here in the Senate with us today--we wouldn't be here without you and your passion. Because of that, we are changing the world to a better place.</paragraph>
