  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 1914. A bill to require a comprehensive nuclear posture review, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1914">S. 1914</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Casey to introduce legislation to authorize a comprehensive review of our nuclear weapons policy and posture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before we ramp up funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program as the administration has requested, we should have a clear, bipartisan consensus on the role nuclear weapons will play in our national security strategy and the impact they will have on our nuclear nonproliferation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nuclear Policy and Posture Review Act of 2007 does three things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it authorizes the President to conduct a nuclear policy review to consider a range of possible roles of nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy. The administration may reach out to outside experts and conduct public hearings to get a wide range of views. The policy review will provide options and recommendations for a nuclear posture review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This report is due on September 1, 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, following the completion of the nuclear policy review, it authorizes the Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive review of the nuclear posture of the U.S. to clarify U.S. nuclear deterrence policy and strategy. This report is due March 1, 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it zeros out funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program until the policy review and posture review reports have been submitted to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his testimony on March 29, 2007, before the House Energy &amp; Water Appropriations Subcommittee, former Senator Sam Nunn, Chairman of Nuclear Threat Initiative, noted that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the [Reliable Replacement Warhead] itself, if Congress gives a green light to this program in our current world environment, I believe that this will be: misunderstood by our allies; exploited by our adversaries; complicate our work to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons and ..... make resolution of the Iran and North Korea challenges all the more difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not agree more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, I remain deeply concerned about this administration's nuclear weapons policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a U.S. Senator, I have worked with colleagues in the House and Senate to stop the re-opening of the nuclear door and the development of new nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, we have eliminated funding for the Advanced Concepts Initiative, the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, and the Modern Pit Facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were consequential victories but the fight is far from over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For fiscal year 2008, the administration requested $118 million for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program; $88 million in the National Nuclear Security administration's budget and $30 million in the Department of Defense's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These funds would be used for Phase 2A activities: design definition and cost study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would represent approximately a four-fold increase over fiscal year 2007 funding of $24.7 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House, however, rejected the administration's request and zeroed out funding for RRW in its fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. In its report accompanying the legislation, the House cited the lack of a definitive nuclear weapons policy review as a key reason for withholding funding for what will be a costly new nuclear warhead program. It stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lack of any definitive analysis or strategic assessment defining the objectives of a future nuclear stockpile makes it impossible to weigh the relative merits of investing billions of taxpayer dollars in new nuclear weapon production activities when the United States is facing the problem of having too large a stockpile as a Cold War legacy. Currently, there exists no convincing rationale for maintaining the large number of existing Cold War nuclear weapons, much less producing additional  warheads, or for the DoD requirements that drive the management of the DOE nuclear weapons complex.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Senate bill did not follow suit, it did cut $22 million from the administration's request, for a total of $66 million, and restricted activities to Phase 2A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we can match the House's action and this bill would do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration is clearly getting nervous about the prospects for funding for RRW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday, the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and State released a 4-page white paper on nuclear weapons strategy: "National Security and Nuclear Weapons: Maintaining Deterrence in the 21st Century". It affirmed the importance of maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent and sought to justify funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. Among other things, it stated that the Reliable Replacement Warhead program is critical to sustaining long-term confidence in the nuclear stockpile  and will help reduce the stockpile and move us away from nuclear testing; and any delay to the program will force the U.S. to maintain a larger stockpile, invest in costly and risky Life Extension Programs, and increase the likelihood that we will have to resume nuclear testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These arguments simply do not stand up to scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed the evidence clearly shows that there is no need to rush forward with increased funding for RRW. Let us take a close look at the status of our nuclear weapons arsenal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are there currently problems with the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, for each of the past 11 years the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Defense have certified that the nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Has the Pentagon asked for a new warhead for new missions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, there is no new military requirement to replace existing, well-tested warheads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about the plutonium pit, the "trigger" of a nuclear weapon? In past years, the administration requested funding for a Modern Pit Facility that could build up to 450  pits a year arguing that the pits in our current stockpile were reaching the end of their life-span.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is our stockpile at risk due to aging pits?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, a December 2006 report by the National Laboratories showed that plutonium pits have a life-span of at least 85 years, and possibly up to 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That report validated Congressional action to eliminate funding for the Modern Pit Facility. I am pleased that the administration listened and did not request funding for the facility in fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are we at risk for resuming nuclear testing?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, as I have argued our stockpile is safe and secure and will clearly remain so for the foreseeable future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the likelihood of resuming nuclear testing is increasing it is due to the fact that the administration has, in past years, requested funding to lower the time to test readiness at the Nevada test site from 24-36 months to 18 months and, above all, refused to support ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about costs? I find it interesting that the administration would cite the costs of successful Life Extension Programs as a reason to ramp up funding for the RRW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Has the administration shared with us what it will cost to replace the warhead on our deployed nuclear arsenal with a new Reliable Replacement Warhead?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer is no. The administration has remained silent about when the supposed cost savings from RRW will ultimately kick in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the development of a new nuclear warhead will likely add billions of dollars to the American taxpayer's bill at a time when, as noted above, the stockpile is safe and reliable. As the House Energy and Water Appropriations report argued:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under any realistic future U.S. nuclear defense scenario, the existing legacy stockpile will continue to provide the nation's nuclear deterrent for well over the next two to three decades. The effort by the NNSA to apply urgency to developing a significant production capacity for the RRW while lacking any urgency to rationalize an oversized complex appears to mean simply more costs to the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before we move any further with this program which would add a new warhead to the stockpile, we should have a better understanding of the role nuclear weapons will play in our security policy in a post-Cold War and post 9/11 world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we as a country are going to move away from massive stockpiles of nuclear weapons and explore more conventional alternatives, does it make sense to add a new warhead to the stockpile?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are committed to strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, what impact would a Reliable Replacement Warhead have on those efforts?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the Life Extension Program can certify the safety and the reliability of our existing nuclear stockpile, should we shift resources from RRW to more pressing concerns?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is common sense to ask these questions and engage in comprehensive review and debate about these options before we make the decision on manufacturing new warheads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it stands now, we are addressing this issue backwards and behind closed doors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is, we are rushing to develop a new warhead without an understanding of the role it will play in our nuclear weapons policy and national security strategy and without public input that will lead to a bipartisan policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us be clear: a rushed, four page white paper is simply not sufficient to answer these questions and make decisions about developing new nuclear warheads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has promised a more detailed report but its haste to put out this paper suggests that it is more intent on rushing the development of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program than in taking a sober,  unbiased look at our nuclear weapons policy and posture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lack of a substantive debate and review means we are not paying sufficient attention to the potential negative consequences of RRW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speeding up the development of a new nuclear warhead may send the wrong message to Iran; North Korea; and other would-be nuclear weapon states and encourage the very proliferation we are trying to prevent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What to us may appear to be a safer, more reliable weapon could appear to others to be a new weapon with new missions and a violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Association for the Advancement of Science issued a report last month acknowledging that a Reliable Replacement Warhead "could lead to a final selected design that is certifiable without a nuclear test."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, the report also concluded that absent a comprehensive review of nuclear policy and stockpile needs, the purpose and intention of RRW could be widely misinterpreted abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pointing out that there has been no high level statement about nuclear weapons policy since the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, it called on the administration to develop a bipartisan policy on the future of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons policy before moving ahead with RRW. It stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the absence of a clear nuclear posture, many interpretations are possible [about U.S. nuclear weapons policy] and the lack of a national understanding and consensus on the role of U.S. nuclear weapons puts any new approach at considerable risk at home and abroad. For example, an RRW plan that emphasizes the goal of sustaining the deterrent without nuclear testing could be perceived quite differently from one that focuses on future flexibility to develop and deploy nuclear weapons for new military  mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on to state:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... nuclear weapons are ultimately an instrument of policy and strategy rather than of war fighting, and only with the leadership of the president can there be major changes in that instrument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately we have not seen such leadership from this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because it pursued the development of low-yield nuclear weapons and a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, because it sought to lower the time-to-test readiness at the Nevada test site from 24-26 months to 18 months, because it sought to build a Modern Pit Facility that could produce up to 450 pits a year, this administration has lost the credibility to take a fresh and open look at nuclear weapons policy and posture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only a new administration, free from the constraints of the heated debates of the past, will have the authority to conduct a comprehensive review of our nuclear weapons policy and posture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bipartisan consensus on this policy is essential. It will let the world know exactly where we stand on these important issues and help clear up any confusion about our intentions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Friend and foe alike will know that regardless of who holds power in Congress or the White House, the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy will not change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will strengthen our efforts to convince other states to forego the development of nuclear weapons and make the world safer from the threat of nuclear war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that bipartisan policy is beginning to emerge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a January 4, 2007 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, "A World Free of Nuclear Weapons", George Schultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and Sam Nunn laid out a compelling vision for a world free of the threat of nuclear war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They laid a set of common sense steps the U.S. and other nuclear weapon states can take to make this happen including: taking nuclear weapons off high-alert status; substantially reducing the size of nuclear stockpiles; eliminating short-ranged nuclear weapons; ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; securing all stocks of weapons, weapons-usable plutonium, and highly enriched uranium around the world; getting control of the uranium enrichment process; stopping production of fissile material  for nuclear weapons globally; resolving regional confrontations that encourage the development of nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They conclude:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal would be, and would be perceived as, a bold initiative consistent with America's moral heritage. The effort could have a profoundly positive impact on the security of future generations. Without that bold vision, the actions will not be perceived as fair or urgent. Without the actions, the vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should pay close attention to these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, let me say that there is a big difference between an RRW program that increases the reliability of the existing stockpile and one that leads to a resumption of nuclear testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should ask the tough questions to ensure that this is not a back door to new nuclear weapons with new missions and new rounds of testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe we should zero out for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program until the next administration takes a serious look at our nuclear weapons programs and issues a bipartisan policy on the size of the future stockpile, testing, and nuclear nonproliferation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to craft that sensible, bipartisan nuclear weapons policy that will make Americans safe and allow us to reclaim a leadership role in the fight against nuclear proliferation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 1918. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to expand the definition of firefighter to include apprentices and trainees, regardless of age or duty limitations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1918">S. 1918</bill>] Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the Christopher Kangas Fallen Firefighter Apprentice Act, a bill designed to correct a flaw in the current definition of "firefighter" under the Public Safety Officer Benefits Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 4, 2002, 14-year-old Christopher Kangas was struck by a car and killed while he was riding his bicycle in Brookhaven, PA. The local authorities later confirmed that Christopher was out on his bike that day for an important reason: Chris Kangas was a junior firefighter, and he was responding to a fire emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Pennsylvania law, 14- and 15-year-olds such as Christopher are permitted to serve as volunteer junior firefighters. While they are not allowed to operate heavy machinery or enter burning buildings, the law permits them to fill a number of important support roles, such as providing first aid. In addition, the junior firefighter program is an important recruitment tool for fire stations throughout the Commonwealth. In fact, prior to his death Christopher had received 58 hours of training  that would have served him well when he graduated from the junior program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to me that Christopher Kangas was a firefighter killed in the line of duty. Were it not for his status as a junior firefighter and his prompt response to a fire alarm, Christopher would still be alive today. Indeed, the Brookhaven Fire Department, Brookhaven Borough, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have all recognized Christopher as a fallen public safety officer and provided the appropriate death benefits to his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, while those closest to the tragedy have recognized Christopher as a fallen firefighter, the Federal Government has not. The U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ, determined that Christopher Kangas was not eligible for benefits because he was not acting within a narrow range of duties at the time of his death that are the measured criteria to be considered a "firefighter," and therefore, was not a "public safety officer" for purposes of the Public Safety Officer Benefits Act. In order to be  eligible for benefits under the Public Safety Officer Benefits Act, an officer's death must be considered the "direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty." Although the United States Code includes firefighters in the definition of "public safety officer" and specifies a firefighter as "an individual serving as an officially-recognized or designated member of a legally-organized volunteer fire department;" it offers no definition of "line of duty". DOJ had to defer to an arbitrarily narrow</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, Christopher's family has been pursuing this benefit through our court system. The U.S. Federal Claims Court ruled in favor of the Kangas family ordering the Department of Justice to pay $250,000. However, the Department appealed the decision which the Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit upheld by concluding the Court of Federal Claims' decision failed to defer to DOJ's interpretation of "firefighter."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any firefighter will tell you that there are many important roles to play in fighting a fire beyond operating the hoses and ladders. Firefighting is a team effort, and everyone in the Brookhaven Fire Department viewed young Christopher as a full member of their team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of this DOJ determination, Christopher's family cannot receive a $267,000 Federal line-of-duty benefit. In addition, Christopher is barred from taking his rightful place on the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD. For a young man who dreamed of being a firefighter and gave his life rushing to a fire, keeping him off of the memorial is a grave injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I introduce today will ensure that the Federal Government will recognize Christopher Kangas and others like him as firefighters. The bill clarifies that all firefighters will be recognized as such "regardless of age, status as an apprentice or trainee, or duty restrictions imposed because of age or status as an apprentice or trainee." The bill applies retroactively back to May 4, 2002, the date of Christopher Kangas' death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="Introducing S. 1919. A bill to establish trade enforcement priorities for the United States, to strengthen the provisions relating to trade remedies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1919">S. 1919</bill>] Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Hatch to introduce the Trade Enforcement Act of 2007. This bill will provide the administration additional tools, resources, and accountability to enforce international trade agreements abroad and domestic trade remedy laws here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 400 years ago, William Shakespeare wrote "The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept." The same could be said of our trade enforcement laws today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has many tools at its disposal to enforce international trade agreements. It can file dispute settlement cases in the World Trade Organization, WTO. It has Section 301 to fight market access barriers. It has Special 301 to address intellectual property violations abroad. It has Section 421 to remedy Chinese import surges that cause injury here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But having these rules on the books is not enough. We need to enforce them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a very real sense among Americans that our trading partners do not play by the rules. And there is a very real sense that the U.S. Government is allowing them to get away with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am introducing the Trade Enforcement Act of 2007--to ensure that the administration has the resources to enforce our existing trade laws, to provide political accountability when it does not, and to create new tools that address the enforcement priorities of American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service suppliers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation bolsters enforcement of U.S. trade agreements in three important ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it requires the U.S. Trade Representative, USTR, to dedicate more time to enforcement. The bill requires USTR to provide an annual report to Congress identifying the most significant barriers to U.S. companies abroad and to take enforcement action to resolve them. It also makes trade enforcement more accountable to Congress. The bill allows the Senate Finance Committee or the House Ways and Means Committee to require USTR to identify a specific barrier in its annual report. And, significantly,  the bill creates a Senate-confirmed Chief Enforcement Officer at USTR to investigate and prosecute trade enforcement cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill addresses serious concerns that have been raised about the quality of recent World Trade Organization dispute settlement decisions. It does so by establishing a commission of retired judges and international trade law experts to review the decisions and determine whether they impose obligations on the U.S. that are not found in the text of the WTO agreements. The bill also prevents the administration from changing a regulation to comply with an adverse WTO decision until Congress  receives the commission's report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill ensures that other U.S. government agencies do not use foreign policy and other noneconomic rationales to block USTR from taking tough enforcement actions. It clarifies that while USTR must carefully consider any advice provided by the interagency trade organization established under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, it need not, and shall not, seek approval of its actions from the organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also bolsters enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws in four important ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill limits the President's discretion to deny relief in Section 421 cases to address Chinese import surges. This administration has utterly failed to use this trade remedy as Congress intended. It has denied relief in every case where the International Trade Commission, ITC, determined that relief was warranted. Our bill remedies this deficiency by requiring the President to proclaim any import relief that the ITC recommends unless the President finds, in extraordinary cases, that  the relief would seriously harm our national security or would have an adverse impact on our economy that clearly and significantly outweighs the benefits. Congress may override the economic determination and reinstate the ITC's decision if it enacts a joint resolution of disapproval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill makes it easier for U.S. companies to obtain relief from subsidized imports from certain countries. It clarifies that the Commerce Department may apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies like China. The Commerce Department has long taken the position that our countervailing duty laws do not apply to nonmarket economies, and it has refused to do so until very recently. The bill closes this loophole and eliminates any remaining uncertainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the bill makes it easier for U.S. companies to obtain relief from subsidized and dumped imports from all countries by overriding the Federal Circuit's recent Bratsk decision. The bill provides that the ITC must make its injury determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases without regard to whether imports from other countries are likely to replace imports from the country under investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the bill increases intellectual property expertise at the ITC. It authorizes the ITC to appoint hearing officers, rather than administrative law judges, ALJs, to take evidence and make initial decisions in intellectual property investigations under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Unlike the current ALJs, the hearing officers would be required to have technical expertise and experience in intellectual property law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The overarching goal of this bill is, as Shakespeare might say, to "wake up" our trade laws from their current slumber and ensure that the administration enforces them to the fullest extent. Our farmers, ranchers, and companies deserve nothing less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I therefore hope that my colleagues will support the Trade Enforcement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Getting Retention and Diplomas Up Among Today's Enrolled Students Act" or the "GRADUATES Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Since almost 90 percent of the fastest growing and best paying jobs now require some postsecondary education, a secondary school diploma and the skills to succeed in higher education and the modern workplace are essential.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Only  1/3  of all high school students in the United States graduate in 4 years prepared for a 4-year institution of higher education. Another  1/3  graduate, but without the skills and qualifications necessary for success in higher education or the workplace, and the rest will not graduate from high school in 4 years, if at all.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Dropouts from the class of 2006 will cost the United States more that $309,000,000,000 in reduced earnings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The Nation's failure to meet the increasing demand for skilled workers means that American companies cannot fill a large number of jobs. 81 percent of American manufacturing companies report experiencing a moderate to severe shortage of qualified workers.</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) International competition has made education a national security issue. For example, the United States currently runs a $30,000,000,000 advanced technology trade deficit with China. Many other countries are developing the technology, infrastructure, and knowledge base to export quality products with inexpensive labor. The education system of the United States should support critical thinking, creativity, and innovative approaches to new opportunities, which are commodities that cannot be  outsourced.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) As the bar for success continues to be raised, the responsibility to engender these attributes with progressive programs and original models lies squarely with the education system. It is imperative that the United States develop and implement new, innovative approaches to fully prepare every student for the 21st century.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Realigning the education system to meet new, demanding requirements and face intensifying competition requires effective, systemic reform. Identifying effective, replicable models that achieve this goal is a critical step towards enhancing the prospects of all students entering the modern workforce.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="Introducing S. 1921. A bill to amend the American Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 to extend the authorization for that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1921">S. 1921</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague Senator JEFF SESSIONS and 14 of our Senate colleagues to introduce the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2007. This bipartisan legislation was recently introduced in the House by Congressmen GARY MILLER of California and BART GORDON of Tennessee and presently enjoys the support of 26 Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill is a straightforward, 5 year extension of the 2002 Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act. The purpose of this legislation remains the same as when Congress first passed it: to preserve and protect nationally significant Civil War battlefields through conservation easements and fee-simple purchases of battlefield sites. In addition, the legislation fosters partnerships among State and local governments, regional entities, and the private sector to preserve, conserve, and enhance nationally  significant Civil War battlefields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation continues to protect private property rights by limiting land acquisitions to willing sellers only. It also requires a 50-50 match in order for projects to be eligible to receive Federal funds. Finally, the program limits the effect on the burgeoning National Park Service's maintenance backlog because non-Federal entities are responsible for the long-term maintenance of sites not within National Park Service boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, Congress established the Civil War Sites Advisory commission, a blue-ribbon panel empowered to investigate the status of America's remaining Civil War battlefields. Congress tasked the commission with the mission of prioritizing these battlefields according to their historic importance and the threats to their survival. The commission ultimately looked at the 10,000-plus battles and skirmishes of the Civil War and determined that 384 priority sites should be preserved. The results of  the report were released in 1993 and they were not encouraging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1993 commission report recommended that Congress create an emergency program to save threatened Civil War battlefield land. The result was the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program, which was first funded  in fiscal year 1999 and originally authorized in 2002. To date, the preservation program has saved over 14,000 acres of land in 15 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key to the success of the preservation program is that it achieves battlefield preservation through collaborative partnerships between State and local governments, the private sector and nonprofit organizations, such as the Civil War Preservation Trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for the preservation program and its non-Federal partners, we would have lost key sites from national shrines at Antietam. Chancellorsville. Fredericksburg. Manassas. Harpers Ferry. Bentonville. Mansfield. Champion Hill. Their names of these legendary battlegrounds continue to haunt us to this day. Had the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program not been available as a tool to preserve threatened battlefield land, these sites and others like them would have surely been lost forever to  commercial and residential development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not every day you can visit battlefield sites and have an immediate, direct connection with your ancestors. We must preserve these sites so that future generations might see and touch the very places where so many sacrifices were made, by soldiers and civilians alike. We are a stronger, more diverse and free Nation because of these sacrifices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would remind my colleagues that the preservation program has enjoyed bipartisan, bicameral support since its inception. In 2002, program funding was authorized through the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act at the level recommended by the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission, $10 million a year. These Federal funds have, and will continue to, leverage millions more in private and other charitable donations; thereby increasing our ability to preserve more threatened battlefield sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act has become an essential tool for protecting our nation's Civil War battlefields. I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to reauthorize this important federal program. The clock is ticking against these threatened historical sites and we must keep the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program as a valuable tool to preserve them.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 1922. A bill to apply basic contracting laws to the Transportation Security Administration; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1922">S. 1922</bill>] Mr. President, today Senator SNOWE and I are introducing the TSA Acquisition Reform Act of 2007 to repeal exemptions from Federal contracting laws that were granted to the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, after 9/11 in the rush to secure airports. Representative Carney has introduced identical legislation in the House and I look forward to working with him to improve contracting at TSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TSA is one of the few Federal agencies and the only agency within the Department of Homeland Security that is not subject to the same procurement rules that every other Federal agency, including the Department of Defense, must abide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, it is exempt from the Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR, which covers every major procurement law and requires Federal agencies to provide for an open and competitive bidding process and submit contract information to the Federal Procurement Data System. TSA's exemption from the FAR was never meant to be permanent, and this amendment would bring the agency in line with normal Federal contracting rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TSA has a record of mismanaging contracts and wasting taxpayer dollars, and has been the subject of several DOT and DHS Inspector General reports. For instance, in 2002, TSA, despite using FAR guidelines, issued a federally prohibited cost-plus-a-percentage contract to Boeing to install explosive detection systems in airports. In September 2004, the IG found that the initial $508 million contract ballooned to $1.2 billion, that Boeing was paid $49 million in excess profit, received $82 million  to cover $39 million in costs, and ultimately received a 210 percent return on its investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Washington Post reported on an audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency which showed that a contract issued to the Pearson government solutions firm to recruit Federal passenger screeners increased in cost from $104 million to $741 million in 9 months in part because TSA changed the scope of the contract to require Pearson to use posh hotels, including the Waldorf Astoria, as recruitment centers. TSA disputes this account, but cannot provide any paperwork to back it up. The article  quoted Deputy DHS Secretary Michael Jackson as saying, "Honestly, I have no memory of it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, the when the GAO wanted to review 21 TSA contracts, it literally had to send staff to rummage through boxes of files to retrieve information that would otherwise have been in the Federal Procurement Data System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chairman of the Small Business Committee, I am particular concerned about TSA's inability to meet its small business contracting goals. I am pleased that the 2007 DHS Appropriations bill applied the Small Business Act to TSA, but small business owners won't  truly benefit because TSA is still exempt from basic contracting rules under the FAR that helps them compete for Federal contracts. Although TSA's small business contracting goal is 23 percent annually, only 10.7 percent of its contracts went to small businesses in 2005. Analysis conducted by my staff suggest that the true figure is closer to 6 percent because many of the large corporations that contract with TSA set up subsidiaries that technically qualify as small businesses but are in fact  part of a larger corporation. I am concerned about this and I know that my colleague, Senator SNOWE, the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, is concerned as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another important reason to require TSA to follow the FAR. DHS, which encompasses 22 different agencies, is trying to create a unified procurement system and a common culture within the department. The Comptroller General noted last year before the House Homeland Security Committee that "the various acquisition organizations within DHS are still operating in a disparate manner, with oversight of acquisition activities left primarily up to each individual component." How can DHS create  a common contracting system when the agency that spends the most money on contracts within the department is exempt from the department's own rules?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be wrong to suggest that exemption from FAR is the main reason that TSA has mismanaged contracts. Its acquisition office was understaffed after 9/11, and there was a rush to meet Congressional deadlines that led to sloppy oversight. I understand that TSA has spent millions to improve its contracting office and I commend it for doing so. However, it is far from clear that TSA has a functional procurement system. A 2006 GAO review of the ongoing Boeing contract suggests that poor contracting  oversight continues to plague TSA. The report states that "TSA officials provided no evidence that they are reviewing required contractor submitted performance data," and that they "do not document their activities because there are no TSA policies and procedures requiring them to do so. I know all Members would agree that this is a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, lack of transparency and accountability are common themes in TSA's procurement history. Former DHS IG Kent Ervin has said that "TSA is rapidly becoming the poster child for contracting dysfunction." Citizens Against Government Waste, which has endorsed this amendment, said in a letter to my office that "TSA has a record of wasteful spending and mismanagement in its acquisition process and a continued exemption will only lead to more abuse." I think we would be remiss in our  oversight responsibilities if we did not repeal these exemptions. TSA should not be policing itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not alone with these concerns. Just ask the Professional Services Council, the Nation's largest trade association representing Government contractors. In a letter to sent to my office yesterday, the PSC stated that my amendment will "increase competition, expand opportunities for small businesses, provide greater accountability and transparency in their procurement process." This judgment comes from the association representing the contractors that do business with TSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, TSA sent a letter to my office saying that it follows the FAR as a general rule but that its exemption "benefits taxpayers." Amazingly, TSA criticized the FAR's requirement that Federal agencies consider all interested companies in the bidding process, saying that "negatively impacts the limited resources of the government." It is hard to see how taxpayers benefit when an agency has the ability to opt out of the competitive bidding process at its choosing. The Army, Marines, Navy,  Air Force, none of these agencies can simply decide to opt out of the FAR unless they meet the criteria for an exemption which is already provided for under the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is simple: apply the same rules to TSA that every other agency has to follow. There is no legitimate reason to maintain these exemptions--not for efficiency, not for national security. If it is good enough for the Department of Defense, it is good enough for TSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with Senator SNOWE and Representative CARNEY to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="Introducing S. 1925. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act, to prevent credit card issuers from taking unfair advantage of college students and their parents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1925">S. 1925</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Student Credit Card Protection Act of 2007 with my colleagues Senators SMITH, MCCASKILL, SANDERS, and DURBIN. This legislation will help prevent college students from compiling massive credit card debt while in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>College students have become the target of credit card companies advertising campaigns over the past 15 years. Many universities allow credit card companies to set up tables on campus and offer students free gifts in exchange for filling out a credit card application. Additionally, students receive card solicitations through mail to their on-campus mailbox or at their home address even before they arrive at the university in the fall. These aggressive marketing strategies have worked and now  close to 96 percent of college graduates hold a credit card, compared to 1994, when only half had one. The average college student graduates with close to $3,000 in credit card debt, double the amount in 1994. In some very extreme cases, students are leaving school with multiple credit cards and debts amounting upwards of $10,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Credit card debt can make it harder for graduates to rent an apartment, receive a car loan, or obtain a job after college. Due to the lack of financial education and complicated terms and conditions, many students find themselves in over their heads. The Student Credit Card Protection Act will help students avoid large credit card debt while forcing issuers to make more responsible loans. The bill requires credit card issuers to verify annual income of a full-time student and then extends a line  of credit based on the income. For a student without a verifiable income, a parent, legal guardian or spouse must co-sign the credit card and approve any increase in the credit limit. These simple underwriting requirements will make it more difficult for credit card companies to approve loans that are beyond a students' ability to repay and return to a more responsible lending policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that we help minimize the amount of debt young consumers incur before entering into the workforce. On average, a student with a bachelors degree will leave school with $18,000 in student loan debt. Paying for housing, healthcare, and student loans already place a financial strain on a recent college graduate. A huge credit card payment on top of all card of the other bills can lead to financial ruin before young people even have a chance to get on their feet. This bill gives  students the protection they deserve from irresponsible lending that can trap them in years of crushing debt repayment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="Introducing S. 1926. A bill to establish the National Infrastructure Bank to provide funding for qualified infrastructure projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1926">S. 1926</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to introduce bipartisan legislation with my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel. The bill addresses an issue of paramount importance to our country and its quality of life: the deteriorating condition of our infrastructure systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not believe there is one person present in this chamber, funding myself, who has not taken our Nation's infrastructure systems for granted at some point. Indeed, our roads, bridges, mass transit systems, drinking water systems, wastewater systems, and public housing properties, collectively comprise the overlooked but critically important adhesive that holds our society together. These systems allow for the continuous passage of people and goods across the country; they allow people to communicate  with each other here and around the world; they allow business and Government to function; and they allow goods to be consumed and services to be rendered. All in all, our infrastructure systems are directly responsible for providing the high quality of life that we Americans have come to enjoy in a free society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, it is precisely because we have taken our infrastructure systems for granted that we find ourselves in a precarious position today concerning their future viability. One does not have to look far to comprehend the extensive problems plaguing many of our infrastructure systems and facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the American Society of Civil Engineers in their seminal 2005 Infrastructure Report Card, the current condition of our Nation's major infrastructure systems earns a grade point average of D and jeopardizes the prosperity and quality of life of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Federal Highway Administration, 33 percent of all urban and rural roads are in poor, mediocre or fair condition. 27.1 percent of all bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Data from the Federal Transit Administration shows our mass transit systems are becoming increasingly unable to handle the growing demands passengers in a safe and efficient manner. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, the average traveler is delayed 51.5 hours annually due  to traffic and infrastructure-related congestion in the Nation's  20 largest metropolitan areas. The delays range from 93 hours in Los Angeles to 14 hours in Pittsburgh. Combined, these delays waste 1.78 billion gallons of fuel each year and waste almost $50.3 billion in congestion costs. Furthermore, the average delay in these metropolitan areas has increased by almost 35.3 hours since 1982.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A significant percentage of our Nation's drinking water and wastewater systems are obsolete; the average age of these systems range in age from 50 years in smaller cities to 100 years in larger cities. Finally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development reports there are 1.2 million units of public housing with critical capital needs totaling $18 billion. Clearly, these statistics are alarming and they are not getting any better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In their Infrastructure Report Card, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a 5-year period to bring our Nation's infrastructure systems to a good condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, our current infrastructure financing mechanisms, such as formula grants and earmarks, are not equipped by themselves to absorb this cost or meet fully these growing needs. They largely do not address capacity-building infrastructure projects of regional or national significance; they largely do not encourage an appropriate pooling of Federal, State, local and private resources; and they largely do not provide transparency to ensure the optimal return on public resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I rise with my colleague from Nebraska today. We are introducing the National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007, a bipartisan measure that addresses the critical needs of our Nation's major infrastructure systems. Our legislation establishes a new method through which the Federal Government can finance infrastructure projects of substantial regional or national significance more effectively with public and private capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation establishes the National Infrastructure Bank, which, as an independent entity of the Government, is tasked with evaluating and financing capacity-building infrastructure projects of substantial regional and national significance. Infrastructure projects that come under the bank's consideration are publicly-owned mass transit systems, housing properties, roads, bridges, drinking water systems, and wastewater systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank is led by a 5 member Board of Directors, each whom are appointed by the Prsident and confirmed by the Senate. The bank's board has flexibility to develop an organization of professional civil service staff to carry out the bank's authorized activities. An Inspector General oversees the bank's daily operations and reports on those operations to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Infrastructure projects with a potential Federal investment of at least $75 million are brought to the bank's attention by a project sponsor, State, locality, tribe, infrastructure agency, e.g. transit agency, a consortium of these entities. To determine a level of Federal investment, the bank uses a sliding-scale method that incorporates conditions such as the type of infrastructure system or systems, project location, project cost, current and projected usage, non-Federal revenue, regional  or national significance, promotion of economic growth and community development, reduction in traffic congestion, environmental benefits, land use policies that promote smart growth, and mobility improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once a level of investment is determined for a project, the bank develops a financing package with full faith and credit from the government. The financing package could include direct subsidies, direct loan guarantees, long-term tax-credit general purpose bonds, and long-term tax-credit infrastructure project specific bonds. The initial ceiling to issue bonds is $60 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bank is tasked to report annually to Congress on the projects it reviews and finances. A public database is created to catalog what projects were funded and what financing packages were provided. The bank is also tasked to report every 3 years on the economic efficacy and transparency of all current Federal infrastructure financing methods, and how those methods could be improved. After 5 years, the Government Accountability Office would be tasked with evaluating the bank's operations and  efficacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that our legislation does not displace or supplant any existing infrastructure finance mechanisms, such as formula grants and earmarks. Instead, the bank targets large-scale projects that are currently underserved by these existing financing mechanisms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to thank the Centers for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, and the work undertaken by Dr. John Hamre in infrastucture finance. CSIS, Ambassador Felix Rohatyn, and former Senator Warren Rudman have provided valuable assistance and support in the development of our legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the American Society of Civil Engineers and the National Construction Alliance for their support of our bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my intent to take up this legislation in the Banking Committee after the August recess. This is an issue that cannot be neglected or deferred any further. Restoring our Nation's infrastructure demands our immediate attention and commitment in the Senate. The quality of life in our country hangs in the balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

Signatories included senators, governors, and business leaders, all recognizing the need for action.</narrative>
  <narrative>You have acted. While CSIS cannot endorse specific legislation, we can congratulate you as leaders. From the very first days of our republic, our national leaders saw the need for public investment in productive infrastructure. Public investment produced wealth-generating private sector activity, paying back the public investment many times over.</narrative>
  <narrative>The commission also called for infrastructure investments made through a rigorous cost-benefit process. Too much public investment in recent years has been earmarked for projects that have not gone through an analytic justification. Your leadership here is also most welcome.</narrative>
  <narrative>I travel extensively and see how infrastructure investments are transforming the developing world. Faced by this competition, America needs to make public infrastructure a comparable priority as a national re-investment to ensure our future prosperity.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your leadership. This is the kind of vision that built America to greatness in the past and will be our path to prosperity in the future.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

  <narrative>As co-chairmen of the CSIS Commission on Public Infrastructure, we strongly support the National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>Introduced by Senators Chris Dodd and Chuck Hagel, this bipartisan legislation will reverse decades of shortchanging our infrastructure and help restructure the federal role by allocating costs and financing more fairly and rationally. The legislation also will help ensure that infrastructure spending is unencumbered by political interference that neglects regional and national priorities. The Act will establish a policy structure for making infrastructure investments that meet  our country's critical needs.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Infrastructure Bank Act will stimulate new, long-term investments in infrastructure that will increase national productivity and improve our standard of living. The proposed Infrastructure Bank Act also will increase the ability of the private sector to play a central role in infrastructure provision and will report on the economic efficacy and transparency of all current federal financing methods. We urge that it be passed into law.</narrative>

  <narrative>Washington, DC, August 1, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR DODD, SENATOR HAGEL: I am writing on behalf of the more than 140,000 members of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) to applaud your joint sponsorship of the National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007. This legislation is a major step forward in providing meaningful financial assistance to the nation's failing infrastructure.</narrative>
  <narrative>As you know, ASCE concluded in our 2005 Report Card for America's Infrastructure that the nation's infrastructure deserved an overall grade of "D." We said then that America's aging and overburdened infrastructure threatens the economy and quality of life in every state, city, and town in the nation. In addition, we estimated that it will take an investment of $1.6 trillion over a five-year period to bring the nation's existing infrastructure into good working order. Little of significance  has changed in the two years since we issued that dismal grade, and establishing a long-term development and maintenance plan remains a pressing national priority.</narrative>
  <narrative>In creating the National Infrastructure Bank to evaluate and finance "capacity-building" infrastructure projects of substantial regional and national significance, the bill would prime the pump to begin meeting the staggering investment needs for our infrastructure. We believe the National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007 will begin the process of replacing and maintaining economically vital infrastructure systems across the nation. This nation cannot afford to wait much longer to invest significant  sums in its infrastructure, and your bill will lead the way.</narrative>
  <narrative>Please do not hesitate to contact Brian Pallasch, ASCE Director of Government Relations, or Michael Charles, Senior Manager of Government Relations, of our Washington office if we can be of any assistance in passing this important legislation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely yours,</narrative>

  <narrative>We want to go on record in support of your National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>We fully understand the need and responsibility we have to our nation and to our members to find a way to fund substantial regional and significant national infrastructure projects.</narrative>
  <narrative>We look forward to working with you and your colleagues in making the Dodd/Hagel National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007 a permanent part of the solution to funding our nation's most important infrastructure projects.</narrative>

  <narrative>Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator Hagel: Thank you for the opportunity to review your proposed National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007. Goldman Sachs shares your concern about our nation's aging infrastructure and its negative effects on our economy and our environment, and we strongly agree with you about the need to encourage additional infrastructure investment. We believe enactment of your legislation would help spur significant new investment in this area and thereby help address  this urgent national problem.</narrative>

  <narrative>ASSOCIATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington DC, August 1, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dear Senators Dodd and Hagel: On behalf of the more than 1,500 member organizations of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), I want to applaud your proposal to create a National Infrastructure Bank. As we look to the future, high-quality public transportation service must be available to more Americans and in more communities. Public transportation helps to reduce congestion and increases mobility. Transit also significantly reduces energy consumption, saving more than  1.4 billion gallons of gasoline every year. Americans are choosing to ride transit in record numbers, taking more than 10.1 billion trips in 2006. Unfortunately, only 54 percent of households have access to transit of any kind as they plan their daily travel.</narrative>
  <narrative>Much of the success of public transportation is due to federal investment in public transportation infrastructure, and the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank would extend valuable new federal resources to transit investment. The innovative financing and investment tools of a National Infrastructure Bank would aid the development and expansion of fixed guideway systems. These major projects require significant investments, but they are crucial to attracting new riders. Federal support  for new starts has helped to finance 127 new fixed guideway systems and system extensions which have gone into service since 1995. Looking ahead, such systems are more necessary than ever to address rapidly growing levels of congestion and to meet additional demands for travel. According to an APTA survey, new capital funds are needed for some 280 projects that will add 4,044 system miles of fixed guideway transit.</narrative>
  <narrative>If we expect our surface transportation infrastructure system to continue to provide a competitive edge for the United States, federal, state and local investment in public transportation is necessary, and new financing mechanisms like the National Infrastructure Bank must be investigated. APTA thanks you for your commitment to the further expansion of public transportation, and we look forward to working with you to advance your proposal.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely yours,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues in introducing the Equal Remedies Act of 2007 to repeal the caps on the amount of damages available in employment discrimination cases under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will end the glaring inequality in the current Federal antidiscrimination laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 gave women, religious minorities, and disabled workers the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for intentional employment discrimination, but only up to certain specified monetary limits. By contrast, victims of such discrimination on the basis of race or national origin can recover damages without such limitations, because they can bring their cases under  another statute. The Equal Remedies Act will remove this inequity by eliminating the caps on such damages under current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The caps were included in the 1991 act as part of a compromise that the first President Bush would sign. That legislation also reversed a series of Supreme Court decisions that had rolled back other basic civil rights protections and made it more difficult for working Americans to challenge discrimination. The 1991 Act as a whole represented a significant advance in the ongoing battle to eliminate discrimination in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, it's long past time to end the double standard that consigns women, religious minorities, and the disabled to second-class remedies under the civil rights laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The caps are especially unfair, because they deny adequate remedies to the most severely injured victims of discrimination. For example, a woman who needs extensive medical treatment as a result of severe sexual harassment, such as an assault, she will be limited to receiving only partial compensation for her injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of providing damages is to hold employers accountable and to make victims whole to the greatest extent possible for the discrimination they suffered. The current limit prevents accountability and keeps the victim from obtaining full relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The caps serve no justifiable purpose. They shield the worst employers from the full consequences of the most outrageous acts of discrimination. The deterrent purpose of damages fails when employers know that their liability is limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take, for example, Sharon Deters and her case against Equifax Credit Information Services. Sharon suffered constant sexual taunts and insults from her coworkers. Her supervisor praised her harassers' behavior and allowed it to continue. The jury in her case was so outraged by her employer's conduct that it awarded her $1 million in punitive damages, finding that such an award was necessary to get her employer's attention and make it change its ways. The caps on damages, however, reduced Sharon's  award to $300,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Results like that are not fair. They fail to fulfill the statutory purpose of such damages provision, which is to deter further violations. By passing the Equal Remedies Act of 2007, Congress will be affirming the basic principle of equal justice for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important change.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="Introducing S. 1929. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to conduct a feasibility study of water augmentation alternatives in the Sierra Vista Subwatershed; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1929">S. 1929</bill>] Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator McCain to introduce the Sierra Vista Sub-watershed Feasibility Study Act. This important piece of legislation is designed to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study alternatives to augment the water supplies in a critical area of southern Arizona in the Sierra Vista Sub-watershed, which is home to a congressionally protected riparian area known as the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area, SPRNCA, the U.S.  Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, and nearly 76,000 residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SPRNCA, which protects nearly 43 miles of the San Pedro River, serves as a principal passage for the migration of approximately 4 million birds. It also provides crucial habitat for 100 species of birds, 81 species of mammals, 43 species of reptiles and amphibians, and two threatened species of native fish. The Nature Conservancy has called the area one of the "last great places on earth."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort Huachuca, which is adjacent to SPRNCA, plays a critical role in this country's national security by, among other things, training soldiers in military intelligence. It also is the largest employer in the area, contributing greatly to the economy of Cochise County and the State of Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, the Fort has done an exemplary job of implementing water conservation and recharge measures as part of its responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act. Indeed, since 1995, it has reduced its groundwater pumping by more than 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, water levels in certain areas of the regional aquifer in the Sierra Vista Sub-watershed are still declining due to natural causes and development near Sierra Vista. Because SPRNCA and the fort could be negatively impacted by these declining water levels, a 2007 U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Appraisal level study concluded that augmenting the local water supply is necessary. To that end, Reclamation's study recommended several augmentation alternatives for further study, all of which  are supported by the Upper San Pedro Partnership, a congressionally recognized consortium of 21 local, state, and Federal agencies and private organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I am introducing today would authorize the Secretary to conduct a feasibility study of the alternatives recommended by Reclamation for further study. The legislation would also authorize appropriations for the Federal share of the study's costs. Importantly, the non-Federal cost share would be at least 55 percent, indicating the non-Federal parties' strong commitment to the study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The feasibility study authorized under this legislation is the next step in the process of determining how to best address the water challenges facing the Sierra Vista Sub-watershed. Consequently, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="Introducing S. 1930. A bill to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to prevent illegal logging practices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1930">S. 1930</bill>] Mr. President, about a year ago, a group of hardwood plywood  manufacturers came to me with a problem, Chinese hardwood plywood imports were threatening their businesses. They raised a whole host of issues, from tariff misclassification to subsidies to fraudulent labeling to illegal logging. These unfair and illegal practices were lowering the costs of the Chinese hardwood plywood imports, giving them an unfair advantage over U.S. hardwood  plywood and putting American companies in jeopardy of going out of business and the folks that they employ out of work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, I have been working to level the playing field for Oregon hardwood plywood manufacturers and protect the jobs of the workers that they employ. I have met with the Department of Commerce, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Customs and Border Patrol, and the International Trade Commission and urged them to investigate these issues and, where appropriate, act to address them. They have, raising these troubling practices in diplomatic negotiations, opening investigations,  and even filing a case before the World Trade Organization targeting Chinese subsidies that benefit the hardwood plywood industry, among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with the support of industry, labor, and the environmental community, I am proud to introduce the Combat Illegal Logging Act of 2007 to halt the trade in illegal timber and timber products. This act will help to level the playing field, not just for Oregon hardwood plywood manufacturers affected by Chinese imports, but for all American manufacturers across the country struggling to compete against imported, low-priced wood and wood products harvested from illegal sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally important, the act helps address an illegal logging crisis. From the Amazon to the Congo Basin, from Sulawesi to Siberia, illegal logging is destroying ecosystems. It is gutting local economies. It is annihilating ways of life. Because of the speed and violence with which illegal logging is occurring, failing to curb its effects now may result in irreversible damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that I am introducing today can help curb illegal logging and thwart its devastating consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lacey Act currently regulates trade in fish, wildlife, and a limited subset of plants by making it unlawful to "import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase" any that are taken, possessed, transported or sold in violation of any State law or, with respect to fish and wildlife only, any foreign law. The Combat Illegal Logging Act of 2007 would expand the Lacey Act so that violations of foreign law that apply to plants and plant products fall within its protections. It would  also specify the types of foreign law violations that trigger Lacey Act liability, laws intended to prevent theft or ensure the legal right to harvest the plants. Finally, the act would create a declaration requirement to facilitate the Lacey Act's enforcement for timber without placing an undue burden upon law-abiding businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The declaration requirements provide basic transparency for wood shipments. The declaration will have critical value for combating illegal logging by 1. encouraging importers to ask basic questions regarding the origin of their timber and timber products; 2. providing information at the point of import that will allow authorities with limited resources to do efficient, targeted inspections and enforcement; and 3. helping enforcement agents to immediately identify "low-hanging fruit," such as  timber expressly prohibited to be exported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act will definitely change the way that folks who are importing illegally harvested timber and wood products do business, this is its intended purpose. But for the many companies who already play by the rules, the act's requirements should result in minimal changes to the way they operate. Moreover, when the act's impact from a competitiveness standpoint is factored in, the effect is a net positive for these companies. This act changes the incentives to reward due diligence, a sound long-term  business strategy from any perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work by stakeholders that many might view as strange bedfellows. The principal negotiators of the compromise, the American Forest &amp; Paper Association, the Hardwood Federation, and the Environmental Investigation Agency, deserve a tremendous amount of credit for sticking with this and finding a solution that everyone could support. I applaud them for their hard work, the maturity with which they approached the issue, and the respect that they  showed each other throughout the process. Their conduct is a model for how things should work in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to applaud the work of several of my colleagues in the House, Congressman Blumenauer, Congressman Wexler, and Congressman Weller, who introduced their own illegal logging bill, the Legal Timber Protection Act, earlier this year. I understand that their bill may be taken up by the House Natural Resources Committee this fall and I am hopeful that they will substitute the broadly supported text of the Combat Illegal Logging Act for their bill, paving  the way for the enactment of this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Senator Alexander, Senator Kerry, Senator Snowe, and Senator Feingold for agreeing to be original cosponsors of the bill. I would also like to thank the following organizations, in addition to the American Forest &amp; Paper Association, the Hardwood Federation, and the Environmental Investigation Agency for endorsing the bill: Center for International Environmental Law, Conservation International, Defenders of Wildlife, Dogwood Alliance,  ForestEthics, Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, Greenpeace, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, National Hardwood Lumber Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, Rainforest Action Network, Rainforest Alliance, Sierra Club, Society of American Foresters, Sustainable Furniture Council, The Nature Conservancy, Tropical Forest Trust, United Steelworkers, Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wildlife Fund.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="Introducing S. 1931. A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to ensure that development of certain Federal oil and gas resources will occur in a manner that protects water resources and respects the rights of surface owners, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1931">S. 1931</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Surface Owner Protection Act to help protect private property on split estates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Western U.S. is experiencing a boom in oil and gas exploration that will contribute to the domestic supply of energy in this country, improve our National security and help control energy costs for American consumers. But if it is not done right oil and gas leasing can be damaging to wildlife, pollute our water, and scar the land. Furthermore, in many areas of the West the land is in split estates where mineral rights are owned by the Federal Government, but the surface is owned by a private  land owner. Oftentimes the process of oil and gas leasing and drilling does not adequately involve surface owners or protect their agricultural livelihoods that are disrupted during energy development. Split estates cover 58 million acres in the U.S., and 11.7 million acres in Montana alone. That is just slightly smaller than the size of New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In states like Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado there has been a rapid increase in the number of leases and the amount of acreage that the Bureau of Land Management is approving for oil and gas exploration. It is expected that coal-bed methane development will bring tens of thousands of wells in coming decades. The rapid growth is causing general unease in some areas because surface owners have few rights when it comes to oil and gas exploration on their land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often surface owners have no idea that their minerals are owned by someone else or when they are going to be leased. The legislation I am introducing today is meant to better involve surface owners in the process of oil and gas exploration by requiring notification to surface owners when their land is going to be leased, require operators to replace any water that disrupts other users, and requires bonding for the reclamation of surface land. Surface owners should have a clear role in each  step of the process from the day a lease sale is announced to the time when the rigs are gone and reclamation work is completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Critics of this measure will argue that it gets in the way of drilling. I would say that oil and gas drilling should not get in the way of farmers and ranchers going about their business without clear legal guidelines. The protection of private property rights is crucially important as a personal freedom in the U.S. and we must take steps to protect them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage members of this body to support this measure as we move forward because I believe that we can improve the way we conduct oil and gas leases on split estates. A better balance between oil and gas interests and surface owners is possible, but we need to make sure that we develop our energy resources in an appropriate manner with respect to private property owners.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="Introducing S. 1933. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to provide grants to small public drinking water systems; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1933">S. 1933</bill>] Mr. President, small rural water systems are facing compliance deadlines, and need assistance without burdensome matching funding requirements. The Small Community Drinking Water Funding Act that I am introducing today with Senators ENSIGN, BOXER, MURRAY, CLINTON, BAUCUS, SANDERS, and CONRAD, amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a Small Public Water System  Assistance Program. This program is to support small water systems in complying with national primary drinking water regulations, and includes a program for Indian tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The smallest public water systems, which serve fewer than 3,300 people, represent 85 percent of all public water systems. Small public water systems serving fewer than 10,000 people represent 94 percent of all public water systems. Small communities throughout Nevada would benefit from a grant program designed to provide funding for water quality projects without a difficult matching requirement; and Federal programs in effect as of the date of enactment of this act do not adequately meet the  needs of small communities in Nevada with respect to public water systems. The Small Community Drinking Water Funding Act will authorize $750,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2014. Nevada should be able to secure a substantial portion of this funding because of the State's rural water systems needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of this bill is to establish a program to provide grants to small public water systems to meet applicable national primary drinking water regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Second, maintain water costs at a reasonable level for the communities served by small public water systems. Third, obtain technical assistance to develop the capacity to sustain operations over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is intended to ensure that our Nation's small, disadvantaged communities have access to the financial help they need to provide safe, reliable, and affordable drinking water with the authorization of $750 million annually for 7 years starting next year. The Small Community Safe Drinking Water Act provides substantial flexibility to States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevada's small communities are facing a drinking water infrastructure crisis. These communities, and other small communities nationwide, confront increasing demand for clean, reliable, and affordable drinking water. But it is simply too costly for small communities, alone, to address this water infrastructure crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They need a financial helping hand from the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
