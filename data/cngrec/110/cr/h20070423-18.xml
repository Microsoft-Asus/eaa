    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="s" number="521">S. 521</bill> is a bill to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 515 West First Street in Duluth, Minnesota, as Judge Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building and United States Courthouse and Customhouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Heaney was appointed judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on November 3, 1966. He took senior status on December 31, 1988, and retired on August 31, 2006, after over 40 years of distinguished service to his country and the citizens of Minnesota. I rise in strong support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Heaney was born on January 29, 1918, in Goodhue, a rural community in the southeastern part of Minnesota. As a child growing up in a farming community, Judge Heaney learned the value of a close family, honesty, and hard work. These qualities have marked not only his personal life but also his life as a public servant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was educated at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul and received his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Heaney is a decorated World War II veteran and was a member of the distinguished Army Ranger Battalion and participated in the historic D-Day landing at Normandy. He was awarded the Silver Star for extraordinary bravery in the Battle of La Pointe du Hoc in Normandy. He also received a Bronze Star and five battle stars. At the end of the war, Judge Heaney returned home and entered private practice in Duluth. During this time, he was instrumental in improving the State's education system,  and served on the board of regents for the University of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was instrumental in helping develop for the Duluth school system the same pay scale for both men and women. In 1966, he was appointed by President Johnson to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. In that capacity, he has been a champion in protecting the rights of the disadvantaged. He was devoted to making sure that every person had an equal opportunity for an education, a job, and a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He firmly believes the poor and the less educated and the less advantaged deserve the protection of the Constitution. As a hardworking, well-prepared and fair-minded jurist, he left his legal stamp on school desegregation cases, bankruptcy laws, prison treatment, and Social Security law. His public service is marked by industry, brilliance, and scholarly excellence. His compassion and dedication to those most disadvantaged is unparalleled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Heaney is most deserving of this honor. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="s" number="521">S. 521</bill> is a companion bill to <bill type="h" number="187">H.R. 187</bill> which was introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). This bill designates the Federal building and United States courthouse and customhouse at 515 West First Street in Duluth, Minnesota, as the Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building and United States Courthouse and Customhouse. The bill honors Judge Heaney's dedication to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have heard previously, after serving in the Army during World War II and acquiring a law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School, Judge Gerald Heaney entered into the private practice of law from 1946 to 1966. Judge Heaney's career as a judge began in 1966 with an appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit by President Lyndon Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Heaney had a reputation for championing equal justice for underprivileged and vulnerable citizens. He retired after 40 years of service on August 31, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
