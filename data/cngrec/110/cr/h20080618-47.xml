  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1270">H. Res. 1270</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas following the conduct of presidential and parliamentary elections on March 29, 2008, Zimbabwe's liberator-turned-despot, Robert Mugabe, unleashed a campaign of terror and intimidation against opposition members, supporters, and other civilians in a desperate attempt to cling to power;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas human rights groups have documented numerous incidents of state-sponsored political violence in Zimbabwe in recent years, and substantial political violence and human rights violations committed by government agents accompanied parliamentary elections in 2000 and 2005, and the presidential election in 2002;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas reports from the region indicate that the Mugabe regime intends to continue this well-established pattern of state-sponsored and targeted violence and intimidation in the run-up to a second round of voting on June 27, 2008;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Department of State found in its 2007 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices that the Mugabe regime "engaged in the pervasive and systematic abuse of human rights, which increased significantly" in 2007, and reported that "state-sanctioned use of excessive force increased, and security forces tortured members of the opposition, student leaders, and civil society activists";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum documented 586 incidents of torture, 855 incidents of assault, and 19 incidents of politically-motivated abductions and kidnappings in 2007 alone;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Freedom House declared the Mugabe regime to be one of "the world's most repressive";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Human Rights Watch reported on April 19, 2008, that the Mugabe regime had established a network of informal detention centers to beat, torture, and intimidate political opponents and other civilians;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas following the March 29 elections in Zimbabwe, a Chinese vessel, the An Yue Jiang, arrived in South Africa carrying a shipment of weapons for the Zimbabwean Defense Force that reportedly included 3,000,000 rounds of AK-47 ammunition, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades, and 3,000 mortar bombs and tubes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the delivery of such arms would only further degrade the security situation in Zimbabwe, which has already been compromised, as the materiel are likely to be used by government security forces and militias to further abuse, torture, and kill members of the political opposition and other civilians;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the dock and freight workers of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union refused to unload the shipment or transport its cargo;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) called for an international boycott of the vessel, stating, "There's no prospect of there being a sudden external invasion of Zimbabwe. And so it is very difficult for anyone to conclude that this ammunition is likely to be used for anything other than to take action against opposition groups";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Congress of Southern African Trade Unions joined in the call by the ITF and others for an international boycott of the vessel;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the High Court of the South African port city of Durban blocked the reported weapons transfer and ordered South African authorities to prevent the vessel's passage through South African waters;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas press reports suggest that other governments in the region, including those of Mozambique and Tanzania also denied the vessel permission to dock at their ports;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Zambian President and Southern African Development Community (SADC) Chairman Levy Mwanawasa commended South Africa and Mozambique for blocking the arms shipment, stating, "I hope this will be the case with all the countries because we do not want a situation which will escalate the situation in Zimbabwe more than what it is";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas despite the SADC chairman's appeal to member nations to block the delivery of ammunition of Zimbabwe and China's alleged recall of the An Yue Jiang, Zimbabwe's Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga announced the shipment had arrived in Harare on or around May 16, 2008;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas while Beijing has denied that the shipment reached its destination, speculation on the possible surreptitious delivery of weapons to Harare continues;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States has been vocal in its condemnation of the atrocities and violence in Zimbabwe, and has implemented targeted financial and travel sanctions against select members of the Mugabe regime and others who "have engaged in actions or policies to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions";</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas in violation of the Vienna Convention, American diplomats and officials from other embassies in Harare have been repeatedly harassed by elements of the Mugabe regime in retaliation for their repeated protests against the ongoing state-sponsored campaign of terror ahead of the June 27 presidential runoff election, including the detention of the American ambassador's vehicle for several hours on May 13, 2008, and the detention of 5 American embassy staff and 2 local embassy workers on June  5, 2008; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congress expressed its opposition to the Mugabe regime's undemocratic policies in the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, and other subsequent legislation: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes and commends the efforts of southern African trade unions, religious leaders, and advocacy groups to raise awareness about the possible weapons transfer to Zimbabwe as part of a campaign to address the worsening political, economic, and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes and commends the efforts of those southern African governments which denied access through their national territories for a weapons shipment destined to be received by a regime that continues to perpetuate gross human rights violations against its own citizens;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) urges the United States to continue to work with African governments and multilateral institutions to compel Robert Mugabe's regime to respect the will of its citizens and find a peaceful and timely solution to the current political standoff; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) urges the Permanent Representative of the United States at the United Nations to advocate for an international moratorium on all shipments of arms, weapons, and related goods and services to Zimbabwe until the current political crisis has been resolved and democracy, human rights, and the rule of law are respected by the Government of Zimbabwe.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me begin by thanking the ranking member of the full committee, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, for introducing this very important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the March 29, 2008 presidential and parliamentarian elections in Zimbabwe and the 5-week delay in announcing the presidential victory, President Robert Mugabe of ZANU-PF has carried out a reign of terror on opposition supporters, opposition leaders, and civil society. Mr. Mugabe's effort to coerce and intimidate the people of Zimbabwe before the June 27 runoff have included the torture and beating of over 900 people and the loss of dozens of lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support <bill type="hr" number="1270">H. Res. 1270</bill>, commending the efforts of the southern African governments who sought to block an international arms transfer destined for Zimbabwe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution specifically, one, recognizes and commends the efforts of southern African trade unions, religious leaders and advocacy groups to raise awareness about the possibility of weapons transfers to Zimbabwe as part of the campaign to address the worsening political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe; recognizes and commends the effort of those southern African governments which denied access through their national territories for a weapons shipment destined to be received  by a regime that continues to perpetuate gross human rights violations against its own citizens; urges the United States to continue to work with African governments and multilateral institutions to compel Mr. Robert Mugabe's regime to respect the will of its citizens and find a peaceful and timely solution to the current political standoff; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The successful transportation of arms into Zimbabwe may have increased the political violence that already exists. It is critically important that the international community work together with regional leaders at the Africa Union and sub-regional organizations to foster a peaceful resolution towards the human rights violations facing the Zimbabwean people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Nonproliferation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, of which I am an original cosponsor. I worked on this draft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as we previously discussed during the debate of Mr. Payne's previous resolution, Zimbabwe is in very grim shape. We had a flawed election there in March, and Robert Mugabe launched a campaign of terror on his population as a consequence of that election going against him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Madam Speaker, this string of violence really could have turned into a blood bath were it not for the South African dock workers who stood up to say "No." While post-election tensions there were very high, a Chinese ship pulled into the South African port of Durban to unload its cargo that was destined for Zimbabwe. On board were 3 million rounds of assault rifle ammunition, 3,000 mortar rounds, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades. Left to the South African Government, whose President, Mbeki,  has worked to protect Mugabe, the shipment would have no doubt been delivered. But fortunately the citizens of South Africa are ahead of their government in realizing the odious nature of the Zimbabwe regime and the members of that dock workers union stood upon and said "No." A newspaper published the details of the shipment. The dock workers refused to unload</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Africans stood up for fellow Africans; an inspiring event, indeed. And frankly, it reminded me in the early 1970s of when we saw a labor leader at a Polish port who stood up, and his name was Lech Walesa. And he faced off against Soviet tyranny and he demanded democracy and freedom for Poland. There were echoes of Lech Walesa in the South African port workers as they said they were not going to play a role in Mugabe's brutality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the "ship of shame" also highlights the destructive role of China on the African continent, which has played the role of enabler in other African violence there. During the incident, a Chinese spokesman described the shipment as "normal trade in military products," which speaks volumes about Beijing's policy of supplying weapons to regimes like Zimbabwe and Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China provided machetes to the Rwandan Government to carry out its 1994 genocide. It does this for political influence and for economic gain. And China is currently Zimbabwe's largest investor and second largest trading partner, where it secures much-needed natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China will, for the foreseeable future, continue to turn a blind eye to the conflicts that it helps ignite, all the while sticking to its so-called "principle" of "noninterference." Clearly, this includes genocide and potential mass violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this resolution is about Africans. We should give credit, as this resolution does, to those countries that have taken a strong stand, refusing to become complicit, no matter how small a role, in the fomentation of violence. And that is what these dock workers and others in civil society in Africa stood up and did. And I urge passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I, too, rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1270">H. Res. 1270</bill> and want to commend our ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for authoring this and helping to bring it to the floor. And I thank the majority for its support, including Chairman Payne, of this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution addresses the courage of those brave souls who took a stand for peace and democracy as they sought to block an arms shipment that was headed for Zimbabwe. I also strongly support this resolution's call for an arms embargo against the Mugabe regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these dark days in Zimbabwe, it is encouraging that we recognize something positive, the efforts of those who have tried to stop the violence, the intimidation, and the bloodshed that have become the hallmark of the Mugabe regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret to the people of Zimbabwe or to those in the region that this regime has become the poster child for human rights abuses, but in order to bring about change in Zimbabwe those in the region and the wider international community have to take a real stand. That is what dock and freight workers did in the port city of Durban, South Africa, when a Chinese ship reportedly carrying millions of rounds of AK-47 ammunition, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades, and thousands of other bombs for  the Zimbabwean Defense Force came into port in early April. The dock and freight workers, as my colleagues have already told us, of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union refused to offload the weapons--another reason why I like labor unions. They refused to get the blood</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I ask my colleagues to support a move to go a step further and support an international arms embargo against Zimbabwe for as long as Mugabe and his cronies are undermining democracy and using violence in that country. The more weapons that enter Zimbabwe, the more likely that Mugabe's forces will use them against their opponents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1270">H. Res. 1270</bill> will send a message to the international community and to Mugabe himself that civilized nations will not sit by and allow him to run roughshod over his own people. It remains to be seen if China will see fit to  place principle over profit and ensure that its weapons stay out of Mugabe's hands. Its track record not just in Zimbabwe, but also in Sudan, has not been a good one, and so, frankly, I would not be that optimistic about China's performance  in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me conclude by once again thanking the sponsor of this very important resolution. I think it's been said very clearly that when people stand up, we can defeat tyranny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I compliment the dock workers who refused to unload the ship. As has been mentioned, the solidarity movement in Poland led to democracy there. And actually, back in the sixties, there was an incident during the height of the Cold War where the dock workers of Newark refused to unload a ship of furs from the Soviet Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>At that time, Krushchev said they were going to bury the U.S., and the ILA and the dock workers refused to unload that ship, once again showing solidarity. As a person who worked on the docks of Newark for 4 years during my early career, I certainly appreciate the strength of the dock workers and the labor unions and ILA from around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have to work on proliferation of conventional weapons that we see throughout the world. I think we have to really monitor and rein in the People's Republic of China that continues to support the brutal regime in Sudan with the atrocities in Darfur. We have to say that if we are going to be a country living in the community of world nations, then there is a responsibility to act responsibly in this new millennium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so with that, I urge the passage of House Resolution 1270.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="1270">H. Res. 1270</bill>, which commends the efforts of those who sought to block an international arms transfer destined for Zimbabwe, and calls for an arms embargo against the Mugabe regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a time when Robert Mugabe spoke persuasively about an independent Zimbabwe governed by majority rule and inspired millions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when Zimbabwe finally won its independence, Mugabe was hailed as a liberator and a hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at some point over the past 28 years, the vision of a peaceful, democratic Zimbabwe became distant and grossly distorted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As early as 1982, Mugabe unleashed his infamous North Korean-trained 5th Brigade to crush an uprising in the Matabeleland and Midlands provinces, and slaughtered an estimated 20,000 of his ethnic rivals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later in 2005, the regime launched "Operation Clear out the Trash," destroying nearly 100,000 housing structures and depriving an estimated 700,000 people of their homes, livelihoods, or both during Zimbabwe's harsh winter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mugabe regime has become a brutal kleptocracy, content to rule by the barrel of the gun, while the people of Zimbabwe struggle to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, he has had a lot of practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zimbabwe's disputed elections of 2000, 2002, and 2005, were all marred by substantial levels of state-sponsored violence, political repression, voter intimidation, vote-rigging and other forms of manipulation by the ruling ZANU-PF party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That pattern not only continued, but also accelerated in the run-up to the elections of March 29th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the State Department's 2007 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the Mugabe regime, "engaged in the pervasive and systematic abuse of human rights, which increased significantly [in 2007] ..... state-sanctioned use of excessive force increased ..... and security forces tortured members of the opposition, student leaders, and civil society activists."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum documented 586 incidents of torture, 855 incidents of assault, and 19 incidents of politically-motivated abductions and kidnappings in 2007 alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 19, 2008, Human Rights Watch reported that the Mugabe regime had established a network of informal detention centers to beat, torture, and intimidate political opponents and other civilians,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days following the March 29th elections, reports of violent political repression, illegal farm invasions, and, other gross violations of human rights by security forces and ruling party supporters increased at alarming rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a report issued earlier this month, Human Rights Watch details the systematic campaign of terror unleashed by the regime "in an effort to destroy the opposition and ensure that Mugabe wins the presidential runoff elections on June 27, 2008."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one incident, the report quotes soldiers threatening a group of villagers by saying, "If you vote for MDC in the presidential runoff election, you have seen the bullets, we have enough for each one of you, so beware."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when a Chinese ship arrived at the port city of Durban, South Africa, reportedly carrying 3 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades, and 3,000 mortar bombs and tubes for the Zimbabwean Defense Force in early April, observers were understandably concerned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But before the international community even knew about the potential arms transfer, the dock and freight workers of the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union had taken matters into their own hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Determined not to contribute to the brutal suppression of opposition voices in Zimbabwe, the dock and freight workers courageously refused to offload or transport the weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Transport Workers' Federation, the Congress of Southern African Trade Unions (COSATU), religious leaders and other advocates quickly expressed their solidarity with the workers and launched a campaign calling for an international boycott of the vessel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before long, the governments of South Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania reportedly were compelled to deny the ship permission to dock at their ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zambian President and Southern African Development Community (SADC) Chairman Levy Mwanawasa publically praised their actions and appealed to all 14 SADC member nations to block the shipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The heroic efforts of the dock and freight workers, southern African trade unions, religious leaders, advocacy groups and southern African Governments to block the arms shipment deserve recognition and praise of the highest order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through their valor and steadfastness, these courageous individuals may ultimately save countless lives from Mugabe's reign of terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is now incumbent upon all responsible nations to stand in solidarity with the governments and people of southern Africa, and to deny this murderous regime the means to continue oppressing its people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="1270">H. Res. 1270</bill>, which commends those who boldly acted to block a shipment of weapons from China to Zimbabwe, and calls for an international moratorium on any future transfers until the current political crisis has been resolved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly call upon my colleagues who support strengthened ties between the United States and China to convey to their friends in Beijing that their continued engagement with the Mugabe regime can provide no tangible benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing the shipment of weapons to Zimbabwe at this time only makes them complicit in the campaign of terror and intimidation that has been unleashed upon the Zimbabwean people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If China wishes to mend its tarnished image, denying weapons sales to known perpetrators of human rights violations might be a good place to start.</paragraph>
