  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am here today to announce our support of the A-PLUS Act authored by my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra). I stand here as the founder and chairman of the Congressional Constitution Caucus, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Normally, when I begin my weekly floor speeches, I quote the relevant portion of the Constitution that corresponds with the evening's topic. Yet today I have difficulty choosing a coinciding article and section from our founding document. You see, the Constitution does not contain the word "school" or even "education." Contrary to common modern misconceptions, there is no constitutional right guaranteeing each citizen an education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this does not mean education is unimportant or that the Constitution is silent on the issue. The 10th amendment unambiguously states, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically, in the United States, education has not fallen under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. Parents, local schools and the States were responsible for children's academic training. It has only been in the last 50 years or so has the Federal Government begun overstepping its constitutional boundaries by parading the increasing bureaucracies of the Department of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hoekstra's bill seeks to correct many of the problems associated with a Federal bureaucracy by putting control over education money back into the hands of the taxpayers and, most importantly, the parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current system, the Federal Government essentially bribes States into complying with the burdensome No Child Left Behind program. Yes, States can opt out of these regulations, but doing so would mean losing millions of dollars in aid every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under its bill, first it will free States from following needless Federal regulations and mandates. Currently, the No Child Left Behind program restricts academic innovation and ignores the diversity present in each State, region and school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, A-PLUS Act will reduce the amount of time and money that school officials currently devote to complying with these mandates. Each  hour and dollar spent in administering No Child Left Behind could be funneled instead into improving our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirdly, A-PLUS Act will ensure that parents, schools and the States are held accountable for the education process. Rather than allowing oversight to rest in some far-flung bureaucracies here in Washington, it will be right at home here in your local school district. But most importantly, giving States the freedom to keep their education dollars in oversight within their own State is exactly what our Founding Fathers originally intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Madison, often considered the father of the Constitution, will be remembered this coming Friday, March 16, on the 250th anniversary of his birth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a way, Madison predicted this situation we now find ourselves in, when he wrote, "In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for us to explain why we are not controlling ourselves. Our Founding Fathers deliberately wrote a Constitution of enumerated specific powers. While some countries have attempted to limit government by writing Constitutions that specify every single thing and every single line, our government Constitution does not do that. Therefore, in Article I, Section 8, the founders specifically listed congressional powers, and in the 10th amendment grants that all other legislative powers are  in the hands of States or the people respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in essence, it makes sense that Congress should perform duties only prescribed by the Constitution. When you think about it, the United States has thrived as a nation precisely because the freedom of the people has been protected by a limited government. The Constitution is the anchor that protects American citizens from the storms of a controlling central government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Madison wrote also in The Federalist No. 45, "The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government are few and defined." He would add, probably, that education is not one of them. So Mr. Hoekstra's common-sense legislation follows Madison's insights by ensuring that the States have the opportunity to retain control over their own education dollars. Doing so will not only improve the quality of the education system, but will help return our Nation to the  principles of limited government, federalism, and the 10th amendment.</paragraph>
