    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Federal regulation process is one of the most important ways by which our Nation implements public policy. Each year, agencies issue thousands of regulations to promote safety in our lives, from the food we eat, to the cars we drive, to the air we breathe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although regulations play a critical role in protecting so many aspects of our daily lives, there is no independent, nonpartisan entity that Congress can rely upon to help us ensure that these regulations are working as intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administrative Conference of the United States was just such an entity, a public-private think tank that provided invaluable guidance to Congress about how to improve the administrative and regulatory process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First authorized by President John F. Kennedy, the Conference made numerous recommendations over the course of its 27-year existence, many of which were enacted into law. The conference was last funded into in 1995. <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill>, the Regulatory Improvement Act of 2007, would reauthorize it for 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some might ask why we are reauthorizing an entity that has been out of existence for so long. Let me mention three important reasons. First, the Conference can save taxpayer dollars, in fact, millions of dollars. When it was in existence, it helped agencies implement many cost-saving procedures and make numerous recommendations to eliminate excessive litigation costs and long delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just one agency alone, the Social Security Administration, estimated that the Conference's recommendation to change that agency's appeal process yielded approximately $85 million in savings. Indeed, Justice Stephen Breyer testified before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law about the "huge" savings to the public resulting from the Conference's recommendations. Justice Antonin Scalia likewise agreed that it was an enormous bargain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the Administrative Conference promoted innovation among agencies. For example, it convinced 24 agencies to use alternative dispute resolution for issues concerning the private sector. The Conference also spearheaded implementation of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, governing consumer product warranties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Conference played a major role in encouraging agencies to promulgate smarter regulations. It did this by working to improve the public's understanding and participation in the rulemaking process, promoting judicial review of agency regulations, and reducing regulatory burdens on the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, and perhaps most importantly, Congress needs the conference. Experience with the Congressional Review Act proves that there are limitations in Congress' ability to provide aggressive oversight of the regulatory process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressional recognition of the Conference's significant contributions to the regulatory process is probably best evidenced by the fact that legislation assigning responsibilities to it continues to be introduced in nearly every Congress, including the current one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Research Service advises that reactivation of the Conference now would come at "an opportune time," especially in light of efforts by the White House to augment its involvement in the regulatory process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few entities that have enjoyed more bipartisan support than the Administrative Conference, and understandably so. It is all about promoting good government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleague, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, Chris Cannon of Utah, for his leadership in continuing to pursue reauthorization of the conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last October, the House passed this bill on suspension by voice vote without amendment. The Senate late last month finally acted and passed the bill with a small amendment which essentially reauthorizes the Conference at a level of funding in the amount of $3.2 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to concur in the Senate amendment so we can send this bill to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from California for his work on this bill, and thank the chairman of the committee and also the ranking members of the subcommittee and committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted to see us conclude today our consideration of <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill> which would reauthorize the Administrative Conference of the United States. The bill we consider today was amended slightly by the Senate which required this action by us today. But I strongly urge the House to concur in the Senate's amendment today. I also urge the Appropriations Committee and the House to appropriate funds promptly to ACUS. We need this exemplary agency once again to become a living, breathing entity and  reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why is that? As the distinguished Member from Utah (Mr. Cannon) remarked when we originally voted out the bill, and quoting from prior adage,  "The government that governs best, governs least. And when the government does govern, it should govern at its best." He is exactly right. That is the role of ACUS, to ensure that when the government acts, it acts at its best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The small appropriations that we historically invested in ACUS yielded us major overall savings in time and in money. ACUS consistently pinpointed ways for the government to reduce the cost it incurs and that it imposes. As we confront the specter of exploding Social Security and Medicare entitlement costs hijacking the Federal budget, we need ACUS all the more. We must do everything we can to avoid waste in our spending and to lighten the government burden on our economy. By reauthorizing and  refunding ACUS, we can take important steps in that effort. I again thank the gentleman from California for his work.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400361" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas and I thank the Speaker as well as the work of Mr. Cannon of Utah. I urge passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have seen most recently in the actions and inactions by the FDA dealing with the salmonella incidents, or whether it is the Consumer Product Safety Commission and some of the issues involving manufactured products from other countries, the regulatory process is extraordinarily important in protecting the American people. Congress is doing its best to oversee these agencies, but we can use the assistance of this important conference, and I join my colleague in urging passage of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill>, Regulatory Improvement Act of 2007. The administrative conference was first created inside the Department of Justice by President Kennedy. Later, it was moved out of the Department of Justice by President Johnson. The mission was a private partnership to discuss administrative law and regulatory system and how to make it better. Supreme Court Justices Breyer and Scalia served on the Conference before becoming  Justices and both have testified in the past for its re-authorization. This bill reauthorizes the Administrative Conference. I support this bill and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), an independent agency and advisory committee created in 1968, studied U.S. administrative processes with an eye to recommending improvements to Congress and agencies. From 1968 to 1995, the ACUS issued approximately 200 recommendations, most of which have been at least partially implemented. Congressional funding for ACUS was terminated in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ACUS's recommendations were published periodically in the Code of Federal Regulations prior to 1995. Little known "outside the Beltway," ACUS was a unique entity. Comprised of between 75 and 101 individuals drawn from agencies, academia, and the private sector, the Conference was classified as both an independent agency and a federal advisory committee. Organizationally, it consisted of a Chair, a Council, and an Assembly. The Chair, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for  a five-year term, was responsible for the day-to-day activities and supervision of the 18 permanent staff. The Council, which functioned like a board of directors, consisted of ten members appointed by the President for three-year terms, five of whom were always</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary, although not exclusive, function of the Conference was to study administrative processes with an eye to recommending improvements to Congress and the agencies. It performed this function by commissioning studies by law professors expert in the administrative process that then were reviewed by one of six standing committees: adjudication, administration, governmental processes, judicial review, regulation, and rulemaking. The recommendations developed by committees of the Conference  would be considered for adoption by the Assembly in plenary sessions, which were typically held twice a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The improvements occasioned by the Conferences recommendations are legion. Inasmuch as the Conference never had the power to impose its recommendations on unwilling subjects, the fact that so many of its recommendations bore fruit is a testimony to their intrinsic sense. Some, like the Conference's recommendation in 1968, its first year of operation, to eliminate a jurisdictional amount in suits under the APA, were followed by Congress in passing new legislation. Another example is its recommendation  to provide administrative penalty authority to agencies to increase the effectiveness of agency enforcement activities at lower cost, first proposed by the Conference in 1972 and since adopted by Congress in over 200 statutes. A third is its 1980 recommended solution to unseemly races to the courthouse in rulemaking appeals, adopted by Congress in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other recommendations, like the Conference's early recommendation to eliminate the exemption from the APA's notice-and-comment requirements for rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, and contracts, were sufficiently influential to lead agencies to adopt the recommendations on their own. Its recommendation in 1988 on Presidential Transition Workers' Code of Ethical Conduct were used by President Bush as the basis for his transition standards of conduct, and the Clinton administration  likewise followed what had become standard procedures. From 1968 to 1995, the Conference issued approximately 200 recommendations, most of which have been at least partially implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Probably the area in which the Conference had its greatest influence was in introducing and supporting the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques in agency practice. Its recommendation in 1982 provided procedures by which agencies could negotiate proposed regulations, and it followed the recommendation with support and encouragement to agencies to experiment with this new technique. Ultimately, Congress adopted the Negotiated Rulemaking Act in 1990, virtually copying the procedures  contained in the Conference's original recommendation. Similarly, in 1986 the Conference issued the first of some fifteen recommendations on using alternative means of dispute resolution in agency adjudications. In 1990 Congress again followed the Conference's lead and enacted the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. Recognizing the Conference's leadership role in this area, that Act gave the Conference the principal role for coordinating and promoting ADR in the federal government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another area in which the Conference had a major influence involved its study of Presidential review of agency rulemaking undertaken during the Reagan administration. This was a subject that had the potential to become highly partisan, but the Conference's reputation for neutrality and expertise enabled it to review the practice, generally validate its exercise, and makes certain recommendations to improve its openness and public acceptability. Because of the Conference's track record of useful  and expert studies of the administrative process, all the regulatory reform bills considered by the Senate in the last session included provisions for the Conference to study the effects of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Conference's contribution to administrative law and procedure was not limited just to studies. Drawing on its expertise, ACUS issued numerous publications designed to assist agencies in their administrative processes. For example, in 1972 the Conference published the first edition of its Manual for Administrative Law Judges (now in its 3d edition); in 1978 it published its Interpretive Guide to the Government in the Sunshine Act; in 1981 it issued Model Rules for Agency Implementation of  the Equal Access to Justice Act. The latter two of these documents were responsive to Congress' requirement for agencies to consult with the Conference in implementing these statutes. In addition, the Conference has published sourcebooks on Federal Administrative Procedure, Negotiated Rulemaking, and Alternative Dispute Resolution, as well as the Guide to Federal Agency Rulemaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in recent years, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Congress authorized the Conference to lend its expertise to newly emerging democracies in their creation of administrative law and procedures. As a result, the Conference sponsored seminars in the Ukraine, Hungary, the People's Republic of China, and South Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ABA has long been a strong supporter of the Conference, and over the years the Conference and the Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice have enjoyed a close and mutually supportive relationship. This bill reauthorizes the administrative conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this Act and encourage my colleagues to support it also.</paragraph>
