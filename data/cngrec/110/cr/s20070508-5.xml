    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an hour, with the time equally divided. The majority will control the first half and the Republicans will have the final 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate then will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill>, the FDA bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the information of the Members, there is a filing deadline at 10:30 this morning for second-degree amendments to the substitute amendment and the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 11:50 this morning, we will change course and proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Frederick Kampala, to be a U.S. district judge in northern Illinois. There will be 20 minutes of debate and then a vote. Following the vote, the Senate will recess for our regular conference meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, cloture was invoked on the committee substitute. I hope that at some point we will be in a position to agree to the amendments by unanimous consent or to get cloture for completing action on the FDA bill. There are still a number of amendments pending, and a preliminary review by all the Parliamentarians indicates some of them are arguably germane postcloture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say on this matter, I informed the Republican leader yesterday we would not have any votes after 4 o'clock today, but that doesn't mean we would not be in session. If we can't get some agreement on running out the 30 hours, we will have to be in session until that time expires, around 10 or 11 o'clock tonight. Then we would in the morning come in and finish this FDA bill. Then it is my understanding--the Parliamentarian can correct me if I am wrong--that there would be a cloture vote  on WRDA at that time, unless some agreement is worked out on that, to move to that bill.</paragraph>
