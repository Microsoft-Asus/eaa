    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to thank Rev. Paul Rowold, pastor of Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Polson, MT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prophet Isaiah wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lord has given me the tongue of a teacher, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Pastor Paul, for being here to sustain us today and opening our Senate in prayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Paul served Lutheran congregations in several other places in the country--Rockford, IL, and Englewood, CO--prior to his call to Polson, MT, in 1977.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Polson--for those of you who don't know, and I am sure more of you do--is a small community on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. It sits at the south end of Flathead Lake, one of the largest natural freshwater--actually, to be precise, we have to get our adjectives lined up here--Flathead is the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi and, I might say, near some of the most pristine wilderness on the planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Paul is an expert on the Holy Land, and he has traveled there more than 20 times, both as an archaeologist and as a tour guide. We were just earlier talking about his experience as a tour guide and just how wonderfully warm he and his family have been received as tour guides when they have been in Palestine. It was very warm and encouraging just listening to him describe that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is here today with his wife Donna and two of his daughters, Katie and Stephanie, as well as with many of his extended family. They are all enjoying this moment with Pastor Paul, and we welcome all of you here today, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Paul, thank you for your life of faith, your leadership of the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, and for your service to the community of Polson, MT, and to many others who I know attend your church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
