    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome last week's vote in the Senate ratifying the protocols on the accession of Albania and Croatia to the NATO Alliance. The membership of these two countries will strengthen the Alliance, contribute to the stability of the Balkans, and reinforce democracy in the region. Less than 15 years after NATO sent peacekeeping troops to the Balkans to halt a bloody war, it is a tribute to these nations' commitment to reforms that we are today one step closer to extending  our Alliance and solidifying the peace. Albania and Croatia will strengthen the Alliance by providing more capability to help meet NATO's broader security missions. All NATO member states should be encouraged to ratify the accession agreement for Albania and Croatia so that they can formally join the Alliance at NATO's 60th anniversary summit next April.</paragraph>
