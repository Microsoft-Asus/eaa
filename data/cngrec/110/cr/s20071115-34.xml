    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the career and achievements of a great military officer, civilian leader, and friend. After a long and distinguished career culminating with nearly 44 years of service, LTG David Poythress will retire from the United States Air National Guard, with the honor of being the first adjutant general of Georgia to reach the rank of lieutenant general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Poythress was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1964, a time in our Nation's history when serving in the military brought with it not only a requirement to face the enemy abroad but also the willingness to serve despite a divided nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Poythress received his law degree from Emory University in 1967 and was a distinguished graduate of Emory's ROTC program. Shortly thereafter, he was called to active duty and served 1 year as chief of military justice at DaNang Air Base, Vietnam. He served as a judge advocate general in the Air Force Reserve, rising from the rank of captain to brigadier general. During this same time period, complimenting his military career, he served the State of Georgia honorably as the assistant attorney  general, the deputy state revenue commissioner, the secretary of State of Georgia, and the State labor commissioner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, he was appointed as the adjutant general of Georgia, with his tenure encompassing what may be the Georgia National Guard's most dynamic and demanding period in its 243-year history. Under General Poythress's leadership, the Georgia National Guard deployed nearly 10,000 soldiers and airmen around the world in support of the global war on terror, and more than 2,200 guardsmen to help Gulf Coast States following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The Georgia Guard completed high profile/high  risk security missions following September 11, 2001, and also conducted dangerous operations on the Mexican border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Poythress's contributions will be appreciated by generations of Georgia guardsmen far in the future. He was successful in achieving the long-standing Georgia goal of legislation and funding for a State retirement plan for traditional guardsmen. He led the Georgia National Guard in winning the Oglethorpe Award for performance excellence. He also oversaw Robins Air Force Base's 116th Air Control Wing's transition from B-1s to a highly modernized Joint STARS unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Poythress's noteworthy service and responsibilities have been widely recognized. His distinguished honors include the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal with one device, the Air Force Commendation Medal with one device, the Vietnam Service Medal with one device and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Georgia National Guard will miss General Poythress's commitment to duty, ceaseless drive for improvement, and unwavering support for guardsmen, soldiers, and airmen everywhere. Although I will miss his service in the capacity as adjutant general, I am especially pleased that he will remain in the great State of Georgia and continue to serve both publicly and privately as he has done throughout his life. I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing him well in all his future endeavors and  hope that those who follow in his footsteps will continue his legacy of support to Georgia and our great Nation.</paragraph>
