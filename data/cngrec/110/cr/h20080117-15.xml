    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when Congress considers competing proposals to stimulate the economy, why not take a businesslike approach and consider the "metrics" of previous efforts? When the current administration took office, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 10,587. Yesterday, it was 12,472, representing a gain of 18 percent over 7 years. Unemployment and poverty rates are higher. Our debt is staggering. Our trade deficit is the highest in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the previous Democratic administration, the Dow Jones Industrials rose 328 percent over an 8-year period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unemployment fell every year, millions were lifted out of poverty, and we achieved a budget surplus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this time around, ask yourself, which model works for me? Which model was better? I think the facts speak for themselves.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
