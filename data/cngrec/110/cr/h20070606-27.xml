    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court, the judicial branch of our government, has ruled that the President of the United States is not above the law, even during time of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Attorney General's office within the executive branch of government is undermining the entire judicial system. Over 400 U.S. attorneys have been  confirmed over the last 20 years. Three have been fired for political partisanship during that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in the last 9 months, nine have been fired because they didn't bow to the partisan pressures of the executive branch of government. The Attorney General has allowed these nine U.S. attorneys names to be trashed in the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is worse than Watergate. There is reason to believe that a cover-up occurred, and that will be worse than the dirty deed. How did each of these get on the list in the first place? And out of the original 30, how did you get off the list? What did you have to do to be removed from that list, Mr. Attorney General?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the moral high ground. No one is above the law.</paragraph>
