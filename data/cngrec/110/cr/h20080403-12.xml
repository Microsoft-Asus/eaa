  <narrative>THE COOPER-WOLF SAFE COMMISSION ACT: BIPARTISANSHIP REQUIRED -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1976]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week the annual Medicare trustees report concluded that consideration of reforms to ensure the financial security of Medicare must occur in the near future. The report states, "The sooner the solutions are enacted, the more flexible and gradual they can be." As lawmakers, we are obligated, on economic and moral grounds, to tackle this enormous issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Newspaper headlines in the days following the release of the report say as follows, "Should political stalemate end, entitlement solution possible"; "Entitlement reform cannot wait on politics"; "Budget experts left and right urge action on entitlements."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day that the Congress doesn't act, nor the administration, we miss an opportunity for our children and our grandchildren to get this country moving. Congressman Cooper and I have a bill called the SAFE Commission. It's a bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also, Mr. Speaker, disappointed that Secretary Paulson has failed to address this issue. He said he feels like he is playing solitaire. Secretary Paulson, there are 74 cosponsors in the House, 40 Republicans, 34 Democrats that are waiting for you to do something. Secretary Paulson, if you leave this administration with failing to do that, you will regret it.</paragraph>
