  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with great pride that today I honor my dear friend and fellow Georgian, Willard Lasseter, who recently completed his 50th year with John Deere's Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. Willard and I not only share a strong desire for a successful agriculture sector throughout Georgia and the United States, but we also share the same hometown of Moultrie, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Willard began his many years of service to the farmers of Colquitt County in 1945 when he began to work part time for the local John Deere dealership. In 1956, with a little over $14,000 in borrowed money, Willard purchased a 25 percent share of the John Deere dealership and on December 1, 1956, Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. had its first day of business. By 1959, Willard, along with help from his father, had secured the remaining shares of the John Deere dealership. The success of the business  was almost instantaneous as Lasseter Tractor Company became the No. 1 dealer in terms of sales volume for the Atlanta branch of John Deere dealerships by 1960.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its first day of business Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. has been a model dealership for Deere and Company. Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc.'s many accomplishments include being named to the John Deere's Manager Club for 12 consecutive years, being a John Deere Signature Dealer for top performance in the market place for 5 consecutive years, and being a Gold Star dealer for top performance in commercial products in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. has also garnered the  top market share in the Atlanta branch of dealerships for 3 consecutive years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the years, Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. has continued to expand and prosper. In the late 1990's Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. began construction of a state-of-the-art dealership and service facility that encompasses over 45,000 square feet. The service center itself can accommodate over 20 cotton pickers. This is not only an important feature but it is also a necessary feature because Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc., is among the top dealerships for sales and servicing of cotton pickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc., spans south Georgia with dealerships in three counties. Not only has the business increased in size but also in the number of generations that are now involved in the business. Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc., now includes Willard's son Tony and grandson Judd, who oversee the day-to-day operations of the business. One philosophy that Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc., has maintained throughout its existence is: "You must give your customers the best product  at the fairest price possible." This is a philosophy that has allowed the company to continue to meet and exceed the needs of its customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to imagine what the state of agriculture might be in southwest Georgia if that young high school student, Willard Lasseter, did not step into the John Deere dealership in Moultrie, GA, in 1945 to begin working part time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud of the milestone that Willard has just met and it is my sincere hope that he continues his success in the agribusiness community for many years to come. I want to thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to recognize my dear friend Willard Lasseter.</paragraph>
