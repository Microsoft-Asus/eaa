    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in honor of SGT Randy J. Matheny, 20, of McCook, NE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Matheny followed in the footsteps of his older siblings when he joined the Nebraska Army National Guard on March 28, 2005, as a heavy vehicle driver in Detachment 1, 1057th Transportation Company in Scottsbluff. His older sister, SSG Karen Matheny, is a full-time member of the Nebraska Army National Guard's HHD, 734th Transportation Battalion in Kearney. PFC Pat Matheny, his older brother, is an active-duty soldier with the U.S. Army. Both of Sergeant Matheny's siblings are serving in  Iraq; his sister is currently serving her second tour, and his brother is preparing to deploy for his first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Matheny graduated from my alma mater, McCook Senior High School, in 2004. His teachers and friends knew him as a well-known, soft-spoken student. In his free time, he enjoyed riding his motorcycle and spending time with his friends. After joining the Nebraska Army National Guard in 2005, he attended basic training at Fort Jackson, SC, and then advanced individual training at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June 2006, he transferred as a heavy vehicle driver to the Nebraska Army National Guard Detachment 3, 1074th Transportation Company based in Sidney. Sergeant Matheny was mobilized for duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on July 15, 2006. The 1074th Transportation Company is responsible for providing security for transportation missions throughout Iraq. On February 4, 2007, Sergeant Matheny passed away when an improvised explosive device detonated next to the armored security vehicle  in which he was serving as a gunner. He was 20 years old. Then-Specialist Matheny was posthumously promoted to sergeant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Matheny family from my hometown of McCook, NE, are the paradigm of courage and selflessness. In addition to his brother and sister, Sergeant. Matheny is survived by his father Gary Matheny and mother Jan Collins. I offer my condolences to Sergeant Matheny's family and friends who inspired and supported his career. He made the ultimate and most valorous sacrifice so that future generations around the world will live free, peaceful lives. Sergeant Matheny will be forever remembered as a hero.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="COLONEL BRIAN ALLGOOD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to praise the memory of Army COL Brian Dwayne Allgood of the 30th Medical Brigade, European Regional Medical Command. Colonel Allgood was taken from his family late last month in Iraq. He was only 46 years old, and the highest ranking medical officer in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating high school in Colorado Springs, Brian Allgood attended the U.S. Military Academy in West Point and medical school at the University of Oklahoma. He completed his residency at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio and continued with his military career, rising to become one of the Army's top surgeons. Most recently, before being sent to Iraq, Colonel Allgood spent 2 years as the commanding officer of medical facilities in Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise that Brian Allgood rose to such great heights. Brian came from a medical family and a military family--Brian's father Jerry was an Army hospital administrator like his son, and Brian's mother Cleo was a nurse. One might say that service, both to his country and to those in need, was in his blood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brian Allgood was a healer, a quiet and humble man who knew the best way to lead was not through anger or boastfulness. Instead, he simply did what needed to be done, helping save and improve lives every day, and in doing so led by example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Allgood acted not only with courage but with concern for the troops he led. He was renowned for his willingness to stick his neck out for his troops and for his unique bond with them. To better understand the risks posed to paratroopers, Colonel Allgood completed the grueling Ranger school and parachuted into Panama in 1989. He served as the commanding officer of the hospital at West Point. As a surgeon and later a commanding medical officer, he played a role in the saving of hundreds,  if not thousands, of American lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as the top Army surgeon in Iraq, Colonel Allgood also oversaw the system that tended Iraqis in need of urgent care. Every day we hear stories from Iraq of innocent bystanders facing brutality in their own streets. Who knows how many Iraqis are alive today because of the talent and wisdom of Colonel Allgood and those he led?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Allgood's parents, Jerry and Cleo, have been supportive of not only their son but all Colorado veterans, and I am privileged to have worked with them on veterans concerns in my State. Jerry and Cleo are good people and should take great pride in having raised their son from a young boy into an exemplary man: a fine doctor, a thoughtful son and brother, a loving husband, and a caring father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Brian's wife Jane and his son Wyatt, I cannot imagine the sorrow and loss you are feeling, and I hope that in time your grief can be salved by your pride in the way Brian lived his life. Brian served his Nation with honor and distinction and improved the lives of countless soldiers, families and those with whom he interacted every day.</paragraph>
