  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I further sought recognition to comment briefly about the scheduling of the hearing for Attorney General designate Eric Holder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In looking toward the hearing process, I am looking for a very constructive engagement to determine the qualifications of Mr. Holder. There is no intent on my part or on the part of any of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle to engage in partisan sniping. As I say, we intend to be constructive and not destructive. We are looking to strengthen the Department of Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The position of Attorney General is an extraordinarily important position. We have seen that during the administration of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, stated candidly, the Department was not well handled. That is a candid statement and also a very mild statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of Attorney General Gonzales' tenure, there were so many situations where the Attorney General molded his views to accommodate his appointer, the President of the United States. A great deal that went on in the Department of Justice was partisan and not in the interests of the work of the Department or in the interests of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen, since 9/11/2001, a vast extension of Executive authority. We found the terrorist surveillance program was initiated by the President without consultation under the tradition of notifying the chairman, which I was during the 109th Congress, or the ranking member. We found there was an engagement with the telephone companies to engage in electronic surveillance, again without notifying the chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and without notifying the intelligence  committees of both Houses, as mandated by law. Further was the expansion of signing statements all during the tenure of the Attorney General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without going into the issues of politicization, they were rampant during the tenure of Attorney General Gonzales. I refer to an article, coauthored by the current chairman of the committee and myself, which appeared not too long ago in Politico, on October 28, 2008, where we said in part:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Attorney General must be someone who deeply appreciates and respects the work and commitment of the thousands of men and women who work in the branches and divisions of the Justice Department, day in and day out, without regard to politics or ideology, doing their best to enforce the law and promote justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to Attorney General designate Holder, there is no doubt he comes to this nomination with an outstanding record, for the most part. Not without question but for the most part. He has an excellent educational background from Columbia: undergrad and law degree, a trial attorney in the Department of Justice, an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, U.S. attorney, Deputy Attorney General, Acting Attorney General--a very distinguished r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, which  I have recited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are questions which have to be inquired into fairly, as already noted in the commentaries of the media on the editorial pages. There has been considerable publicity about the pardon of Marc Rich. There was a case involving Mr. Rich, who was a fugitive, who had given very substantial sums of money to entities connected to the President. The regular procedures for a pardon were bypassed. The Department of Justice was not consulted. The attorneys in the Southern District of New York, which  was handling the Rich case, were opposed to the pardon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my own days as district attorney of Philadelphia, where I dealt with celebrated cases involving people who were fugitives, who had fled, that is about as serious a matter as you could find and hardly one where there would be an expectation of leniency or pardon to wipe out the charge, eliminate the matter, while the defendant was in absentia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was an extensive report filed on this issue by the House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, the 107th Congress, second session. It is available for anyone to read. There are quite a number of very serious questions involving what happened with Mr. Holder and the people involved there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concern that arises is why Mr. Holder lent the recommendation, which has been characterized as neutral leaning in favor, in this context. I come to no conclusions on the matter. I approach this matter, as I try to approach all matters, with an open mind. But in an extensive interview with Mr. Holder he has presented his views. I don't think it is useful to get into the specifics as to the precise concerns which I raised and his precise answers. Let that await a day where we have a hearing  and where Mr. Holder is in a position to speak for himself. But by analogy to the Gonzales tenure, I think it is imperative we be sure the Attorney General of the United States does not bend his views to accommodate his appointer; that the Attorney General does not bend his views in any way which is partisan or political, to serve any interest other than the interests of justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted in the article cited in Politico, where you have the professionals in the Department of Justice, they wouldn't even meet with attorneys for Mr. Rich, they thought it was such an open-and-shut case, and were opposed--at least according to information provided. This is all to be brought out at a hearing. But to run counter to the views of the professionals is a major red flag which has to be inquired into and inquired into with some depth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we have the situation where Attorney General Reno recused herself on the issue of appointing an independent counsel to investigate alleged--and I emphasize alleged--illegal fundraising by Vice President Albert Gore out of the White House. There was the relatively notorious incident where the Vice President was at a meeting and drank a lot of ice tea and absented himself from certain parts of the meeting where he was not able to--or had a rationale for not knowing certain things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I questioned Attorney General Reno in detail about that during Judiciary Committee hearings and she said: Well, there just wasn't sufficient evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had disregarded a document, a note taken by someone present, because, as she said, it did not refresh that witness's recollection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked her about the doctrine of prior recollection recorded, which is a well-known exception to the hearsay rule. She denied knowing about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note a frown on the face of the Presiding Officer, who is a distinguished district attorney herself. Doubtless we could speak at length about prior recollection recorded. I mention that because of the curious circumstances of what happened there. There we had an assistant U.S. attorney named LaBella, who was asked to take on the job of making a recommendation. According to the information provided to me, he made a recommendation for an independent counsel and the professionals in the Department  asked for an independent counsel, and it was overruled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to comment about Mr. Holder's role. Let him respond to that and let us take that up in due course. But here again is a potential situation where the interests of justice and objectivity were not followed in the highest levels of the Department of Justice when Mr. Holder was in charge, with the Attorney General, Attorney General Reno, having recused herself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many other matters which warrant inquiry, and I will not take the time to go into them now. They are  referenced in a letter which eight Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent to Attorney General Mukasey, requesting information from the Department of Justice files.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>

    <paragraph>When hearings were held for Attorney General Ashcroft, they were held from January 16 to January 19 of 2001. At that time, there were 2 days of testimony from Attorney General Ashcroft, and the committee heard from 23 outside witnesses. May I remind everyone that John Ashcroft was a well-known person to the committee. He had been in the Senate. He had served on the Judiciary Committee. We knew him very well. But that didn't stop a very full, detailed inquiry. It was not done in a  rush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to Mr. Holder's situation, we have in the committee some 86 boxes of archived committee documents relating to Mr. Holder's tenure in the Department of Justice. We expect those materials to increase very substantially when we receive materials from the Department of Justice and the Clinton Library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar document requests were made to the Department of Justice in the Reagan Library during the confirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts, and they yielded some 65,000 additional pages of documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As of the present time, we have not yet received Mr. Holder's questionnaire, his nomination materials, or the FBI background investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have taken the time to come to the floor to outline, very briefly, some of the issues. They are set out in more detail in the letter which is now made a part of the record to Attorney General Mukasey, asking for specific matters regarding Mr. Holder. There are other matters which are in the media which I think are better left for further investigation, even before the hearing, before there is any public comment about it. But we are looking at a very major matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Justice has enormous responsibilities in the battle against terrorism and in the protection of civil rights. That is a balance which has to be maintained. There are real questions as to whether it has been maintained since 9/11. Those are matters for inquiry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are very substantial matters to be inquired into on the Justice Department position on waiver of attorney-client privilege, which started with the Holder memorandum when he was Deputy Attorney General and then went forward to the Thompson memorandum and the McNulty memorandum and so forth. Also, there are major matters of legislation now pending on the subject of reporters' shield, where the Department of Justice has taken a view which I believe has to be modified by legislation if we cannot  get some accommodation with the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a very brief statement as to the issues which we are looking for. As I look at this matter, it seems to me  not realistic or fair to begin hearings before January 26.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The week of January 19 is going to be occupied with the inauguration. And to have adequate time to prepare, it seems to me, that needs to be done. When we had hearings involving Chief Justice Roberts and Associate Justice Alito, consideration was made of the minority point of view, and extensive discussions were had, and there was an accommodation and agreement reached as to when the hearing was to be held.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are looking at a serious matter and we have to do it right. It is going to take some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="GUIDELINES">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
