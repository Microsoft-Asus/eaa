    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor America's brave men and women currently serving in the name of freedom and to oppose this resolution of retreat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Abraham Lincoln said famously in his second inaugural address: "Fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away." As Americans we are reluctant warriors, but throughout our rich history, whenever our troops have been in  harm's way America has supported the men and women in uniform and made certain our troops have the necessary resources to accomplish their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a doubt, mistakes have been made, and these mistakes are important to acknowledge, but we must go forward with a new strategy in Iraq based on quantifiable goals and measurable results. We must not retreat. At this critical time, the American people long for true leadership and resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to put aside political posturing and partisanship and ensure our troops have the resources and support needed to complete this mission. Victory is the only option.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
