  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="3311">H.R. 3311</bill>) to authorize additional funds for emergency repairs and reconstruction of the Interstate I-35 bridge located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that collapsed on August 1, 2007, to waive the $100,000,000 limitation on emergency relief funds for those emergency repairs and reconstruction, and for other purposes, as amended.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the bill.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on the bill, <bill type="h" number="3311">H.R. 3311</bill>, and include extraneous material in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Minnesota?</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me express my great appreciation to my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation for their cohesion and their support of legislative action to respond promptly to the needs of the people of Minneapolis and the State of Minnesota. Mr. Ramstad, Mr. Kline, Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Ellison, in whose district this tragedy occurred, Ms. McCollum, Mr. Walz, Mr. Peterson have all united as one in support of the needs  of the people and in common mourning for the tragedy that occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us were struck deeply within our souls over this tragedy. Ms. McCollum's daughter, just miraculously almost, passed over this bridge shortly before it collapsed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my great appreciation to the gentleman from Florida, the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Mica, and his staff and to Mr. Petri, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Mr. DeFazio of Oregon, Chair of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, for the cooperation, for the splendid efforts made, and for the common cause in which we all persevered to bring this legislation promptly to  the House, as we are doing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, I'm very grateful to the gentleman from Florida for his participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bridges are built to last, not forever, but for a very long time. The title, in Latin, of the leader of the Catholic church is Pontifex Maximus, the maximum bridge builder. And when that title was adopted, bridges were built to last. The one in Rome has lasted 2,000 years, a marble arch bridge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in our day and time, not much that we build lasts forever, and that is why we have a bridge inspection program. That is why we annually evaluate the condition, structure and structural integrity of bridges and their operational capacity and ability; and why, in the current law, SAFETEA-LU, with the help of then Chairman Young, I included language to authorize the funding of a new technology comparable to the technology used in aviation to determine the structural integrity of aircraft  wings, movable surfaces and fuselage, to find hairline cracks using technology that can discover microscopic cracks not visible to the naked eye and then measure their propagation and do the same with bridges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Minnesota Department of Transportation was offered the opportunity to use that technology, and I am disappointed that the State rejected the opportunity to use that technology to test the structural integrity of the bridge that collapsed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March of 2004, I sent Members of the House a letter and information providing data developed, at my request, by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics showing the number and location of structurally deficient bridges in the national highway system in each Member's congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, not many Members followed up on that, but I just happen to have in front of me the letter addressed to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) who did respond. The letter pointed out the number of structurally deficient bridges in each Member's district and then pointed out that, in 2002, the U.S. Department of Transportation found that 167,566 of the Nation's bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Since then, that number has grown to, of the 597,340 bridges  in the national bridge inventory, 26 percent are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the cost to repair and bring to a good state of maintenance, the cost in 2004, was estimated at $9.4 billion a year to maintain. In the SAFETEA-LU legislation, we provided $4 billion a year. It should have been at $5 billion. If the original introduced bill Mr. Young and I introduced in October of 2003 had prevailed, we'd have been at $5 billion a year. We are where we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is the map, in smaller form, that we sent out to all Members of the House in 2004. For the State of Minnesota, it lists all the structurally deficient bridges. There are 19 on this list updated today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Minnesota has 13,000 bridges. 1,135 are structurally deficient. 451 are functionally obsolescent. That's 12.2 percent. That's one of the lowest percentages in the country, but it underscores the serious problem of the State of Minnesota and of the Nation's bridges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We come to the floor today united in purpose to help the State rebuild this structure. The estimate from the Minnesota Department of Transportation is in the range of $200 plus million, which may grow, depending on the bridge abutments on both sides of the river; and the structural integrity of those facilities has yet to be fully evaluated. So the $250 million is a soundly based estimate, based on engineering evaluations, and is a fair number, and so is the funding that we provide in the legislation  to compensate the State for the shift from highway transportation to transit as occurred in California, in Oakland earlier this year in April when their bridge collapsed due to a tanker truck collapse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the basic figures. Those are the justifications. We've limited, capped the dollar amount for transit at $5 million in response to a question from the other body, and we have a well-supported figure of $250 million for the reconstruction out of general revenue funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appeal for the support of this body for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="MICA" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3311">H.R. 3311</bill> and join the gentleman from Minnesota whose State and area has been hit by this terrible, horrible tragedy that's taken lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on our side of the aisle, when we do have a national tragedy of this nature, we do try to pull together in a bipartisan manner to address the needs of people who have suffered this type of, again, horrible disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) has taken a leadership role today in approving this money; and I'm pleased, as the Republican leader, to also come forward and lend our support for this authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, many people have asked me what we're doing here today. And we are authorizing $250 million for repair and reconstruction of the I-35 bridge over the Mississippi River. Now that's authorization and Federal authorization. It is not funding, and there must be appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might say that we're doing that because the authorization fund, the Highway Emergency Relief Fund, unfortunately, we had $100 million and it's depleted. Not only is that $100 million depleted but also the reserve and additional money that was put in in the supplemental is depleted. So that's why we're doing this for our friends and colleagues and those who have suffered this loss in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's my hope that this bridge will be built in rapid order and replaced; and I know that the good custodians in Minnesota, with their Transportation Department, will work to see that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me say that the Minnesota bridge is only, unfortunately, the tip of the iceberg in an aging infrastructure and transportation system that we have in this country. We have, out of almost 600,000 bridges, about 80,000 bridges that are structurally deficient. Twenty-seven percent of our bridges are structurally deficient or obsolete, according to one of the most recent studies; and the infrastructure, not  just in bridges but in highways, in ports,  in airports, in rail, is inadequate and it's outdated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I proposed as a solution recently a national strategic transportation plan. The American Council of Civil Engineers has estimated this will take $1.7 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a national plan to restore our infrastructure from sea to shining sea, where we have congestion, where we have bridges falling into our rivers and where we have inadequate infrastructure on which to conduct the business of this country or just get around our congested communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we need a bigger plan, and then we need a way to finance that plan, and I look forward to working with all of the Members in trying to develop that plan and with this administration and the next administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So finally, as I close with my initial thoughts, I want to say that our prayers go out to the people of Minnesota, especially the families of those affected by this tragedy. And I pledge from our side of the aisle again to work with every Member in Congress and with the folks in Minnesota to bring things back to regular order there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Minneapolis (Mr. Ellison).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="ELLISON" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the distinguished chairman of the Transportation Committee and also thank all the members of the Minneapolis delegation and every single Member of this esteemed body. This is the greatest deliberative body in the world and in the history of the world. And the evidence of that is that not only, not only does this body thoroughly debate issues, but when tragedy strikes one, people respond in the most humanitarian way. Even though we have strong points  of difference of opinion, when tragedy strikes America, we have no Republicans, we have no Democrats. We just have Members of Congress who are responsive to the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Chair, I want to thank you for your bold, decisive action. I want to thank all the members of the community in Minnesota who have responded, not only the official responders but the good Samaritans as well. And let me urge every Member to support this most important measure that will restore our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, again, it is the tip of the iceberg. We need a new national commitment to the infrastructure of this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="MICA" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the Republican subcommittee leader on the Highways Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DUNCAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, Ranking Member Mica, for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this bill, offered by our distinguished chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, my good friend (Mr. Oberstar), along with my good friend (Mr. Mica).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our condolences, in fact the condolences of the entire Nation, go out to the people of Minnesota who were affected by this terrible tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to recognize Mr. Oberstar's leadership and his efforts to provide an immediate response to this incident. Less than 18 hours after the I-35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River, Mr. Oberstar introduced this bill, <bill type="h" number="3311">H.R. 3311</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes funding to help the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area get back on its feet. It authorizes $250 million from the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program for the repair and reconstruction of the I-35W bridge that collapsed Wednesday night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Secretary of Transportation, Mary Peters, went to Minneapolis, visited the site, and immediately made available $5 million to pay for traffic-flow adjustments and debris removal associated with this disaster. But this bill takes the first step in providing funding to repair and rebuild this bridge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we will not know for several months the final cost to repair and rebuild the I-35W bridge, this bill demonstrates the House's support and certainly the strong commitment from our committee to rebuild this bridge and restore some sense of normalcy to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there was a column in The Washington Post today that repeated some of the statistics you have just heard from the gentleman from Georgia about the number of deficient bridges, but this columnist also said this: "It's unrealistic to think this disaster is going to spur the Nation to seriously address all its infrastructure problems. We'll talk about the issue for a while, then go out and buy another TV. But we can, and should, at least do a more rigorous inventory and identify the  structures that pose the most peril. Yes, it's boring stuff to even think about. But just look at the alternative."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are very true words, Mr. Speaker, and I pledge the support of our subcommittee and to work with all the leadership on our committee to not do what this columnist has said and just forget about this or move on to something else too quickly. We owe that to the people of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="McCOLLUM" of="Minnesota">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chair, 2 days ago my daughter did have a best friend who was crossing the Mississippi River. She crossed long before the bridge collapsed. Only 2 days ago the world witnessed the collapse of a massive bridge that crosses the Mississippi River, America's heartland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world is now witnessing America's heroism, our first responders, our community leaders, and all of our citizens coming together to rescue victims, to heal the injured, and to mourn those lost. As of today, we know more than 130 people have been treated for injuries, 5 individuals have lost their lives, including 2 of my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to the families of the known victims: Sherry Lou Engebretsen of Shoreview, Patrick Holmes of Mounds View, Julia Blackhawk of Savage, and Artemeeo Trinidad-Meena of Minneapolis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minneapolis and my home of St. Paul, we are the Twin Cities. Together our cities are united, along with all of our surrounding communities, in responding to this disaster and addressing the massive redistribution of traffic to meet the needs of commuters and businesses as a result of the bridge collapse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My dear friend from Minneapolis, Congressman Keith Ellison, has my full support as our communities work together to heal and rebuild. The people of Minneapolis are fortunate to have Congressman Ellison working for them, and we are all proud to stand with him, as his constituents are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota is also blessed to have Chairman Oberstar leading the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in the House. Chairman Oberstar is leading this bill and will lead our Nation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesotans are facing the pain, the loss, and the immense transportation challenges resulting from this bridge collapse. But every American in every State now feels an unavoidable fear about everyday risks. This week the phrase "structurally deficient" became part of our Nation's vocabulary. This week millions of Americans use bridges that have been deemed structurally deficient or, even worse, functionally obsolete. Imagine trusting your family's safety and well-being to a bridge that is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American families should not have to worry about this. Passage of this bill will do one small step in rebuilding and uniting a community and a State, but we must make sure that every American family feels safe.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="MICA" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished former Chair of the T&amp;I Committee and the senior Republican on the T&amp;I Committee, Transportation and Infrastructure, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <narrative>(Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="YOUNG" of="Alaska">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I first want to congratulate the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and the Minnesota delegation in expediting this process  with the leadership of Mr. Mica and the leadership of both sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't do this often when I say I told you so. As chairman, with Mr. Oberstar, we tried to put the money in to identify the weaknesses of the bridges and to repair them, and we were unsuccessful. We ended up with a $286 billion bill instead of a $375 billion bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. and Mrs. America, I believe it is time for us to wake up. We have to repair our outdated infrastructure, especially our bridges. You have heard statistics, 11,000 and on and on, how many are deficient. But there are about 500 in the same shape as the bridge in Minnesota right now that are a potential death trap to constituencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to, as a Congress, grasp this problem and, yes, lo and behold, I would even suggest fund this problem with a tax. May the sky not fall on me, but with a tax. Make it a 3-year tax. Make it a 5-cent tax, and they will say we can't do that. But I would suggest respectfully that the American people will understand the importance if we fund it and if we address the issue of the bridges. We should do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And maybe this is a wake-up call, and I hope The Post is wrong, that we all don't go back to sleep and watch football this fall and forget this tragic accident, because if we do so, then we are not fulfilling our obligation and our duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand here before you today saying I told you so. But I am also saying let's act as we should to protect our people in every one of our States.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from Alaska for his leadership on SAFETEA-LU and for the participation we enjoyed together in crafting that and previous legislation. I thank him for his comments, with which I concur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the Speaker, the gentlewoman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="PELOSI" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you, Mr. Oberstar, you and Mr. Mica, for your leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor in such an expeditious manner so we can remove all doubt in anyone's mind in Minnesota that we are there for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A disaster of this kind, I know, coming from California where we have had our earthquakes and others coming from places that had been struck by one disaster or another, that people wonder if the compact between themselves and the government is real, and today you are telling them that it is so. We can extend all of the sympathy in our hearts to the people who have lost their loved ones or who have been injured or have just been struck by the tragedy in such an extraordinary way, but we also have  to not only extend compassion but present assistance. And for that I want to thank you Mr. Oberstar, and Mr. Walz, Congresswoman McCollum, Mr. Ellison. My sympathy to you and your constituents for all that you are suffering, Mr. Peterson, as well from the State of Minnesota and our Republican colleagues from the State of Minnesota as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes in the course of events, there comes a coming together of a person and an event that is almost God given. And I think that is this case, Mr. Oberstar. No one in the country knows more than you do about the infrastructure of our country, the needs that we have out there, and the solutions that are the best ones. We are sad that your State was stricken, but maybe it is fortuitous for the country because it hit home for you. The spotlight is on your State. The spotlight is on  your committee as we reach out with this $250 million for the highway emergency fund. I think that the opportunity that is there and the knowledge, wisdom, solutions that you know better than anyone will serve our country very well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really appreciated the remarks of the gentleman from Alaska. We do have to make an investment in our infrastructure. In this case, no maintenance is the most expensive maintenance, as the people in Minnesota found out as some of their loved ones paid with their lives. So we have to figure out a way to pay as we go, no deficit spending, but understand that a capital budget is necessary to invest in the infrastructure of our country. It is what we owe the American people. It is about our environment,  by relieving congestion. It is about quality time for families to spend less time on the roads. And as we learned, of course, and always knew but what was driven home in Minnesota, it is about the safety of our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine, to be a mom or dad and to have a loved one leave home, a husband or wife, sister or brother, leave home in the morning or sometime during the day, of all the things you can protect your children from, of all the anticipation that you can have, you would never think, What if the bridge goes down? We want to remove that fear from America's families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I know, Mr. Oberstar, that you are in a position to do so. I'm sure you will let us know how we can all help. And, Mr. Mica, you as well. This is bringing us together this evening in a very special way. I hope it is a comfort to the families who lost their loved ones that so many people in our country feel this as a personal loss and are praying for them at this very difficult time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 1/2  minutes to probably one of the most capable and compassionate Members of the House I know and the senior Republican of the Minnesota delegation, the gentleman, Mr. Ramstad.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="RAMSTAD" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished ranking member, my friend, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, no Minnesotan will ever forget August 1, 2007. No Minnesotan will ever forget the day the I-35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River. No Minnesotan will forget the tragic loss of life, the serious injuries, and the incredible devastation caused by the falling eight-lane bridge. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, the survivors and their families as well as the brave first responders who have worked night and day on rescue and recovery operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My special thanks go out to the firefighters, the law enforcement personnel, the EMS personnel as well as the Minnesota National Guard and countless Good Samaritans for their heroic rescue and recovery efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A special thanks, Mr. Speaker, to Governor Pawlenty for his great leadership as well as Hennepin County sheriff Rich Stanek, Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak, Representative KEITH ELLISON, and the rest of our Minnesota congressional delegation who have come together. I want to particularly thank the dean of our delegation, Chairman JIM OBERSTAR, for his extraordinary leadership in moving this delegation bill before the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask all of our colleagues for their overwhelming bipartisan support to pass this crucial bill tonight so we can authorize funds for emergency repairs and reconstruction of the I-35 bridge that collapsed last Wednesday. Also, Mr. Speaker, we need the funds for much-needed emergency relief as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time of great need, Mr. Speaker, the good people of Minnesota are very grateful. We thank all of you for your support. We thank the Nation for their thoughts and prayers. We thank God that we live in a country where we can come together to help each other at our time of greatest need.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="WALZ" of="Minnesota">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentleman, my fellow Minnesotan, the chairman of Transportation, and, as the Speaker of the House so aptly put, no one in this country knows more about this issue. If there's anyone that comes close, it's the distinguished ranking member from Florida, a gentleman that as sitting on the Transportation Committee, I've come to see the wisdom of his words and the commitment to this country's infrastructure. So I think the Speaker of the House is right,  two gentlemen that are showing incredible leadership on this and that our Nation should feel incredibly proud to have you there. I thank you both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A special thank you to all my colleagues in this House. The citizens of Minnesota in responding to this have witnessed something that I think most of us here should be incredibly proud of. In less than 48 hours of this tragedy, this body came together, crafted a piece of legislation to provide relief,  and is prepared tonight to deliver that forward to them. To the people who are out there, those citizens, those first responders, our elected officials,  from Governor Pawlenty to Mayor Rybak and right down the line have been there working together, showing that this great Nation when we put our mind to it and come together to relieve the suffering of one another can get exactly that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's with a heavy heart that all of us are here, but it's one of optimism and forward-looking that we will address the needs of Minnesota, and, as the distinguished gentleman from Alaska so aptly put, we're prepared to make sure that this never happens again and another family never has to find out that a bridge collapsed as their family members were coming home.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 1/2  minutes to another outstanding Member of the Minnesota delegation, Mr. Kline.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="KLINE" of="Minnesota">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to add my thanks to all of our colleagues here in the House, the Minnesota delegation certainly, and, of course, as Mr. Ramstad said, to our dean, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Oberstar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While reports continue to be updated due to the ongoing recovery operations, the number of victims is already shocking to us in Minnesota. But these numbers are not simply statistics that might roll off the tongue as a footnote to a tragedy which Governor Tim Pawlenty accurately described as, quote, a catastrophe of historic proportions for Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, these numbers are people. These numbers are the family, friends and neighbors who were simply going home to their loved ones after  what appeared to be just another workday. Among the deceased is a mother of two from Savage, Minnesota, in my congressional district, and my heart and prayers go to her family and to all the victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this is a time of sorrow for many, there are countless stories emerging already about the generosity and compassion of the citizens of Minnesota. From organizing blood drives and volunteers, to caring for the needs of the recovery workers, Minnesotans are going above and beyond the call of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the citizens of Minnesota have come together during this difficult time, my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation and I remain committed to helping restore the I-35W bridge. Together, we're working to provide the Federal resources necessary to recover from this tragedy, and the fine effort brought forward by our chairman, Mr. Oberstar, putting forth $250 million is so important to us in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of this disaster, it is difficult to imagine when all the questions will be answered, but the day will come when recovery efforts will be complete, investigations will conclude, and eventually a new I-35 bridge will reunite the banks of the Mississippi River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families and with all Minnesotans as we recover and rebuild. Again, I want to thank the gentleman, the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, for authoring this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>I would like to inquire how much time remains on both sides.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Minnesota has 5 1/2  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Florida has 7 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin, our neighboring State (Mr. Kind).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="KIND" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago our Nation watched with shock and horror as the I-35 bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. Many of the residents of my congressional district in western Wisconsin make a daily commute to their jobs in the twin cities. Many of them over this very bridge. Their safety and the safety of all of our residents is our utmost concern. Our thoughts and prayers go out this evening to the victims of that great tragedy along with their families and the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at moments of great tragedy, Mr. Speaker, there are also moments of great triumph, of strangers coming to the aid of strangers, the first responders answering that emergency call, health care providers administering first aid and taking care of the injured during this great tragedy. And now it's our turn. It's our turn as a Nation. It's our turn as a Congress to come together and make sure we pass this authorization for the appropriation of funds so we can begin rebuilding this important  bridge but also help the community rebuild and to ensure that this tragedy is never repeated anywhere else throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the leadership of the Transportation Committee, the chairman and the ranking member, the members of the committee, but especially the Minnesota delegation for how they've been able to rally amongst themselves but also to get this body to come together during this time of crucial need to do the right thing, step up and to assume our responsibility as a great Nation and come to the aid of those who have suffered during this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the newest Member of the Minnesota delegation, a rising star in Congress, and the people of Minnesota are very fortunate to have her here at this time (Mrs. Bachmann).</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="BACHMANN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In what feels now like a lifetime ago but was in fact only 2 days ago, on August 1, the world changed forever for the people of our State of Minnesota. Our people witnessed an event so unlikely, the sudden and complete collapse of nearly 2,000 feet of eight lanes of highway, propelling nearly 50 cars in midair for a horrific 60-foot plunge into the currents of the Mississippi River. An event so unlikely that we in Minnesota collectively remain shocked and filled with sorrow, knowing the inevitable  sad news that is yet to come once our heroic first responders have freed our fellow Americans who even now as we stand here remain trapped underwater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota needs the help and the prayers of all Americans and we appreciate the overwhelming support in our time of need. I know I speak for my husband Marcus and myself. We offer our deepest sympathies, as does everyone in our delegation, to the family and the friends of those who were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America believes in extending a helping hand to people who are in trouble due to no fault of their own, and I want to assure the residents of Minnesota today that we will have help in cleaning up and rebuilding. We will have help until the job is done. Because Congress understands, Republicans, Democrats, we're all Americans in this and we understand that this is not just an emergency for a day or for a week. We will provide the support and the work that is necessary to rebuild the  lives and the communities that were damaged until this tragedy is over. And that is what makes America so great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is just our first step toward recovery. I thank Chairman Oberstar for his brilliant work, working around the clock to bring this to the floor. It's inspiring the way so many have come together and worked together over these last few days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my colleagues from Minnesota, a great State that each one of us loves so much, in requesting your support to rebuild this bridge. Once again, I know we can count on you, the Members of this great deliberative body, to rebuild the great city of Minneapolis and again to make it whole.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kagen), a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="KAGEN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3311">H.R. 3311</bill>, and let's build that bridge together. This is an emergency resolution, to repair and reconstruct a functionally obsolete bridge, the I-35, which spanned two peoples, brought two peoples together, across a divide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And much in the same way, isn't it time that we begin to work together here in Congress? And by working together we will not just build a bridge across a divide but build a bridge between the parties which some in our  land may feel are also functionally obsolete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Here in Congress we can build a bridge together, and while we're at it, let's build a better Nation together as well. Because it's not about the party you're in, it's about doing the Nation's business and building a Nation for all of us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to yield 3 minutes to one of the most distinguished and senior Members, not only in Congress, but the senior member of the Florida delegation, former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Young, my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="YOUNG" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for yielding the time to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of the legislation to provide relief in response to the tragedy surrounding the collapse of Interstate 35W Bridge spanning the Mississippi River in Minneapolis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people in my area of Florida remember this type of grief, and we share the grief of the people of Minnesota. It was during a violent storm at 7:38 a.m. the morning of May 9, 1980, that a freighter, the Summit Venture, slammed into the Sunshine Skyway Bridge which spans Tampa Bay to connect my district to Manatee County in the south, across Tampa Bay. Thirty-five people in their vehicles fell more than 1,200 feet into the waters of Tampa Bay that morning, fell to their deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Sunshine Skyway is a Florida landmark. The scenes of the mangled bridge missing 1,260 feet of the center span of the southbound lanes of the bridge was a daily reminder of the tragedy, and we remember, and we remember for the people of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only two people survived the accident in Florida, one whose car skidded to a halt at the bridge's edge and the other who survived his pick-up truck's fall into the water and swam to safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 7 years, the damaged span stood as a constant reminder. Congress, however, began the healing process very shortly after that tragedy, as we do today for the Minnesota tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank and compliment and commend Chairman Oberstar and Mr. Mica, my good friend and colleague from Florida, who worked so hard on all of these issues and for moving this legislation quickly in a bipartisan way to bring support for the people of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House responded to my request for funding to help rebuild the Sunshine Skyway Bridge quickly in the same type of fashion. So, as I said, we remember and we share the grief that you suffer today because we went through it back in 1980; and this Member stands ready to help in any way that we can to not only pass this authorization bill but to pass the appropriations that go along with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, Mr. Mica, for yielding the time to me. He is an outstanding leader in our delegation; and he does, I think, an exceptional job for all of us.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="MICA" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The gentleman from Florida has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Minnesota has 2 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="MICA" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will yield myself the balance of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, Mr. Oberstar, I thank you for paying attention to the important responsibility you have, not only as Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee but as a good steward for the people of your State in a time of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, you know, it's amazing what we can do in this House. It's absolutely incredible. Mr. Young has been here for many years, and I have always looked up to him as one of our leaders. We started some years ago, senior to me, but I followed his career and what he has been able to do on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when we do have an emergency, whether it's 9/11 or whether it's a bridge that collapses in Minnesota, it's amazing what this House of Representatives can do when it comes together in a bipartisan fashion. That tragedy just occurred a matter of hours ago, and here we are, in our system, working together, helping those people. We're not going to solve this all by the Federal Government; and, as I said, this is only an authorization. But people are in need, and we came together, as this body  is designed to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, as I said, the bridge is just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. Our Nation's infrastructure is collapsing. Our Nation's infrastructure is obsolete. We have got to come together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We came together, Mr. Oberstar and I, with a Water Resources bill that hadn't been passed in 7 years, but we brought it here, it is now pending final approval, to build the Nation's dams and infrastructure, also important. And we see that if you don't pay now, you will pay later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we can do this. We can make the investment to build the infrastructure that makes our economy grow, that makes this a great country and allows free enterprise to give us the great life that we've had in this wonderful country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I look forward, Mr. Oberstar, to finalizing this with you and helping the people in this time of need and also in taking on a leadership position as we make the investment in our country that is so necessary in our infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="OBERSTAR" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the applause on our side for all of the speakers shows the depth of feeling, the depth of appreciation that the Minnesota delegation feels toward each other, toward others in the body who have spoken tonight, toward our ranking member, Mr. Mica, to whom, once again, I express my appreciation for the responsiveness and to prompt action on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Young, I remember so well the Sunshine Skyway Bridge tragedy and later included it in a hearing that then Mr. Clinger, my ranking member on the Investigation and Oversight Subcommittee, held hearings that included that tragedy. I was here to vote on the funding for that restoration of that bridge, and I appreciate the gentleman's recollection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will look back, I guess, in a few days, on this moment as a welcome respite from the cacophony of dissidence that we have heard in the last several hours in this body. Unfortunately, tragedy, loss of life and injury has brought us together, but it shows the greatness of this House of Representatives, that it can come together and find common cause and move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that respite from cacophony will prevail in the other body as we send this legislation forward and that there will not be, as has been threatened, procedural issues raised or jurisdictional matters that may be raised that might deter a provision of this legislation to provide respite from the congestion that will result in the reconstruction of this bridge and that already is occurring in the city of Minneapolis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House provided respite for Oakland, San Francisco in the collapse of the 580 and 880 structures just earlier this year, in April. We provide almost identical language and support in this legislation. I just hope the other body will not raise objections and move this legislation forward, because those are relatively minor matters that be can resolved in the management by DOT of that transit language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank all our colleagues for the dignity of this discussion tonight and for the support expressed for the people of Minnesota by the rest of the Nation. We thank you, thank all our colleagues, and we ask for a wholehearted vote in support of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="PETERSON" of="Minnesota">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the good people of Minnesota who have banded together to begin the healing process. When that bridge fell, every citizen of my State felt the grief and the pain together. It has certainly been a difficult couple of days for everyone, but I am so proud of the first responders, of the volunteers, and of my colleagues here in the House. I'd like to give a special thanks to Chairman Oberstar, for acting so quickly. He has represented  Minnesota, and the House, very well. I'd also like to say that Representative Ellison has done a remarkable job in representing his district during these last 48 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a shame that it sometimes takes the worst events to bring out the best in people, but I am so proud of the wonderful actions Minnesotans have taken to help the victims of  the I35W bridge. I think the people involved in the recovery actions have truly demonstrated the incredible character of Minnesota's citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing can replace what was lost on Wednesday. No amount of money will do that. Neither will a new bridge. But this bill is a strong step on the road to healing. Thank you Chairman Oberstar, thank you to the members of the Minnesota Delegation and thank you to all my colleagues who have helped support the citizens of my State.</paragraph>
