  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="RECOGNIZING MONFORTON SCHOOL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the achievements of an outstanding teacher and her seventh grade students. This is a story of community and folks coming together to make their town a better place to live. The students at Monforton School in Bozeman, MT, with their teacher, Sally Broughton, saw a playground at the school that was outdated and unsafe. These ambitious young people then sprung into action and set out to inform the principal, school board, other students, and  community members of the subpar condition of the playground and gathered input and support for building a new playground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Montana spirit of folks working together to make their community a better place to live, local businesses pitched in by donating nearly $40,000 worth of supplies and labor toward completion of the playground. Monforton parent and carpenter, Alan Ripley, worked with students to design the octagonal climbing structure for the playground. The students spent countless hours with volunteers in building the playground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the work of these students, their teacher, and the community all Monforton students now have a safe playground at their school. The efforts of these fine young people have not gone unnoticed. The Corporation for National and Community Service honored the students and their teacher, Sally Broughton, with the 2008 Spirit of Service Award, and We the People: Project Citizen presented them with the Montana Project Citizen Award for their contributions to the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This spirit of service is prevalent at Monforton School as all students participate in service-learning projects. Classroom lessons are combined with meaningful service to their community. Through these efforts students have been responsible for improving the food service at the school, constructing a walking path, and informing the larger community about the need for a new jail and a warning system for Hyalite Dam among other projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to join the chorus recognizing the seventh grade students of Monforton and their teacher, Sally Broughton. They are a perfect example of how Montana's world-class education system is preparing children across Big Sky country to meet the challenges they will face. These outstanding young people are the future of  our Nation, and I am sure that they will continue to serve and make many contributions to their communities.</paragraph>
