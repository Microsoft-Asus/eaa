    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Saturday, March 15, the Jeannette High School basketball team from my district won the State's Class AA championship. The Jeannette Jayhawks became the second high school in all of Pennsylvania history to reach the achievement of winning both the state basketball and state football championships. Led by players Terrelle Pryor, Shaw Sunder, and Jordan Hall, and Coach Jim Nesser, the Jayhawks won a game that will go down as one of the best in PIAA  history and cap a remarkable season in which the team went 25-4.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a great accomplishment for a small school district in southwestern Pennsylvania which has excelled in the classroom. McKee Elementary was named a Blue Ribbon school, and all the district's schools received the Keystone Achievement Recognition this year, with the school district getting the bronze medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to the entire Jeannette school district and to the entire Jeannette community.</paragraph>
