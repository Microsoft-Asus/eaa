    <paragraph>Mr. President. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a dedication ceremony occurring on September 28, 2007, in Little Rock, AR. The Richard Sheppard Arnold U.S. Courthouse, located at 500 West Capitol Avenue, is named after one of Arkansas's rarest of men. Judge Arnold intertwined great skill in law with unmatched integrity and character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The late Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., once described his former law clerk as "one of the most gifted members of the federal judiciary." Other colleagues point to Judge Arnold as a lifetime teacher, master of the written word, and a model of humility. In his obituary, which he wrote, Judge Arnold said that he thought if he left a mark on the world at all, it would be in his written opinions. However, he concluded that his administrative assignments were his most significant  achievements. His legal career began at Yale College, where he earned a bachelor's degree summa cum laude in 1957 followed by graduation magna  cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1960.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately out of law school, he served as a law clerk to Justice Brennan before joining the Washington, DC, office of Covington &amp; Burling, also serving as a part-time instructor at the University of Virginia Law School. In 1964, he returned to Texarkana, AR, as a partner at Arnold &amp; Arnold. During this time, he also began working as a legislative secretary to Governor Dale Bumpers and later moved to Washington, DC, when Bumpers was elected U.S. Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Arnold's reputation for judicial brilliance and impeccable civility advanced while he served as the U.S. District Judge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas. He was confirmed again in 1980 when President Carter nominated him to a new seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Judge Arnold served as chief judge from 1992 to 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his work on the bench, Judge Arnold's service and leadership extended into countless civic, political, and educational projects. He was the recipient of numerous awards, most notably the 1996 Environmental Law Institute Award, Award for Service to Women in the Law from the St. Louis Women Lawyers Association in 1998, the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award in 1999, and the Meador-Rosenberg Award for the Standing Committee on Federal Judicial Improvements of  the American Bar Association in 1999. He also received honorary doctor of law degrees from the University of Arkansas, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, and the University of Richmond. He is also the author of many legal articles in many of the Nation's most respected law reviews and journals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Law Institute cites Judge Arnold's accomplishments as "remarkable by any measure" and then adds "they neither capture nor define the quality and spirit of the man who achieved them." The same is true for this courthouse. It cannot fully honor Judge Arnold for his contributions to society, but it does serve as a standing and strong reminder of an extraordinary Judge and the justice he pursued in and out of the courtroom.</paragraph>
