  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Good morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends on the Republican side of the aisle are complaining about gas prices, but with two oil men in the White House, is it any wonder that the price per barrel has gone from $30 at the beginning of the Bush administration to $150 or thereabouts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans have taken the tack that we should drill, drill, drill. That's not the answer. We're not going to drill our way out of this problem. I would say it's the three P's: produce from the 68 million acres that we have under lease and are permitted today, punish the people who have been hoarding, gouging, and speculating in oil futures, and the third is promote efficiency and alternative forms of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've learned this lesson too many times. We need to come up with a new way to power this nation. If we do these three P's, produce from what we've got, punish those people who are gouging us, and third, promote energy efficiency and alternative energy, we will change the direction of this nation. And we need to do it right now.</paragraph>
