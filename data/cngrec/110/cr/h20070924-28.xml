    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to encourage passage of <bill type="s" number="1983">S. 1983</bill>, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act. This reauthorization will ensure continued, stable EPA funding for pesticide registration programs, provide predictable timelines for industry, and support the introduction of new and safer products for consumers that are better for the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation received extensive input and strong support from a unique alliance of the pesticides industry and the environmental community. <bill type="s" number="1983">S. 1983</bill> builds on the success of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 and deserves to be passed with the unanimous consent of this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are a few points I would like to clarify regarding the text of this legislation. Regarding section 5, the summaries of acute toxicity studies shall be based on real data to further protect public health and the environment, and acute toxicity studies shall be conducted in a manner which accomplishes that goal. The summaries of the acute toxicity studies are intended to supplement the full submission of data from the registrants, not to replace that data. Registrants must still  provide a full submission of acute toxicity data in their registration application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are three errors in the chart printed in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record of July 31, 2007: The registration service fee for new category No. 133 should be $78,750, rather than $278,250; the decision time for new category No. 47 in fiscal year 3 should be 12 months; and the action description for the new category No. 61 should read: "Non-food use; outdoor; FIFRA, subsection 2(mm) uses (1)."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, section 3 of <bill type="s" number="1983">S. 1983</bill> amends FIFRA to add, among other provisions, a new section that is intended to reflect EPA's current practice of identifying in the docket any information claimed, but not necessarily substantiated, as confidential business information. The language in this new section is not intended to change EPA's responsibilities or practices, pursuant to other statutes, regarding the docketing of information claimed as confidential under FIFRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation, EPA will continue to have the resources to review each pesticide product using the best scientific practices in a more predictable timeframe. The pesticide registration program is a model of good government because it includes systemized  stakeholder involvement and furthers the openness and transparency for which all Federal Government programs should strive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume and rise in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us represents the efforts of several constituent organizations working with the administration and the Congress to reach consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the organizations who worked to produce this proposal were the Natural Resources Defense Council, Crop Life America and the Consumer Specialty Products Association. I appreciate their hard work and their willingness to set aside past differences to develop a fair and balanced funding mechanism for the EPA pesticide registration program that satisfies the needs of government, industry and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chairman Cardoza pointed out, this legislation renews the successful program established in 2004 to fund the pesticide registration program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original legislation had many successes including providing stable funding for the EPA, predictable timelines for industry, new products for consumers, and the necessary funding for the EPA to complete the tolerance reassessment process mandated by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. While the 2004 legislation doesn't expire until next year, the realities of Federal budgetary pressure and the resulting uncertainty regarding the adequacy of appropriations make immediate action on this  reauthorization legislation critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="1983">S. 1983</bill> reauthorizes the existing pesticide registration program with several enhancements aimed toward clarifying what is covered and which activities the fees can be used to support, while protecting funding for certain environmental grant programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to commend the groups whose efforts were instrumental in producing this legislation. I also want to commend Chairman Peterson and Subcommittee Chairman Cardoza and urge all Members to join us in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further Members who seek time on my side. I just wish to also thank my colleague from Virginia for his cooperation on working together with us to extend this program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="1983">S. 1983</bill>, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act, and encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, with the collaboration of agriculture, pesticide manufacturers and public interest organizations, Congress established a new fee schedule and registration process timeline for the Environmental Protection Agency, This Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA) was designed to improve pesticide registration and review, and PRIA has been extremely successful for all parties involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Ranking Member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture, which has jurisdiction over pesticide issues, I am pleased the stakeholders have again worked with Congress and the EPA This bill today continues and builds upon the successful pesticide registration process over the next five years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before PRIA, applicants for pesticide registration had no certainty on how long the review process at EPA would take or how much they would need to pay in fees. The EPA was under pressure from the public interest community to reassess tolerances for pesticides already registered as required under the Food Quality Protection, Act. As a result, consumers who depend on effective and safe pesticide products were not always able to take advantage of new products. Delays impacted farmers' ability to  access improved plant protection and pest products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PRIA worked because it set a firm fee schedule for pesticide registration applicants, giving the EPA resources needed to do reviews. In return, the EPA was held to specific timelines in its reviews and approvals. PRIA also enabled the EPA to complete tolerance reassessments for products approved in the past through product maintenance fees from manufacturers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By continuing the fees and increasing registration funding, <bill type="s" number="1983">S. 1983</bill> provides the EPA with the resources needed to maintain this successful system. Additionally, the bill continues the periodic review of registered products, requiring the EPA to reassess each product every 15 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pesticide registration and review process must be based on sound science. Success also requires confidence in the regulatory system. This reauthorization and enhancement of PRIA helps ensure that the EPA is using the best science to review applicants. Timelines for reviews bring more transparency to the process, and this transparency gives confidence to pesticide users such as agriculture, manufacturers and the public interest community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support continuation of this successful regulatory process that has brought effective and safe products to market not only for agriculture but for all consumers.</paragraph>
