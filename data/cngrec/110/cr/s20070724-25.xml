  <narrative>EDUCATION AND THE MINIMUM WAGE -- (Senate - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9824">S9824</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, during the last year I have listened to a lot of things Ohioans have said, have told me, as I have traveled from Cleveland to Portsmouth, and from Toledo to Cincinnati and from Youngstown to Lima and Bryan. I have heard repeatedly, particularly middle class and working families talk about lost opportunity, that they do not have the same opportunity for wage increases, do not have the same opportunity to join a union, do not have the same opportunity to send their kids  to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier today, we passed legislation--overwhelmingly, bipartisanly--finally, to raise Pell grants to increase the opportunity for young people to go to school. Pell grants had not been increased in years and years and years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know for students in Ohio, for example, the cost of a public education at a 4-year public school has gone up, in the last 5 years, 53 percent. The cost of a private education at a 4-year private school has gone up 28 percent. Yet the average wage in Ohio only went up 3 percent. So we have private education going up this much, public education going up this much, and wages increasing only slightly. That is why the legislation the Senate passed earlier and legislation the House is working on  absolutely will matter to provide opportunity for middle-class kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, as I traveled the State, I heard people talk about tax policy. It is clear to people in Akron, in Youngstown, it is clear to people in Dayton and Middletown, and Hamilton and Gallipolis and Galion, OH, that too often the wealthy have paid, as their income goes up and up and up, very little in taxes, relatively, while middle-class families get more and more of a burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw, from 1946 to 1973, in the history of this country, economic opportunities for poor families and working families grew. Then, from 1973 to 2000, we saw it pretty much level out. We have seen those families who are working hard, playing by the rules, not even enjoying increases at all in their wages. In fact, they have fallen behind in too many cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why today, in addition to passing the bill providing opportunity for students to go to Ohio State or Hiram College or the University of Toledo or the University of Steubenville, students in Ohio have more opportunity--after this bill becomes law, if we can get the President to sign it--than they had yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is also a cause to celebrate. Today the minimum wage goes into effect. It is the first raise in 10 years. For 300,000 working Ohioans, 13 million workers nationwide, they will see their wages go up today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 10 years, worker productivity has gone up. In this country, more productive workers meant higher income workers. But too often we have seen a disconnect between productivity and wages. While American workers are continually more productive, their wages have not gone up. Whether that is a minimum wage worker, whether it is a worker making $20 an hour, it is way too common.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we did something about it for those minimum wage workers. Because of workers in this country--minimum wage and higher income workers--because of what they did last November, voting for change, minimum wage workers have the increase in the pay they deserve and have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a good day for American workers. It is especially a good day for minimum wage workers. We have lots more work to do.</paragraph>
