  <narrative>IN RECOGNITION OF JAMES T. BATES -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11909]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge an extraordinary staff member who has moved on after 20 years with the House Budget Committee, Jim Bates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James T. Bates, the Committee's Republican chief of staff, recently accepted a position as associate program director at the Office of Management and Budget. Ordinarily, that would be a significant, though not surprising, step in a career dedicated to Washington fiscal policy. But there is nothing ordinary about this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Bates's two decades of service represents the longest tenure of any Budget Committee staffer. He served in various capacities during this time, including those of minority counsel, chief majority counsel and deputy chief of staff before rising to the top slot in late 2004. In each of those roles he demonstrated a singular dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came to be known as a true believer in the value of congressional budgeting; a stickler for adhering to the budget disciplines written in law and in convention; and a thoroughly convinced proponent of the institution of the Budget Committee. He is as closely identified with the committee as is the Congressional Budget Act itself. It is nearly impossible to think of one without the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you can't go back over the last 20 years and look at the enforcement of the Budget Committee, the preservation of the Budget Act, without thinking of Jim Bates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim started with the committee in January of 1988, a time when the Republican minority offices were across Highway 395, on the second floor of the Ford Office Building, then simply called Annex Two. He worked initially as a budget analyst, covering Income and Social Security, but before long he found his real niche as committee counsel. Here, he mastered the intricate details and subtleties of the Budget Act; he vigorously protected the committee's jurisdiction, and, when possible, expanded it.  He also developed a unique understanding of budget arcana, something I can clearly testify to, such as the Gramm-Rudman baseline or the pay-as-you-go rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are some highlights of his congressional career: he participated in the famous Andrews Air Force Base negotiations that produced the budget agreement of 1990. In 1993, he coordinated drafting the narrowly defeated Penny-Kasich amendment. In 1997, he anchored the legislative language for the Balanced Budget Act, which a year later produced the first budget surplus in nearly four decades. Shortly thereafter, he developed a bipartisan plan for the first comprehensive budget process reform since  the Budget Act was created in 1974.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, he oversaw the staff work that led to that year's Deficit Reduction Act, the first in a long time. In 2006, he was immensely helpful to me in writing the Legislative Line Item Veto Act, designed to allow the President to strike individual spending items without violating Congress's constitutional prerogatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim is an avid fisherman, which shows a greatness of soul. He is a fan of the renowned author Ray Bradbury, which reflects a creative mind. He might misplace his car keys or his BlackBerry, but he has never lost his conviction about budgeting, or his integrity. Yet, of all Jim's qualities, perhaps the most important is the trust that he has earned from Members and colleagues alike. It is because of that trust that when I was chosen to be the Budget Committee's ranking Republican last December,  my first and easiest decision was keeping Jim as the chief of staff. He was and still is simply irreplaceable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me close simply by saying that there aren't a lot of people in this town who really understand how the Budget Committee works, how this budget process works, let alone people who really know the best ideas and ways of making it work better. Jim Bates is one of the handful of people in this town who knows this. You can count the people on one hand who really know the Budget Act, know how to make it work and know how to make it work better. Jim Bates is one of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This institution, this Congress, both from the Democrat side and the Republican side, owe a large debt of gratitude for the service of this fine servant, Jim Bates.</paragraph>
