    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I visited Walter Reed Army Medical Center, including outpatient residence Building 18.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite Walter Reed's status on the BRAC list, there is no excuse for offering anything but world-class patient care to our returning wounded warriors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the BRAC Commission, Bethesda Naval Medical will take on the important mission currently handled by Walter Reed in 2011. Yet, only 5 weeks ago, the majority decided to take away $3 billion from the BRAC account that is needed to allow them to build the facilities to take on this overwhelming responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have asked the question then, and 5 weeks later have yet to have an answer, where is the money for BRAC and when will the money be restored for patient care for our men and women returning from battle?</paragraph>
