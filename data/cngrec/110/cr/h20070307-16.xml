    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a few minutes ago we heard King Abdullah of Jordan declare the imperative of peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians as central to assuring peace not only in the Middle East but throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking not only of Israelis and Palestinians but of Lebanese and Iraqis and of people all over the world, King Abdullah said, "Let them have a life of peace."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, it is our responsibility as leaders of the United States to respond to such an eloquent call by creating a restart of the peace process, which brings security, justice and peace to both Palestinians and Israelis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our brothers and sisters are killing each other, it is for us to use the power of compassion and love so that all may survive and prosper in security and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good moment for us to make a restart. This is a good moment for us to create a new context. This is a good moment for us to join with King Abdullah in speaking of people in the Middle East and throughout the world and saying, "Let them have a life of peace."</paragraph>
