  <narrative>THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT -- (Senate - March 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1701">S1701</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the afternoon of December 4, 2007, 30-year-old Gilbert Aguilar was walking to a friend's house in Yucaipa, CA, when he was accosted by four Caucasian men. According to a witness, one of the men called Aguilar a racial slur, and after a brief exchange of words Aguilar continued on his way. Later that night, Aguilar and two friends, Joshua Morales and Ryan Couture, passed by the area where the confrontation had taken place. The four were still there waiting for Aguilar. According to a witness,  one of the men in Aguilar's group threw a punch at one of the Caucasian men, provoking Christopher Fulmer to pull out a gun. A witness says Fulmer fired two or three rounds, hitting Couture in the arm and fatally wounding Morales. Fulmer, who has a swastika tattooed on his chest, will stand trial on counts of murder, attempted murder, and a hate crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
