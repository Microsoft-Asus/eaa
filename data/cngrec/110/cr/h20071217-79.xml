  <narrative>FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H15729]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the recognition, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here this evening to speak with our colleagues and certainly to have a conversation with the American people about what has transpired on the floor of this House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know most families are beginning to look toward the Christmas season, and they are looking toward a winter holiday and spending time with family and with friends. And many of them have worked diligently to meet their deadlines to be certain that they have time set aside for such an observance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say that the leadership of the House has worked that diligently and is focused on meeting those deadlines so that we would all be spending that time with our families. But indeed, we have found that is not the case. In unusual moves and through an unusual process, we are still at work, because we find that a budget has not been passed that should have been done before the 1st of September but didn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, what happens with this the process when you don't get your work done, when you don't meet your deadlines, when you disregard what you are charged to do and the duty that you are to fulfill? You find that you get backed into a corner. And, Mr. Speaker, when that happens, then you have to start working your way out of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, in the House of Representatives, when we are backed in that corner and we are unable to fulfill our work in a timely manner, instead of passing our appropriations bills and funding our government one bill at a time, we decide we are going to roll it all together, and then we have what is called the omnibus. And it is a great big spending bill, a great big spending bill, Mr. Speaker, where you throw everything into this that your heart could possibly desire. It is better than any Santa sack  in town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to be certain that everyone realizes this big bill, this 3,565 pages of bill that weighs 34.4 pounds is indeed a Santa's sack loaded with pork and with earmarks, over 9,200 earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, I think that it is fair to say that this also is a symbol. It is a symbol of the broken process that this House has gone through in arriving at a budget. It is a symbol of the broken priorities that exist. And, indeed, it is a symbol of the broken promises of the leadership of this House to not only the body of the House but the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have some colleagues joining me tonight to talk a little bit about what we find in this 34.4 pounds, 3,565 pages. And, Mr. Speaker, I know we are going to talk about energy and the environment. I am saddened to know that we have had a lot of trees give their life to print these bills this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin, for some remarks on this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we take a look at this bill that just passed the House not 20 minutes ago, I think it is important to know what is in this piece of legislation. This piece of legislation weighs about the same amount of weight as my 4-year-old son does. This piece of legislation is 3,565 pages. It is 9,200-plus earmarks, 300 of which we just found out about today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill costs $515 billion. This bill does a lot for a lot of Federal workers in the holiday season. It makes sure that all those Federal workers working at all the different government agencies have their budget for the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what this bill does not do going into this holiday season, it does not give those soldiers in Iraq fighting for our freedom on the frontline of the war on terror, it does not give them one penny. It does not give them 1 minute's worth of comfort so that they have the resources, the tools, the body armor, the bullets, the gasoline, the rations, the support that they need to keep us safe and to fulfill our mission in fighting the war on terror where the epicenter is in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It is a shame that we spend all of this time putting all of this money, all of this pork for all of these government agencies, making sure that bureaucrats here in Washington are comforted during this Christmas season, but not a penny to support our troops in harm's way in Iraq. That is a shame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is also a shame is this bill was dropped on the table today and passed today. Not a single Member of Congress read this entire bill; yet it passed and is on its way to becoming law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also a shame that it is putting our Nation on a dangerous fiscal path. It is the beginning of the week, and we are going to put 10,000 earmarks into law. At the end of the week, we will pass more legislation that will cost billions more. I am worried we may not actually patch the AMT because the majority here is insisting on having permanent tax increases to pay for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while we have already seen the delay in Congress is costing people a 2-month delay in their refund checks from the IRS, if this Congress keeps on the track they are on, they will raise taxes on millions of Americans and businesses just to try to provide for a temporary prevention of a tax increase on 19 million additional taxpayers, 19 million taxpayers who already, because of this delay, will see a delay in their refunds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is not a good moment for the fiscal policy of our country. This is not a proud day for the House of Representatives to thump a 34-pound, 3,565-page bill on the desk and vote it out. But worst of all, it is not a good day for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who are in the fight, who are on the front lines, who want our support, who deserve our support. That should have been taken care of before any single Member of Congress got their pork. Unfortunately, it wasn't,  and that is what passed the House here this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see we are joined by several other colleagues who want to make comments on this. We have leaders here in the House of Representatives on fiscal conservatism, on fiscal responsibility, and I thank the gentlewoman who is controlling the time and thank her for her tireless leadership.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for coming and speaking. We are members of the Republican Study Committee. If you want to find out a little more about what is in this bill, you can go to our Web site, which is House.gov/hensarling/RSC, and find out a little bit about the details in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Wisconsin pointed out, this is serious business. We are responsible for the budget process of the House. The House holds the purse strings for the Federal Government; and it is a duty that we, many of us, take very, very seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is of tremendous concern to us when a bill is filed at 12:30 a.m., the dark of night, this bill gets filed and within 24 hours this 3,565-page bill is voted out. And as the gentleman said, there is no funding for our troops on the ground in Iraq who have been making steady, consistent progress. What a disservice to the troops and to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), who is chairman of the Republican Study Committee. His Web site, House.gov/hensarling/RSC, that is where you can get a copy of what is in this bill; the $515 billion that is contained in here, plus you can find out where some of those gimmicks, budget gimmicks are; plus, you can take a look at some of the emergency/nonemergency spending that is also in here just so that the majority can spend a little bit more money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas who chairs the Republican Study Committee, Mr. Hensarling.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. And, again, I thank her for her leadership in this institution, a very clear, concise, conservative voice on this House floor, particularly when it comes to trying to save the family budget from the onslaught of the Federal budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague from Tennessee has pointed out, the House is completely broken. It is completely broken and felled under this new Democratic leadership. They said they would do better if they were in charge. So what do they bring us today? Today they bring us a 3,565-page spending bill which people have been able to see beside my colleague's speaking position over here, weighing in at 34.4 pounds, roughly the weight of my 5-year-old daughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It spends $515 billion of the people's money, and the Democrat majority brought it to the floor tonight and devoted less than 1 hour of floor time debating this omnibus bill. This body spent about a minute debating every $9.1 billion being spent in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that is money if left in the hands of the families of America and the small businesses of America, who make the jobs and have to work hard to send their kids to college and put food on the table and put roofs over their heads, that money is coming from them; and we spent less than a minute debating $9 billion. The minutes went by, and all of a sudden this House passed a $515 billion bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, when the Republicans were in charge, unfortunately, my party occasionally brought an omnibus bill to the floor, and I personally voted against each and every one because I don't believe that was the vision of the Founding Fathers. It is not the way we should run this government. In fact, I was at a town hall meeting in my district not too long ago and a gentleman from the Athens, Texas, in the 5th Congressional District of Texas, said: Don't you think we would have a much better  government if Members of Congress were actually required to read the legislation before they vote on it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What human being can read 34.4 pounds, 3,565 pages in one day? That is right, Mr. Speaker, this bill was just given to us today. In the early morning hours, this bill was laid upon this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there is no transparency here. It is interesting to me that when the majority party was in the minority, they screamed to the rafters about this process. Listen to what Speaker Pelosi, then minority Pelosi had to say about this process: "The Republican leadership forced through a so-called `martial law' rule that required a same-day vote preventing Members of Congress from having enough time to read legislation. They spent hundreds of billions of dollars and it was thousands  of pages long. This arrogance of power is part of a pattern of abuse."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that is what Speaker Pelosi said 3 years ago when she was in the minority. Now that she is the Speaker, does this mean she is imposing martial law on this House with this process that she decried 3 years ago? Is she now bringing a spirit of arrogance to this institution which she decried 3 years ago? Is she part of the pattern of abuse that she decried 3 years by forcing Members of this institution to vote on this monstrosity?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on process alone, this bill ought to be rejected. But it really ought to be rejected because it puts us on a path of extreme fiscal irresponsibility. Already today this government is on automatic pilot to force the largest single tax increase in American history on working families all across America. It was included in the Democrat budget. More spending fosters more taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the start, Mr. Speaker, because after imposing the single largest tax increase in American history in the Democrat budget, with their so-called "mother of all tax increases," they are going to once again make history by imposing the single largest tax increase in American history yet again, perhaps twice in a 12-month period. I am sure that will break some kind of record here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But don't take my word for it. Listen to the head of the Congressional Budget Office, the head of the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Reserve chairman. They are all going to tell you the same thing, Mr. Speaker, and that is without changing the spending patterns of the Federal Government of which this omnibus represents some of the worst, we are on automatic pilot to double taxes on the next generation. Double. And the average American family pays roughly $22,000 a year in taxes.  That will go to $44,000. How many American dreams are going to be squashed by a tax burden of that magnitude, represented by that 34.4 pound omnibus spending legislation which will flatten the American taxpayer like a bus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is full of gimmicks from people who said they were going to bring the most honest and ethical Congress in the history of mankind to this institution. They take a rubber stamp and they stamp "emergency spending" on anything that moves because they have this little clever device that allows them to avoid any kind of budget discipline when they do that. They have this gimmick called "advanced appropriations" that would make an Enron accountant blush, but they use it to once again evade any  spending discipline whatsoever in this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said they would clean up earmarks and this is chock full of earmarks. Mr. Speaker, if you look closely, maybe some of these earmarks pass the legal test. Maybe they even pass some ethical test, but all too often the American people are seeing campaign cash going into the institution on this end, and they are seeing earmarks coming out the other end. It doesn't meet the fiscal responsibility test, and it doesn't meet the American taxpayer smell test. And that bill is chock full of it. Out  of 3,565 pages, 692 pages are devoted to individual congressional earmarks, which many of the American people believe serve no other purposes other than to get Members of Congress reelected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the Democrat majority said they would clean it up and there would be transparency and accountability. We haven't even had time to read the 692 pages. We don't know what is in there. Maybe there is another museum to a Member of Congress, as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee managed to earmark $2 million to create a museum to himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final point before turning this over to some of my other able colleagues from the Republican Study Committee. I want to harken back to a point made by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), ranking member of the Budget Committee. Earlier tonight the Democrat majority leader came to the floor and said, We have a responsibility to fund our government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I don't know everything that is in that bill, Mr. Speaker, but I know something that isn't in that bill. There is no funding for the men and women fighting for freedom in Iraq. Not one penny. Now how do you have a bill that ostensibly funds the United States Government and somehow you leave out the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform? They wear our Nation's uniform. They come from the small towns and factories and fields from all over America. Their paychecks come from the same  United States Treasury that Members of Congress' do. Somehow the Democrat majority managed to put into their 34-pound bill thousands of earmarks. They managed to fund every single bureaucrat at the Commerce Department, but they can't find one penny for our brave men and women fighting on the front lines of freedom in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, maybe they don't believe in the cause, but don't they believe in the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There is no way that any Member with any credibility can come to this floor and say we are presenting a bill to fund the Federal Government but, oh, we don't really consider members of our armed services fighting in Iraq to be members of our government. I just don't know what planet some of these people come from, Mr. Speaker, and that's just shameful. It is a shameful moment this year in the history of the House to present this spending abomination, chock full of earmarks that ignore our men  and women in harm's way in Iraq. And it's one of the lowest points of this entire year for this Democrat Congress. And I hope that the American people are paying very special attention to what is going on here tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentlelady, again, for her leadership for taking the time to help elaborate on really this heinous piece of legislation that came to the floor earlier, and I want to thank her. And I want to thank all the members of the House Conservative Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus in the House, for always being ready and vigilant to fight for freedom and to work for less government and more freedom and more opportunity, and that's what the Republican Study Committee  is all about. And I appreciate the opportunity to share in this Special Order, and I yield back to the gentlelady from Tennessee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Texas. And again, Mr. Speaker, if someone would like to pull down the summary and get the information on this bill, house.gov/Hensarling, H-E-N-S-A-R-L-I-N-G, /RSC, and they can pull down our summary here. <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill> is the omnibus. Not a minibus. It is a great big omnibus, all 3,565 pages, and they can see for themselves a little bit about what is contained in here and what is not contained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as the gentleman from Texas said, the fact that we are a Nation at war and we have men and women in the field in Iraq who are fighting for our freedom, fighting for our ability to be here and to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, fighting for our security so that we can safely and peacefully celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, and we do not honor their service by funding that work. It is a serious error. It is a serious omission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg), who has been chairman of the RSC in times past. He serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee. He is one of the leading fiscal conservatives in this body, and I yield to him for his comments on the omnibus.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from Tennessee for yielding, and I want to commend her for her work. You know, there is a story here tonight. There's a story the Nation needs to know. There's a story of an institution charged with protecting this Nation and carrying out the responsibilities of this government, and it is a story of shame. It is a story of failure. It is a story of an institution that's supposed to be doing its job and isn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I commend the gentlelady from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for her efforts to bring that story forward, to point out the 3,565-page bill that was laid on us less than 20 hours ago when we were given less than 20 hours to pass it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the real story here, I would suggest, is a story that some of my colleagues have already commented on, and that is the story of 9,200 earmarks in this bill. Now, I suppose if you're an average American you're sitting back at home and you flip through the TV channel and you catch C-SPAN and you know generally what an earmark is. But let me tell you what it is. An earmark is an effort by a Member of Congress to name some little project that will somehow benefit, or they can make an argument  that it will benefit, them or their constituents in some way, and yet, sadly, when you examine those earmarks, you find one thing is true. Every single one of them is self-serving, designed to get that Member of Congress re-elected, and every single one of them is put in there with huge effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in this bill, we have 9,200 individual Member projects, earmarks, if you will, inserted in the bill. You heard my colleague, Mr. Ryan from Wisconsin, point out that 300 of those Member projects or earmarks were dropped in this bill just last night. That is to say, they've never been seen before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my colleague from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, pointed out that none of us could do what I was asked to do when I ran in 1994. When I ran for the United States Congress in 1994, my constituents said to me, Congressman, we want you to go back there and promise us you'll never vote for a bill that you haven't read. Ladies and gentlemen, no one can read a 3,565-page bill in 20 hours. It can't done be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a conservation with a constituent this weekend when I was home, and he said to me, because I was complaining to him about earmarks, about misspending, he said, Well, I thought that the Democrats cleaned that up. I thought that practice ended. I thought they'd ended that. I thought the reforms had changed that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the gentlelady from Tennessee and the gentleman from Texas and my colleague from Wisconsin have pointed out the story of the night. The story of the night is all the talk about reform was just that; it was talk. Reform has not happened. If the American people believe that they elected a new majority to this Congress to end wasteful spending, it didn't happen. If they believe they elected a new majority to Congress to get things done in regular order so we could review the bills and read  them before they were voted on, it did not happen. If the people across America believe they elected a new majority, and that new majority reformed the rules to end earmark abuse, it didn't happen, because those earmarks are here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hillary Clinton's hippie museum, it's here. And God knows what else is in this bill, because the 3,565 pages which sit right there cannot possibly have been combed by all of us in this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What you have heard is that while Congress could find time to put in 9,200 earmarks in this bill, and combined with prior bills, take the total earmarks for the year to 10,300, roughly, roughly $17.6 billion in Member projects and earmarks, we could find the time to do that. All the Members of Congress could, you know, write out their list requests and say, I need this project and I need that project and I need this project, and Hillary Clinton needs a hippie museum, and God knows what  else is in this bill. But we couldn't find time, as my colleagues from Texas and Tennessee and Wisconsin have pointed out to you, we couldn't find time to put money in there for our soldiers in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh, we could find time to renovate the U.N.'s headquarters in New York. We could find time to essentially overturn the Secure Fence Act by making it almost impossible to build that fence. We could find time to craft 692 pages of individual Member requests, little requests, fund this so that I look good and I get re-elected. We could find time for that. We could find time for 9,200 of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could air-drop, that's right, you heard, air-drop earmarks. What does that term mean? Well, an air-drop earmark is an earmark that is inserted in a bill after it has left both the House and the Senate. How many of those are there in this bill that nobody's ever seen, perhaps, but the author of the bill? There are 300 of those. So we could find time for 9,200 earmarks, 300 of them air-dropped, never seen before. No American, no average American back home has had any chance to review them. We could find time for that, but we could not find time to fund the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the gentlelady for bringing these facts forward. I think it is a story that America needs to know. They need to know that this Congress, as the gentlelady from Tennessee pointed out, was supposed to do this work clear back last August, last September, and be done with it. But they couldn't find time to do it until now, almost Christmas Eve. But by gosh, they could find time for their earmarks, their pet projects. But no time for the Nation's defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the gentlelady from Tennessee. I appreciate her yielding me time. I think this is a story the American people know about, need to know about, and I think it's worth saying here one more time. My friend Tom Cole from Oklahoma said, "Earmarks are a gateway drug to higher spending. I suggest this bill proves that to be true. Once again, earmarks pave the way for higher spending. And as my colleague from Texas pointed out, that means higher taxes, less money in the pocketbooks  and wallets of the American people, more money in the hands of the government to, frankly, misspend in ways to try to get themselves re-elected. I think it's an important story. I think it's a sad day, and I commend the gentlelady for asking the time, late at night to take her time and to</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman and I thank him for his comments on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think that it is just one of these occurrences that has happened tonight that you just find almost inconceivable, that the majority could have filed a 3,565-page bill in the middle of the night and then bring everybody back to Washington and vote it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as the gentleman from Arizona said, the fiscal year started September 1. This is something that should have been done last summer. But, instead, they wait until Christmas week. They file this bill in the middle of the night. They don't give people time to read it. And then, as we do begin to read it, we find what we thought at first was going to be about 7,000 earmarks, read a little more, the number is growing to 8,000. Then, Mr. Speaker, lo and behold, we get up to 9,000. Then it goes  to over 9,200. We find that 300 of those earmarks had not been discussed by anybody. They just appeared out of thin air, like magic. They just appeared and got written in to this bill that passed the House tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not fiscal responsibility. That, Mr. Speaker, is what you call fiscal irresponsibility. It is the symbol of a broken process, with broken priorities, and it is broken promises. That is something that is very troubling to us as we are here this Christmas week hard at work defending the American taxpayer. And the American taxpayer has no better individual standing to defend them than the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. Westmoreland has worked with and chairs the Floor Action Team for  us in the minority and does a wonderful job in that capacity. He is an active member and a part of the leadership of the Republican Study Committee. And I yield to him for his comments on the legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the lady from Tennessee for her leadership in this and for her taking this late hour to come and be part of a group, the Republican Study Committee, that believes in fiscal conservatism, and are willing to stand up and fight, to be called names in this body. In fact, I think the lady and myself and others that have spoken here tonight have been called the fringe because we stand up and want to debate these issues and want to bring the truth to the American people.  And to the lady from Tennessee, I just, you know, I think that we need to clarify to the people and let them understand what kind of position, not only us, but this whole House was put in today because less than 24 hours ago, at about 12:30 this morning, this bill, over 3,500 pages was filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now, I don't know about the rest of you, and I'm sure the gentlelady from Tennessee, but I was in the bed then, sound asleep, as I'm sure most people were. I got up this morning and got dressed and got on a plane and came to D.C., but the first time this bill was debated and just the rule on this bill was about 5:30 tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So put yourself in this position. Your financial officer for your company comes in and hands you a bill like this and says could you look at this and let me know if this is okay to finance this company for the rest of the year, and I need to know by about 8 o'clock tonight. Now, I think it would be impossible for them to do it. I think it would be impossible for any of us to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's been impossible for us to take 3,500 pages, something that weighs over 34 pounds, and try to consolidate that into information that we can base a vote on. It's impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Talking about $515 billion. Now, when I was in the Georgia legislature, our State budget for 9 million people was a little over $16 billion, and I thought I realized how much $1 billion was but it was not until a friend of mine, Naomi Morgan, sent me an e-mail today, in fact, and pointed out several things to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One billion, if 1 billion were seconds and we went back 1 billion seconds, we would be in 1959. 1959 is 1 billion seconds from right now. And when you're talking about that, we just got through  passing a $515 billion bill in less than 24 hours, that's scary, isn't it? And.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing is 1 billion minutes, if we went back 1 billion minutes from now, Jesus would be walking the earth. Jesus would be walking the earth 1 billion minutes ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes we lose perspective. We've been up here too long when we just throw around the word "billion," but we were asked today to vote in less than 24 hours on a 3,500 page bill, weighs over 35 pounds, and contained $515 billion worth of spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, that shows me that the process is broken, and when the process is broken, the product is flawed. This process has been broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we were lied to or misled. I'd hate to think that they purposely lied, but I think they misled us and the American people, the majority party, on the first day when they talked about a new open process, a new bipartisan spirit. See, I represent about 700,000 people, as every Member in this body does, and those 700,000 people want to have some type of input into the situation, and you know, unfortunately, I've not had any input in this bill. There has not been any amendments to be allowed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could not look at all the 9,000 or so earmarks in this bill to see if they were justified, but I do want to tell the American people, because one of the things other than spending too much of their money has been illegal immigration. Now, that is a high topic, and I want the American people, and I think this is very important because every town hall meeting I have and I don't know about you, every town hall meeting I have, every teleconference I have, the hottest topic that we have is illegal  immigration. Now, this should really at least let the public know the priorities that the majority party has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$10 million in this bill in that 3,500-page bill over there, $10 million of it went for emergency spending for defense attorneys for illegal immigrants. $10 million of that bill goes for defense attorneys in emergency spending for illegal immigrants; yet we did not fund our troops in Iraq one dime.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think that this is such an important part of this bill because we have talked a good bit about our troops in Iraq not being funded in this bill, and then when we talk about the gimmickry, and just I hate to even use the term. It's almost like a sleight of hand.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Smoke and mirrors.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Smoke and mirrors, it is indeed, where they come in and they're going to make it very difficult to build the fence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, they have $2.7 billion for border security funds in the homeland security accounts, and then they have another $225 million for GSA related to the border fence. Then they turn around and there is $10.5 million for defender services for illegal immigrants. And we know that what they've done is to go in and make it very, very difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill releases $650 million of this funding for the border fence only after, and that is where they're setting up roadblock, only after the Appropriations Committee is satisfied with the Department of Homeland Security's expenditure plan and that 15 conditions listed in the bill are met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as the gentleman knows, every time we do a town hall meeting people are so concerned about the loss of this Nation's sovereignty, about the loss of security in our communities. Because the illegal immigration issue is not addressed, every State's a border State, and every town is a border town, and now we see that they're playing tricks. They're going to say, well, we're going to go under emergency money and we're going to put it in here that it could be released if we decided it was an  emergency, and oh, by the way, we're going to release part of it only after the Appropriations Committee is satisfied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, what's satisfied one person's requirements may not satisfy another because it is subjective, and that will be released at that time. And then you have got 15 conditions. Well, you can make it impossible to ever satisfy a list of conditions, Mr. Speaker, if your goal is to block something. If your plan is to fail, you can develop a plan to fail, and that is what we see in this 3,565 pages of a budget document is how to fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield back to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>I was going to say, and trust me, what you were just talking about as far as meeting these requirements, trust me, this $10.5 million that we're spending on these defense attorneys for these illegal immigrants, trust me, they're going to law you up and keep us from building that fence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you know, now when my constituents say, Congressman, why aren't we building that fence, why aren't we securing the border, then I've got something I can tell them now. I can give them that 3,500-page bill, of course there's no telling what it would cost them to get a copy of that, 35 pounds of paper there, and say it's in this bill that we will build the fence but only under certain conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think the gentlelady from Tennessee, or anybody that's had a town hall meeting, would agree that these people do not care about the conditions. The only conditions they want is they want a fence. They want a border. They want a secure country because no country without secure borders is secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so that's what the American people want, not stumbling blocks and not something big enough to hide $10.5 million in for defense attorneys in emergency spending. Now, this is emergency spending for the illegal immigrants. We've got some true emergencies, but it's not in defending them. It's in allowing them to come here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just hope that the American people, that tonight somehow that we have made a difference or maybe had at least some eye opening with some of the information that we've given them about this bill over here that we were asked to vote on today, and I hope that they will understand that this is not an easy process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the process is broken, and I will be honest with you, it was broken when we were in charge, but it's lost another wheel. We may have only been one wheel short when we were in charge, but trust me, both axles are broken right now, and it's just being drug along the ground. It is broken. The product is flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to start over. I would hope that the President would veto this bill. I would hope that he would veto this bill and get us back to the table so we can take some of these things back out, save the taxpayers some money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do appreciate, again, the leadership of the gentlelady from Tennessee and her willingness to come here this late at night and try to explain some of this to the American people so that they can have a better understanding of some of the challenges that we're faced with and some of the opportunities that the majority party is taking with smoke-and-mirror bills like we passed today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and you know, I think it is so important that, once again, I remind individuals at house.gov/hensarling/rsc you can get a little bit of a summary of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, you know, it's one of these things where, Mr. Speaker, we have had it for only a very short period of time because it was less than 24 hours ago that it was even put up on-line for Members to be certain that they had the chance to look at it. I was one of those Members up. I was at home working away, trying to get things finished to get some of my Christmas cooking done and my Christmas ironing done and ready for the holiday season with my family. And I will tell you, it is of such  concern to me that we see the manner in which this has been constructed and pulled together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do hope that the American people will sit down and look through some of this and see where this money is going. My goodness, when you see $11 billion for emergency designated spending and then you see that the budget's criteria for emergency spending is sudden, unforeseen, temporary, urgent, et cetera, and that is where you see some of the gimmickry begin to come in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, these are things that we all agree with. There's money for drought relief, which that's been very difficult, but $20 million for farm service agency salaries and expenses, that should have been something that was anticipated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eight million dollars for Department of Justice administrative review and  appeals; $10 million for legal activities, salaries and expense; $7 million for U.S. attorneys, salaries and expenses; $15 million for U.S. marshals, services, salaries and expenses; $143.5 million for FBI salaries and expenses; $2 million for Drug Enforcement Agency, salaries and expenses; $14.5 million for Court of Appeals, salaries and expenses. Mr. Speaker, salaries and expenses  should be something that was anticipated. I'm not certain that meets the criteria of emergency. Emergency should be something that is unforeseen, that we didn't know was going to happen. Now, if we have people on our payroll and we do expect them to get a paycheck, then that salary and the related expenses and benefits are something that we should be planning for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there's the $10.5 million that the gentleman from Georgia and I have discussed where you set aside the money for illegal immigrants to be able to have attorneys to defend them. And then there's the ruse of the border fence with the money that's being appropriated but then you can't get to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's $300 million for wildfire suppression and $195 million for the Minnesota bridge accident, which occurred many months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And here is $100 million for Presidential security at political conventions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it may be a news flash. This may be totally new to many people, but we have a political convention every 4 years. This is something we should be planning for. It should not be an emergency expense that we are going to have to have Presidential security at the political conventions. Cities go to great lengths to bid to get these conventions, to be able to hold them. We know that every 4 years we are going to have a Presidential election. This is something that is anticipated. It is  not an emergency that is unexpected.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentlewoman yield?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will gladly yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>You just told me something new when you were reading out those salaries in there under emergency spending. So we are paying district attorneys and judges and other people these salaries in emergency spending, but yet we are not funding our troops in Iraq. Is that what you're telling me?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, that is what we have found. That is all a part of the emergency spending component. That's why I think it's so interesting when you go through and read the summary on this bill because you find that in order to carry out the ability to spend a little more on programs where they want to spend more, what they have done is to shift the cost. And so if you can put it under emergency spending and then not have to submit it to the PAYGO rules, then it allows you  to be able to spend a little bit more.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>So this is more smoke and mirrors, is what you're saying?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is more of the smoke and mirrors, and I am sure it was concocted in a smokefilled room. But it just doesn't make good sense, and it's just not common sense in the way it ought to be done when you look at your different allocations and your different lines. And certainly there are many people listening to this who sit on county commissions and city councils and they are in State legislatures and they are listening to this and they are pulling down this budget document and they  are saying, We could never get away with something like this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>The funny thing is if we had corporate officers that were running their companies like that, we would have them in front of the Government Reform Committee and having a hearing on them. It's embarrassing that we are running our government the way we are running it, and yet we are having hearings about these corporate officers that are doing things in the dark of night and in smoke and mirror, phony documents that they're doing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes. Reclaiming my time, the next segment that I have here is after the emergency spending, which I was reading through, then we get into the budget gimmicks, and you see how they have pulled in $10.2 billion in gimmicks that are being used to artificially lower the cost of the bill. And it goes through this with some transportation funds; the crime victims fund; advanced appropriations, which sounds just a little bit sneaky there. It increases some funding for the BRAC account,  and there's a way that's kind of shifted and moved around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then following that we get into each of the individual Departments, each of the appropriations bills, with the Agriculture bill, Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy and Water. We go through each of these and list where some of the provisions are and some of the increases. There is an increase in here for salaries and expenses at the Food and Drug Administration from $1.57 billion to $172 billion. An increase for conservation programs. The Legal Services Corporation, the LSC, it gives $350 million  for them, $1 million over the fiscal year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the Legal Services Corporation is free legal aid. They represent individuals that sue the government. So we are going to increase their funding, but we are not going to fund our troops, and we are not going to get that fence built and secure that border. So in here is increased funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs from $1.47 billion to $1.72 billion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Fuzzy math.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>And there again you see that we are increasing that. We are increasing the Department of the Interior programs, but we are not funding our troops. We see increased funding for the IRS. They are going from $10.60 billion to $10.89 billion, and it is an increase of $295.3 million or 2.8 percent over their fiscal year 2007 numbers. So we are going to increase money for the IRS, but we are not going to get that money to our troops.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentlewoman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will gladly yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't know how your constituents are going to feel about that, but when I go home and tell my constituents that we increased the IRS spending more than the normal 4 percent, or whatever it is, we have increased it double, and yet we didn't want to give any money to our troops in Iraq, they're going to be kind of mad about that. But then when I tell them they put up roadblocks about building the fence and we didn't fund our troops in Iraq, they're going to be upset about that.  And then when I tell them about the $10 million in emergency spending for defense attorneys, I think they are really going to be mad about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the American people get a good grip on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>When I go back and say they were going to increase funding to the IRS and it would be $10.89 billion, my constituents are going to say that's why you need to get rid of the IRS, and that's why we need to have a fair tax.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Absolutely.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>And that is what we will hear from our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the list goes on and on, as you can see. I have got plenty of pages that we could flip through. We even have title X and family planning money that is increased by $300 million. And I find it so very interesting that they go in and they increase the title X and the Family Planning money, but guess what? What they didn't do was to increase the money for the abstinence education program. Now, how about that, Mr. Speaker? That funding was held level. It was held level. And Family Planning and  Planned Parenthood will get big increases, but abstinence education will not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Speaker, as I have said several times tonight, budgets are about priorities. Budget documents tell you where you want your emphasis to be. And what we see from this majority is a budget process that is broken, with priorities that are broken, and promises that are broken. And we have a 3,565-page bill that weighs 34.4 pounds when you print it out. It contains over 9,200 earmarks. There are lots of pet projects, lots of pork in this big Santa sack. What is missing is funding for the  troops on the ground in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it very sad, very sad indeed, that it is the men and women who defend this great Nation who are left out in the cold this Christmastime. They are the ones that should be at the very  top of the list, Mr. Speaker. We should think of them first. We should honor them in the way that we do our jobs. We are a Nation at war. We know that. That is something I think most people in this body agree with. And we pass a budget that does not include them and  does not include the funding to meet their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you and I would not be able to stand in this Chamber and have this debate if it were not for the men and women of the U.S. military. We should honor them. They should have been Title I, Page 1. And instead they are nowhere to be found in 3,565 pages. That is a serious oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, once again, we can talk about all the other things. We can talk about the illegal immigrants being able to get funding for attorneys. We can talk about roadblocks to having the borders secured, things that are purposely placed there; but the most egregious oversight is the fact that it does not fund our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I close, I will say God bless those troops. God bless their families. And, Mr. Speaker, my prayer is that this House will reverse itself and will put them first in this budget document.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
