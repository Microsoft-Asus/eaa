  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO AUGIE HIEBERT -- (Senate - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11649">S11649</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to honor one of Alaska's most admired pioneers and a dear friend of mine and my whole family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaskans will remember Augie Hiebert for his many achievements in the field of broadcasting and for opening the doors to modern communications for all Alaskans. In a State with few roads, where hundreds of miles of wilderness often separate towns and villages, Alaskans rely upon airwaves to connect them with people and events across our State, across the country, and around the globe. Augie was one of the first to bring the benefits of broadcast technology to our last frontier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At an early age, Augie developed a fascination for electronics and radio which would lead him to a career in broadcasting. While growing up on an orchard in Washington State during the Great Depression, Augie built his own first radio. He earned his ham radio license at the age of 15. He was just 22 years old when he came to Fairbanks in 1939 to help a friend build KFAR Radio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the morning of December 7, 1941, Augie was listening to ham radio broadcasts at KFAR's transmitter when he heard of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was one of the first in Alaska to hear the shocking news and immediately alerted the commander of Ladd Field right there in Fairbanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having witnessed firsthand the impact broadcasting had on the lives of those who were living in Alaskan territory, Augie set out to bring the technology of television to what we call our great land. In 1953, Augie built Alaska's first television station, KTVA, bringing news, weather, sports, and entertainment to the people of Anchorage. Two years later, he broadcast the first television shows to Fairbanks when he built KTVF. Augie's TV stations brought history's defining events from around the  globe into Alaska's living rooms. In 1969, Augie gave us the first live satellite broadcasts, and Alaskans from Fairbanks to Anchorage watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Alaska's broadcast industry grew, so did Augie's family. He and his wife Pat raised four daughters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his long career in broadcasting, Augie served Alaska in many ways. He was the founder and president of the Alaska Broadcasters Association. When I was practicing law, I helped him form that association. Every year, Augie brought a group of Alaskan broadcasters to Washington for Alaska Day at the Federal Communications Commission, where he gave them a rare opportunity to speak on a one-to-one basis with commissioners about the unique challenges facing broadcasters in Alaska. But Augie's  efforts to educate the FCC about Alaskan broadcasting didn't end there. He invited them, and the entire FCC at one time traveled to Alaska at his request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 1980s, Augie led the fight to preserve AM broadcast coverage in Alaska, which resulted in the creation of the class of the 1-N FCC category, a category just for our State of Alaska. Over the years, Augie introduced countless Alaskans to broadcasting and gave many their start in the industry. Though he officially retired in 1997, Augie remained committed to the future of broadcasting in Alaska, and until the day of his death, he was talking to me about the problem of white spaces  in the current debate over new digital broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He became a mentor to the students at Mirror Lake Middle School in Chugiak, AK, where he shared his enthusiasm for broadcasting and he helped students produce news programs for the school's closed-circuit television system, and they did that every morning before school started. He showed them how to prepare a morning show for their school. Augie brought leading professionals in the field of broadcasting to Mirror Lake to share their experiences and knowledge with these students. Today, the school  operates a low-powered FM radio station which Augie helped build and license. It is the only class D low-powered radio license in the country issued to a school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than all of the firsts he achieved during his long career, Alaskans will remember Augie most as the man who made the Nation's largest State a little bit smaller. His efforts brought us closer to one another and closer to the rest of the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with Augie's daughters, their families, and all who loved him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This man was a great American, a great Alaskan, and my great friend.</paragraph>
