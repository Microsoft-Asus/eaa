    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very important Federal program that helps hundreds of thousands of Michigan families and millions of Americans across the country. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, is critically important for families and seniors who struggle to pay high energy bills to heat their homes in the winter and cool their homes in the summer. Without LIHEAP, many of these households would be forced to make the impossible choice  between paying for energy or paying for food and medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is the National Fuel Funds Network's Washington Action Day for LIHEAP and folks from many different States will be walking the Halls of Congress to make sure we know how important it is to fully fund LIHEAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As winter kicks into high gear, the importance of the LIHEAP program is even more pronounced. According to the Energy Information Administration, American households spent an average of $948 in 2006 on their winter heating needs--an increase of $250 over the 2000-2001 winter season. That might seem like a modest increase, but for most Americans living paycheck to paycheck, it could have disastrous effects on their household budgets. LIHEAP assistance, which emphasizes partnerships between utilities,  charitable organizations, and State governments, is a highly effective and cost-efficient way for our country to help the neediest families manage these incremental increases in their home energy costs. It has thus become an important component of our social safety net.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not surprisingly, LIHEAP assistance historically has been targeted to cold-weather States in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. In the State of Michigan, for instance, more than 470,000 households received LIHEAP aid in 2006. In recent years, however, the program has been retooled in order to recognize the need to provide similar assistance to warm-weather States in the South and Southwest to help their neediest citizens meet their home cooling needs. Last year, more than 6.2 million households  received assistance nationwide, including many new families in the warm-weather areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the LIHEAP program has never been funded to its authorized level--which recently was raised to $5 billion as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Even though LIHEAP was funded at $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2006 the highest level ever--many who are eligible remain unable to get help because there are simply not enough funds to help them. We need to take a good, hard look at our funding efforts so that we are not forced to make unfair choices between cold and warm-weather States,  much less deny support to eligible recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increased gas prices, unforeseen medical bills, sudden unemployment, or any other unexpected situation that causes a family's living costs to rise while their income stays fixed, forces families to make some truly hard choices. But no one should have to choose between the need to heat and the need to eat. At its foundation, the LIHEAP program helps these families deal with one of the most basic of their needs--a warm home in wintertime as they work to regain their footing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the National Fuel Funds Network has mobilized a coalition of charitable organizations such as the Salvation Army and The Heat And Warmth Fund, THAW, utilities such as CMS Energy and DTE Energy of Michigan,  State government officials, and low-income constituents to meet with congressional offices to educate Congress about the LIHEAP program and make the case for greater funding. I commend the organizers and participants of today's Washington Action  Day for LIHEAP, and I urge my colleagues to support and fully fund the LIHEAP program. By supporting this important program, we are supporting hard-working American families. It is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
