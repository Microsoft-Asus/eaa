    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I celebrate the life of Mary Keating, who, until she passed away last October, was a proud resident of the city and great State of New York for nearly 78 years. Mary first came to America at the young age of 17, far from her home and her family in Derry, Kilshanny, County Clare, Ireland. Not long after she arrived, she met and married Martin Keating, who also hailed from County Clare. She and Martin shared many passions, most notably their love for their family,  their friends, and their deep, abiding faith in God. While neither of them were musicians, they relished the Irish country sets of their native Clare and carried them with them to this country, eventually to meet and dance them on the Rockaway Beach boardwalks, which as far as they were</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Music was not the only way that Mary celebrated her Irish heritage. It also could be found in her love to entertain friends and family. It was well known in their neighborhood and beyond that there was always an extra spot at the dinner table in the Keating home. As Mary would say, "what is one extra potato in the pot?" One could never visit her home without enjoying at least a cup of tea and an assortment of food. Three generations of Keatings grew up savoring her specialties such Irish soda  bread, turnips, and leg of lamb. Much to their chagrin, her daughters and granddaughters have never been able to make a soda bread half as delicious as Mary's, simply because the "recipe" was all done by taste and memory. As her granddaughter Kristin noted, the only one of Mary's dishes her grandchildren will not miss is her "lumpy" mashed potatoes, especially since Martin was a firm believer in the notion that children should finish everything they are served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary will be remembered by all who knew her as a strong and caring woman  who lived a life guided by her faith and values. Long before recycling became the politically correct thing to do, Mary Keating saved and reused every bread bag, rubber band, piece of tinfoil, and jar she ever brought into the house. Old jelly jars were magically transformed into milk glasses and bread bags were used to store everything from school lunch to sea shells from Rockaway  Beach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though Mary has left this world, her legacy will continue through the lives and work of her 8 children, 20 grandchildren, and 24 great-grandchildren. I know this because her granddaughter, Kathleen Keating Strottman, served as my staff for over 7 years and I saw many of these traits in her. In honor of Mary's Irish heritage, I would like to close my remarks with the refrain of an Irish ballad, "The Lovely Rose of Clare":</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh my lovely rose of Clare, you're the sweetest girl I know, You're the queen of all the roses, the pretty flowers that grow, You are the sunshine of my life, so beautiful and fair, And I will always love you, my lovely rose of Clare.</paragraph>
