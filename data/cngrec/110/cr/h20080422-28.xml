  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="981">H. Res. 981</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas glaucoma is a progressive disease of the optic nerve, robbing individuals of both peripheral and central vision;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas glaucoma affects all age groups, including infants, children, and the elderly;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas glaucoma disproportionately affects underserved minority populations, with African-Americans having a three times greater risk of developing this disease than White Americans, and it is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in African-Americans and Hispanics;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas glaucoma is the second leading cause of preventable vision loss in the United States, afflicting 2,200,000 Americans, and it is the leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide, afflicting 67,000,000 persons;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas awareness is absolutely crucial, as glaucoma often has no symptoms until vision loss occurs, and it is estimated that, in the United States, more than half of the individuals with glaucoma are unaware that they have it and, in developing countries, 90 percent of individuals with glaucoma are unaware that they have it;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas with early diagnosis and ongoing treatment, 90 percent of the cases where blindness occurs can be avoided and awareness is crucial, so that individuals with known risk factors for glaucoma and those over the age of 40 should have regular, comprehensive eye examinations that include careful evaluation of the optic nerve and measurement of eye pressure;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the National Eye Institute ("NEI") within the National Institutes of Health ("NIH") has been a worldwide leader in glaucoma research, elucidating the genetic basis of different types of the disease (including risk factors) and the potential for gene therapy approaches, identifying factors that can protect the optic nerve from damage, evaluating the potential for optic nerve cell regeneration, and better understanding how elevated intraocular pressure leads to optic nerve damage and  how pressure-reducing drugs ultimately developed from NEI-led research can reduce glaucoma progression;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas it is the role of the NEI to support research to prevent, diagnose, and cure glaucoma-related vision impairment and blindness, which disproportionately affects underserved minority populations; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the public needs to know the insidious nature of glaucoma, that there are means for detecting and treating it to save sight, and the importance of compliance associated with those treatments, and the first-ever World Glaucoma Day is an observance planned to increase global awareness in that regard: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the United States House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes the first-ever World Glaucoma Day;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) supports the efforts of the National Eye Institute within the National Institutes of Health to continue research on the causes of glaucoma, including genetic and environmental risk factors, glaucoma prevention, the relationships between damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision, societal and individual impacts, diagnostics, and treatment to save and potentially restore sight; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) congratulates the American Glaucoma Society for its efforts to expand awareness of the prevalence and economic burden of glaucoma.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Towns) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="981">H. Res. 981</bill>, recognizing March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I am proud to speak out in favor of greater support for glaucoma awareness and prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glaucoma is the second leading cause of preventable vision loss in the United States and the leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. It afflicts 67 million people by some estimates. While glaucoma affects all age groups, it is of special concern to me because it disproportionately affects underserved minority populations, particularly African Americans over age 40 and Mexican Americans over 60.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution before us supports the observance of World Glaucoma Day, which would raise awareness about glaucoma on a global scale. Awareness is especially important since nearly 90 percent of individuals with glaucoma are unaware that they have it. Moreover, regular comprehensive eye exams can lead to early diagnosis and treatment that can lessen the impact of this devastating disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution also supports the efforts of the National Eye Institute and its commitment to continue research on the causes of glaucoma. By learning more about the causes of this insidious disease, we may one day find a cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution also congratulates the American Glaucoma Society for its efforts to raise awareness about the prevalence of the disease. The American Glaucoma Society helps to preserve vision by supporting glaucoma specialists and scientists through the advancement of education and research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to thank the Friends of the Congressional Glaucoma Caucus Foundation, a nonprofit foundation funded in part by the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, for its outstanding contributions in providing free glaucoma screening for 200,000 people from 2001 to date, while administering the programs that include follow-up and treatment services across the country. Further, I must point out that I am a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="3005">H.R. 3005</bill>, the Glaucoma Screening Act of 2007. This measure was introduced  by Representatives Serrano and Boozman and Mr. Menendez of the Senate. I urge my colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to hold a hearing on this bill soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin, for her leadership on <bill type="hr" number="981">H. Res. 981</bill>, which recognizes March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) will control the time of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to start by thanking my colleague Congresswoman Baldwin for introducing this legislation along with 100-plus additional Members who have signed on as cosponsors to this important resolution. I would also like to praise the extensive grassroots effort made by numerous eye disease and prevention groups to ensure that this bill passes today in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor for me to speak in favor of this legislation today. This bill recognizes March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day. This day was established to increase awareness of glaucoma, which is the second leading cause of preventable blindness in the United States and worldwide. I can speak from personal experience regarding the importance of eye health and getting the appropriate screenings throughout a person's lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that cause progressive damage of the optic nerve at the point where it leaves the eye to carry visual information to the brain. This disease robs individuals of both peripheral and central vision. If left untreated, many types of glaucoma progress towards gradually worsening visual damage and could and may lead to blindness. Once incurred, visual damage is irreversible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated that glaucoma affects 2.2 million Americans and 67 million people worldwide, that 4.5 million people globally are blind due to glaucoma, and that number will rise to 11.2 million by 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are several types of glaucoma. Some may occur as a complication of other visual disorders, but the vast majority occurs without any known cause. Glaucoma affects all age groups, including infants and children. In most cases, however, glaucoma appears later in life, and its frequency increases with age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no cure for glaucoma yet, and vision loss is irreversible. Therefore, early detection is essential to limiting visual impairment and preventing the progression towards severe visual handicap or blindness. With early diagnosis and treatment, 90 percent of cases where blindness occurs can be avoided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from New York just said this important fact: This is a preventable disease. Individuals with numerous factors and those over the age of 40 should have a regular comprehensive eye exam. World Glaucoma Day is one of the many efforts to increase awareness of the importance of eye health. There are several ways to detect and treat glaucoma to save sight, and it is essential that the message reaches every single person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm honored to support this legislation and to work for its passage. But today, Mr. Speaker, we have a message that is there for all Americans and the world to hear, and that is glaucoma is preventable. Awareness is something we should all have and be mindful that we can work towards a cure in the very near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is very important legislation to me. In the early part of my life, I worked for the Industrial Home for the Blind, which is now referred to as the Helen Keller Foundation. I had the opportunity to see and to talk to people, in many instances who were blind because they did not get the attention at an early stage and as a result they lost their vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think what we are doing here today is so important, that we pass this legislation which encourages people to seek treatment, encourages people to get eye exams. I think that is the thing we need to do. Because as my colleague indicated, early detection sometimes can prevent this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that note, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too join my colleague from New York in talking about not only the importance of what we are doing here today, but also to thank the many groups from around the country that have taken time to touch base with their Member of Congress about the importance of not only treatments of glaucoma, but the awareness of glaucoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are on the floor for the first ever opportunity to say we are going to highlight this important effort and battle that we are doing, and we are going to make progress on that. It really comes about through awareness, where people who perhaps are hearing about glaucoma for the first time and understanding about the pressure that is put on the eye that can cause this blindness, but is preventable. I hope that the time that we spend today will find itself in messages to thousands of people  who recognize that their time to come to Washington, DC to tell their story about this, really did matter, and paid off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to notify the gentleman that I do not have any additional speakers, and I will find out if he does. But I would encourage him to run through his speakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>I do not have any additional speakers. I think we have the right to close.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from New York, Mr. Towns, for taking the time to come in a little bit early today to work on behalf of the gentlewoman, Congresswoman Baldwin, on this important effort. She and I joined together on this effort. We joined together and had the support from some 100 other Members of Congress, who have heard the message, who believe that it is important that we have this resolution on the floor today. We are proud that  we have done this. It is a meaningful effort that this entire House of Representatives do this. I will be very proud of what the House does today to pass the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker for allowing this bill to come to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague for the outstanding work that he has done. I also would like to thank Congresswoman Baldwin for her outstanding work as well, who has been detained and not able to get here. But she has worked real hard on this because she understands how important it is in terms of early detection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 981, which recognizes March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day and I wish to thank my colleague, Mr. SESSIONS, for joining me in introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glaucoma is the second leading cause of preventable vision loss in the United States. It is a group of diseases that damages the optic nerve and leads to vision loss. An estimated 2.2 million Americans have glaucoma. An additional 2 million have glaucoma, but do not know it, as glaucoma often has no symptoms until vision loss occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If left untreated, glaucoma leads to blindness, which has occurred in about 120,000 Americans. Worldwide, nearly 70 million people are affected by the disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every American over the age of 60 is at risk of developing glaucoma, which also disproportionately affects minority populations. African Americans have a three times greater risk of developing this disease than white Americans, and it is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in African Americans and Hispanics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With early diagnosis and ongoing treatment, however, 90 percent of the cases where blindness occurs can be avoided. Awareness is crucial, so that individuals with known risk factors for glaucoma and those over the age of 40 should have regular, comprehensive eye examinations that include careful evaluation of the optic nerve and measurement of eye pressure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Mr. Speaker, I am happy today that the House of Representatives is considering this resolution, which seeks to expand global awareness about the incidence and burden of glaucoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize the American Glaucoma Society for its efforts to expand awareness of the prevalence and economic burden of glaucoma. Their advocacy surrounding the first-ever World Glaucoma Day has been truly valuable in promoting eye health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
