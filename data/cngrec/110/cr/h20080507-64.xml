  <narrative>FORECLOSURES AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3181]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, we were discussing very important legislative initiatives dealing with the Neighborhood Stabilization Act that would give $15 billion to reclaim foreclosed homes, and an important legislative initiative, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act that would revise a number of the GSEs like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, all to help the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my discussion on the floor of the House, I indicated that we are moving  toward a recession and a depression. The gentleman who was then managing the rule, <bill type="hr" number="1175">H. Res. 1175</bill>, indicated that we as Democrats must stop telling untruths. To that I asked the gentleman whether or not he was calling me a liar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to read into the Record that when that inquiry was made, the gentleman responded, as I said, I assume that he was not suggesting that I am a liar. The gentleman said "I did not suggest that at all."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that America is suffering. Between 7,000 and 8,000 people a day are filing for foreclosures and that consumer confidence is down. We are moving toward a recession and maybe a depression.</paragraph>
