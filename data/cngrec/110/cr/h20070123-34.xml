  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of our troops and <bill type="h" number="511">H.R. 511</bill>, legislation reaffirming Congress's support for the troops deployed in a theater of war. Those overseas protecting us from further terrorist attacks and fighting nobly on the Global War on Terror deserve our steadfast support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has recognized missteps and offered a new direction and plan for victory. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have yet to address the issue, except to criticize the President's plan before it has even been implemented. It was Leader BOEHNER and the Republican Conference that have called upon the Speaker to create a select committee on oversight to hold the President and Prime Minister Maliki accountable for progress in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I stand here with pride and offer my full support to the brave soldiers who are helping foster democracy in the Middle East, while, at the same time preventing terrorists from attacking us on our soil. So many Members pledged "We will never forget." Well, that is a promise I made and intend to fulfill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To our troops, thank you for your dedication, bravery and noble work to make the world and America a better place, following in the footsteps of so many American heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Congressman Sam Johnson, an American hero, and urge support of <bill type="h" number="511">H.R. 511</bill>.</paragraph>
