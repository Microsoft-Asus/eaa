    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="5506">H.R. 5506</bill> which names the postal facility in Jersey City, New Jersey, after Bishop Ralph E. Brower. <bill type="h" number="5506">H.R. 5506</bill>, which was introduced by Representative ALBIO SIRES of New Jersey on February 27, 2008, was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure has the support of the entire New Jersey delegation and provides this body a chance to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of a distinguished and highly respected gentleman from the Garden State of New Jersey, the admirable Bishop Ralph E. Brower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Representative Sires is unable to join us on the floor today, but nonetheless, he asked that his statement of support be submitted for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born into humble beginnings in North Carolina as the eldest of six children, Bishop Brower's educational aspirations led him to attend Laurinburg Institute and Kettle College of North Carolina. He received his master's degree from Kings College in Briarcliff Manor, New York, his master's in divinity from Florida State University, and his Ph.D. from Grambling State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Brower began to make his mark on New Jersey and the community of Jersey City in the early 1950s when he took the helm of St. Michael's Methodist Church. Over the years, he has overseen the growth of the congregation from six members to the thousands that now worship at St. Michael's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Largely responsible for helping the church and its congregation blossom into a positive force for change in the community, Bishop Ralph E. Brower undoubtedly deserves the honor of having a United States postal facility named after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this measure by voting in favor of <bill type="h" number="5506">H.R. 5506</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5506">H.R. 5506</bill>, a resolution to designate the post office located at 369 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Jersey City, New Jersey, as the "Bishop Ralph E. Brower Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Ralph E. Brower, a Methodist pastor and native of North Carolina, has been a vital presence in the religious and civic communities of northern New Jersey for over five decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A community leader and accomplished intellectual, Bishop Brower is, above all, a devoted family man. Married to his loving wife, Alberta, for over 60 years, the bishop has been the guiding force in the lives of his three wonderful children and 18 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His dedication to his denomination and community is exemplary, and it is fitting to name the post office in Jersey City, New Jersey, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generous and compassionate, Bishop Brower's passion for religious and civic duties is fueled by a personal commitment to intellectual development. After receiving his B.A. from Kettle College, he went on to earn an M.A. from Kings College, and finally a Ph.D from Grambling State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Academic accolades only scratch the surface of a man who has devoted so much of his life to improving the lives of the people surrounding him. He served in numerous positions including as the Commissioner for the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency and 4 years as the Deputy Mayor of Jersey City. His service demonstrates that he truly is a man of the people. This devotion has not gone unnoticed. Over the years, the Bishop has received a number of accolades for his civic devotion by organizations  such as the New Jersey Urban League and NAACP.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5506">H.R. 5506</bill> which would designate the U.S. Postal Service building located at 369 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Jersey City, New Jersey as the "Bishop Ralph E. Brower Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Ralph E. Brower has dedicated more than 50 years of his life in service to the community of Jersey City, New Jersey. In 1954, he was called to build the St. Michael Methodist Church. He started the church with only six members, and served their parish as pastor for over 54 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his role as pastor, Bishop Brower served the Jersey City community in  many ways. His professional and ministerial accomplishments also include being president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance for 25 years; Hudson County Chaplain for 25 years; commissioner for the Jersey City Redevelopment for 5 years; and deputy mayor for 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With his lifetime of dedication to public service and ministry, Bishop Ralph E. Brower consistently illustrates his caring and commitment to the Jersey City community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am thrilled to celebrate this dedicated community leader through this legislation. I cannot think of better way to honor Bishop Brower's work then to designate a U.S. Postal Office in his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
