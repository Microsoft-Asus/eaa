  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Mongolia has made incredible strides to improve its relationship with the United States since 1987. Following the downfall of communism in that nation, our ties have grown exponentially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mongolia has worked hard in the past two decades to create a robust and strong democracy and the United States has been a partner in that effort from its inception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although it lies on the other side of the globe and sits between Russia and China, Mongolia has long sought close ties with the United States, with some even referring to the United States as its "Third Neighbor."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the economic front, the United States-Mongolian relationship is dynamic and growing with over one hundred U.S. and U.S.-Mongolian joint ventures registered in areas ranging from oil exploration, textiles, animal husbandry, tourism, mining, and banking. The United States is also one of Mongolia's largest sources of foreign investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While a large recipient of foreign aid, Mongolia still commits itself to giving back to the global community through its significant peacekeeping efforts in Africa and Eastern Europe, with personnel in Sierra Leone and Kosovo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mongolia is also a strong partner in the War on Terror. Mongolia has contributed engineers, troops, and medical personnel to Operation Iraqi Freedom and has participated in training National Army artillery units in Afghanistan. Prior to 2000, Mongolia did not have a national policy of deploying forces beyond its borders. Yet they were the first coalition country to contribute an infantry battalion to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mongolia's contributions mean a bit more to the State of Alaska. Since 2003, we have partnered with Mongolia through the Alaska-Mongolia National Guard Partnership. Our National Guard has established broad working relationships and increased exchanges with their Mongolian partners. They stand side by side with the Mongolian Armed Forces in Iraq--in fact, the Mongolian Ministry of Defense specifically requested Alaska National Guard support based on Alaska's relationship with their nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success that the partnership has enjoyed is a direct reflection of the willingness and eagerness on both sides to further our relations. The Alaska National Guard tells me that Mongolia is enthusiastic about their democratic reforms and is aggressively working to meet its goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with 2007 being the 20th Anniversary of U.S.-Mongolia relations, I am proud to introduce this resolution marking our ties and the significant progress that has been achieved between our two countries in that short time frame. I look forward to what the next 20 years will bring.</paragraph>
