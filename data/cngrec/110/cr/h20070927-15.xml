  <narrative>FREEDOM OF SPEECH -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10942]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday there was a continuing resolution with a motion to recommit that attacked  MoveOn.org. I voted against that motion to recommit, and I did it because it attacked the first amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a tradition in the House that we address the conduct and not speech, speech which is protected by the first amendment, that flag, and the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when we start to attack speech and don't attack other speech, by implication we approve of the other speech. This House by not attacking Don Imus for his statements about African American women, this House by not attacking the individuals who questioned Max Cleland's citizenship or his honor, this House that did not condemn Rush Limbaugh and his statements about Senator Hagel and Michael J. Fox, or Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson who question people who are gay and lesbian and feminists  for the attacks or Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we attack one group for speech and don't attack others, by implication we approve the other's speech, and that is wrong, and that is why the motion to recommit was wrong, and it is a dangerous precedent.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
