    <paragraph>Mr. President, what is the business now?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are in the splendor of this beautiful Senate Chamber. We have all had a good night's rest. But around America today, there are people in the West who are just awakening and people in the East have been awake for a while. But a lot of those people have had bad nights; they are in danger of losing their homes. They don't know what to do. They realize other homes have gone to foreclosure and the neighborhood is going down. They can see it, and it has put a pall over the  economic viability of our country. That is what this legislation is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those people will benefit from what was done in the Senate yesterday, and we will, I believe, sometime early next week, pass this bill. It is going to be a tremendous help to those people around America who are suffering as a result of this housing crisis, and they are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes we don't recognize what we need to do and what we have done. I feel it is extremely important to spread on the record--I have tried to do this the last few days--that the work done by the chairman of the committee, Senator Dodd, the ranking member, Senator Shelby, is exemplary work, bipartisan work. Recognizing the slim majority we Democrats have in the Senate, 51 to 49, anything we do is going to be close, people are going to have to give up some of their ideas as  to a perfect world and recognize that sometimes we have to compromise. That is what legislation is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admire and appreciate the work that was done by the entire Senate yesterday.</paragraph>
