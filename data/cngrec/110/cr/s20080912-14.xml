  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="TRIBUTE TO MARGARET &quot;PEGGY&quot; SIMS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a longtime public servant who spent her career working hard to improve the quality of elections. Ms. Margaret Sims spent her entire career working for both of the agencies under the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee--the Federal Election Commission and the Election Assistance Commission. She passed away earlier this month after a long battle with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A resident of Burke, VA, Ms. Sims, known to her friends as "Peggy", was born in Schenectady, NY, and was a graduate of Wells College. She was an intern in the community services department at the AFL-CIO before starting her career at the FEC as an investigator. She also served as Director of Compliance and Election Administrative Research Specialist at that agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long before the 2000 election and hanging chads, Ms. Sims was working hard with our Nation's election administration professionals to provide them with the best information available to help them do their job. While at the FEC, she assisted in developing voting systems standards and in the creation  of a guide and training tools to accompany the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. She was also part of the first U.S. delegation to the Trilateral Conference  between Canada, Mexico and the United States held in Mexico City in 1994. This conference engaged the three countries in dialogue regarding their respective election processes so that each country might learn from the others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She moved to the newly created U.S. Election Assistance Commission in 2004, where she assisted in guiding States in appropriate voting procedures and in training them how to report back to that agency. She provided guidance to the new EAC Commissioners and assisted them in developing a working knowledge of the election administration process. During the challenging implementation of the Help America Vote Act, hundreds of election officials relied on her assistance in getting the law right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because she worked in the field of elections, Ms. Sims was always nonpartisan. She proudly said that she would not even let her husband put a political bumper sticker on his car. Her emphasis on providing assistance in an impartial, unbiased way is a testament to her dedication. She did not care about who won or lost, she cared that the process was always fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She is survived by her husband and son, Dug and Jay Greevy, as well as her mother, two brothers, and a sister.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to remember not only the life of Peggy Sims but also the impact of her work. She worked hard every day for civic leadership and better government. She rose above partisan labels. We honor her memory by recognizing her commitments to public service and to shaping better elections for our country.</paragraph>
