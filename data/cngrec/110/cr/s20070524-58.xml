    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Estelline, SD. The town of Estelline will celebrate the 125th anniversaty of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Hamlin County, Estelline was founded in 1882. The community's folklore explains that the town was named after the daughter of one of its early resident's; however, they just do not know which one. It was either the daughter of a prominent landowner, D.J. Spalding, or of Judge Granville Bennett. This story is just another example of the rich history that can be found in South Dakota's rural communities. Over the past 125 years, Estelline has been a successful and thriving community  and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and traditions for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to rise with the citizens of Estelline in celebrating their 125th anniversary and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
