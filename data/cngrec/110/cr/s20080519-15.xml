  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, and, of course, to my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, this Senator certainly did not mind waiting because it was a matter of great concern. And it was obvious to this Senator in the elevator that the Senator from Pennsylvania had a matter of great weightiness that was something that he wanted to share with the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I shall always defer to the eminent scholar of the Senate, and I am glad that the Senator has spoken, and spoken his mind. This Senator would like to speak his mind on a subject that is heavy on the hearts of the American people; that is, what is the future of their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear people are concerned because health care has become something that dominates someone's thinking, if they do not have the assurance of having that health care. The number of insured has reached 47 million people. It looks like that number is going to increase, particularly as we are going into an economic downturn that plagues us and seems it will continue to do so. In the meantime, the American people also know health care costs are increasing at a rate much higher than their average  paycheck. So that worries the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fact that Americans spend more money on health care than any other country in the world. Sometimes we don't have as good results. For example, one recent study says life expectancy among certain groups of women in the United States is actually going down due to the prevalence of growing chronic disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Florida, the problems are no less severe: 19 percent of all children in Florida are uninsured, one of the highest rates in the country; 25 percent of all nonelderly Floridians are uninsured, a quarter of the nonelderly Floridians, those not covered on Medicare. Of course, the people are getting concerned because we in Washington are unable, between the executive and the legislative branches, to strike a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The long and short of it is, there are some solutions that are starting to percolate to the top. There is one that has 7 Democrats and 7 Republicans, 14 of us, bipartisan cosponsors. What it does is, it insures everybody universal coverage, the 47 million people who now do not have health insurance who, by the way, get health care because they get it at the most expensive place when they get sick, which is the emergency room, and they get it at the most expensive time, because they haven't had  preventive care, when the sniffles turn into pneumonia so the treatment is all the more expensive, so the most expensive place at the most expensive time. Guess who all is paying for it. The rest of us are paying for it because they do not pay and do not have the health insurance that goes into the overall absorption of those costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rest of us, who are fortunate to have health insurance, pay in the rates we pay for the care we get. That is one important principle of what this group of 14 bipartisan Senators, led by Senator Wyden and Senator Bennett, have come out with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next important principle of this proposal for completely revamping and reforming the health insurance delivery system is that you let the principle of insurance work for you. That is, to get the largest possible group--in other words, millions of people--over which to spread the health risk. So if you spread that health risk over millions of people who are representative of the whole population, young and old, sick and well, you are going to bring down the per-unit cost for the premium per  policyholder. That is in significant contrast to the fact of a small group, where the actuarial soundness in order to set the premiums for a small group--let's say 5 or 10 people, just a few lives over which to spread that health risk--is extremely high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is one of the reasons why in taking that principle of insurance, you have to decouple from saying that insurance should be organized on the basis of an employer. If an employer is large, with 100,000, a couple hundred thousand lives, then, in fact, you have a large population over which to spread the health risk. However, if the employer is a mom-and-pop grocery store, with only a handful of lives, you see the prohibitive cost of that insurance and, therefore, what is happening is, employers  are at the point that they are not able to afford it anymore. More and more people of those 47 million in this country who are not insured, in fact, are adding to those rolls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what this bipartisan bill, called the Healthy Americans Act, is attempting to do is to say: We are going to bring in all those people out there who are uninsured so we spread the base, and we are going to organize the private marketplace upon which private insurance companies will compete for that business. We are going to organize it ideally around millions of people. The way the bill is structured, it organizes it around the State. But if that State is a small one, there is nothing that  would prohibit that State from joining with several other small States to create a sizable population that the health insurance companies would, in fact, compete for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, the next principle in this insurance is that the consumer will have choice. The basic underpinning of the minimal value of a health insurance policy is the same kind we have. We, as Federal employees, have a minimal health benefit package from the Federal Government. We spread our insurance cost over 9 million Federal employees and Federal retirees. Therefore, we can get the economies of scale and let the Federal size work for us. So, too, the reorganization in this bill, the Healthy Americans  Act, to allow the greater numbers to bring down that per-unit cost or the cost, in other words, of what the individual policyholder makes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a very complicated system, how you transition out from an employer. There is a certain amount that the employer has to pay into the system, according to the size and the payroll. Individuals would have the responsibility of paying for their health insurance. They would pay for that by deductions from the Federal income tax, just like withholding tax is deducted now. By decoupling from their employer's insurance, if they chose to do that--and if they wanted to stay with the employer, they  could, but by decoupling, they would not get less money because there would be the so-called cashing out of the employee, so the employee would get the same financial benefit from the employer they got before, when the employer was paying for their health insurance premiums. It is all very complicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressional Budget Office has done a cost analysis and says under this law the Federal Government will break even financially in the year 2014, when it is implemented, if it were to first be implemented starting this year. So it basically requires the responsibility on the individual, the employers, and the Government to come together to make this funding for health care work. You get the efficiencies of competition in the private marketplace. You get the economy of scale. That economy  of scale is not only brought in by expanding the pools  over which that insurance is applied but expanding those pools even more by bringing in the 47 million uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill emphasizes prevention to improve the health of Americans. It certainly improves their access to care, once they get sick, and also access to care by giving them preventive incentives to go in and do the kind of things with medical advice before they would ever get sick in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are things in the bill that, as we continue to discuss it, certainly I wish to see. I wish to make absolutely sure that those currently covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program, which would be folded into this, as well as Medicaid, which would be folded into the program, I wish to make sure they receive affordable insurance of quality comparable to or better than what they currently receive. There are other concerns that will come up from time to time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no one who has filed this legislation who thinks it is going to be enacted or seriously taken up this year, but there has to be a starting point. A great responsibility will rest on the shoulders of the next President because the American people are not only crying out for health care reform, they are demanding it. Because the cost of that health care is extending beyond their reach, it is incumbent upon us to be visionary and creative. It is certainly incumbent upon the next President  to be visionary and creative and cooperative, cooperative with the Congress so we can forge a solution to help America solve her health insurance problem.</paragraph>
