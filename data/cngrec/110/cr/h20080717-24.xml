    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we did today, 234 years ago Congress heard its first prayer as they opened their Congress. And I wanted to read that prayer this morning because I think it's a prayer for America and this Congress today:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Be Thou present; O God of Wisdom, and direct the councils of this Honorable Assembly. Enable them to settle all things on the best and surest foundations; that the scene of blood may be speedily closed; that Order, Harmony, and Peace may be effectually restored, and Truth, and Justice, Religion, and Piety prevail and flourish among the people. Preserve the health of their bodies and the vigor of their minds. Shower down on them, and the millions they here represent, such temporal blessings as  Thou seest expedient for them in this world, and crown them with everlasting Glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus Christ Thy son and Our Savior. Amen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may prayer always be a part of this body, and may prayer always be a part of America.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
