    <paragraph>I would also say, Mr. President, that I have conferred with the Republican leader, and there is no reason that we will have any votes scheduled for Tuesday, the day we return. Monday is a legal holiday, and Tuesday we are going to start the stem cell debate. The debate on that will last for at least 2 days, so there is no reason we will need to come back for a vote on Tuesday. People will have plenty to do here, and the vote would just interrupt that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have told the Republican leader, and he acknowledges that is probably the right thing to do. So we will have no votes on Tuesday. The first vote will be sometime on Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is no further business today, I would turn to the Republican leader.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would just say to the majority leader that I agree there is no necessity to have a vote on Tuesday, the week after next, and I think we will proceed with the debate on the stem cell proposals and be ready to vote on Wednesday.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I failed to announce, but it was very important, those numbers that we read off were two very important ambassadorships:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ford M. Fraker, to be the Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Zalmay Khalilzad, who, of course, has served so well in Iraq and is now going to be the Ambassador to the United Nations. That is very important, and I am glad we did that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing I did not mention is, for all Senators and staff, our Democratic caucus, which is normally held on Tuesday, we are going to have that on Wednesday. It is obvious now, with no votes on Tuesday, that is probably the right thing to do. So, for all Democrats, we will have our caucus on Wednesday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Republican leader.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, likewise on this side of the aisle, we will be having our policy luncheon, which normally happens on Tuesday, on Wednesday. We have already notified our members of that, but it bears repeating here today.</paragraph>
