    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="944">H. Res. 944</bill>, honoring the service and accomplishments of Lieutenant General Russel L. Honore, United States Army, for his 37 years of service on behalf of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me first take a moment to thank Representative David Scott of Georgia for helping us to recognize General Honore and getting this resolution to the floor here today. And I want to certainly allow him the spotlight in terms of talking about this extraordinary gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very briefly, he is a native of Lakeland, Louisiana, graduated from Southern University and A&amp;M College in 1971. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his career, General Honore has served a number of infantry command positions in the Army, including tours in Germany and as commanding officer of the Second Infantry Division in Korea. He had also seen action in Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm and served as Vice Director for Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff here in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his efforts and command, he was responsible for the training and deployment of a half million National Guard and Reserve members. In addition, he led the Joint Task Force Katrina following the hurricane's destruction of the gulf coast in 2005, where he commanded all active duty troops from all branches dedicated to storm recovery operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation owes a debt of gratitude to General Honore for his commitment to the defense of our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="944">H. Res. 944</bill>, which honors the distinguished career of Army Lieutenant General Russel Honore, who is retiring, as has been said, after 37 years of service to this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Army is known for its tradition, strength, and valor, and Lieutenant General Honore exemplifies what it means to be a soldier. The general has had a career that young soldiers dream about. He saw action in both Iraq and Kuwait during the first Gulf War. He has earned 15 awards and decorations and has served overseas in both Germany and Korea. But perhaps  his most significant contribution to the Nation was as commander to the Joint Task  Force Katrina following the devastation of the gulf coast in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The general commanded troops from all branches of our military in one of the worst natural disasters that our country has ever experienced. He was working not only to help repair his native State of Louisiana, but he was working to repair his country, and he did so in exemplary fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to honor Lieutenant General Honore and his family, Beverly, Stephanie, Kimberly, Stephen, and Michael, the best in what comes next for them, and I thank them for their commitment to this country as a family. I congratulate the general on his magnificent career, and I urge all Members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague, the sponsor of this resolution, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>To my two distinguished colleagues who have taken the leadership on this time on the floor, I thank you for your graciousness in allowing us to bring up <bill type="hr" number="944">H. Res. 944</bill> and at the same time to recognize what is arguably an extraordinary and great moment in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this man, Lieutenant General Russel Honore, the only word that comes to mind, Mr. Speaker, is that word "great." There have been some great moments and great events in the last 7 years of this country that have threatened the very foundation of our country. The 9/11 of 2001 that launched the vicious attack on this country that led us into this extraordinary period of this war on terror, and then just 4 years later a great catastrophe, one of the greatest natural disasters to have ever hit  the United States of America and to the gulf coast of this country: Hurricane Katrina. Great events, great occasions bring forth the need to rise up to this occasion and these great occasions great men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here today to honor a great American, and we ought to pause for a moment and think about this word "great" that we are using to describe this great American, Lieutenant General Russel Honore. The word "great" means something of great magnificence. When that question was put to the great philosopher Aristotle, what does it take to be a great man, Aristotle said the first thing you've got to do is know thyself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I am here to tell you, Mr. Speaker, Russel Honore knew himself, and not only did he know who he was, Russel Honore knew whose he was, that he was foremost and first of all a child of God that had been brought on this Earth for a great need and a great occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later on in history that question was put to the great Roman general and soldier Marcus Aurelius. The question was put to Marcus Aurelius, what does it take to be a great man? Marcus Aurelius said, in order to be a great man, you must, first of all, discipline yourself. And so much has been said about the great soldiering of this great American. The hallmark word is "discipline," "focus." He endured hardness and toughness as a good soldier, and through that discipline came the loyalty, came  the courage that it took to fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but, more than that, to expound the toughness and the discipline that was needed to our fellow soldiers that came under his care. For there is no greater thing of General Honore than the love of his soldiers, and he exemplified that by heading up</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, that question was put to the great Messiah and prophet Jesus Christ when He was asked, Jesus, what does it take to be a great man? And Jesus replied, first of all, in order to be a great man, you must sacrifice yourself. And, oh, what a great sacrifice. And you must love your fellow man as you do yourself. And what greater exemplary of that was in going down into Katrina and not just soldiering, not just taking the time to protect the area, but clothing the people there, finding  food and shelter for them, and taking the time to stop beside the road of the agony that they were experiencing, put an arm around them, and help that gulf coast to recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, "greatness" is the word for General Russel Honore. And we are so grateful for him, for the role that he has played, and for the greatness of this man. For he came at the most opportune time to provide the most opportune service, and he is truly a great American serving a great Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, I will just tell you it's a privilege to stand on the floor here today to hear the testimony of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in tribute to this great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand here today in support of <bill type="hr" number="944">H. Res. 944</bill>, recognizing the 37 years of service of Lieutenant General Russel Honore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time it seemed our country's civil fabric was tearing before our very eyes, all of us felt we saw a Nation in peril. The efforts of elected officials at the local level, at the State level, at the Federal level were not up to the task of dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It took officers of the United States Armed Forces who provided the security that the whole country longed to see, and at the center of that was Lieutenant General Russel Honore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was my honor to go with my committee to the City of New Orleans in October of that year to try to help with the restoration of some of the medical care of the City of New Orleans, and during that trip, I went to the Oschner Clinic, which is there near downtown New Orleans. It's on a natural sort of rise between the Mississippi River and downtown New Orleans, so it was buffeted by the winds of the storm but spared from the floodwaters and was struggling valiantly to keep up with  the stream of human injury that was coming through the doors on a 24-hour-a-day basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, I spoke with some doctors in the emergency room at the Oschner Clinic. The feeling at the clinic was that they were going to be okay from the standpoint of did they have enough diesel fuel to run their generators, did they have enough medicines, but the civil unrest, which was building outside their walls, clearly continued to imperil them. Again, these were individuals who had ridden out the storm. They had stayed in the hospital during the storm to see the sick and wounded who  managed to come in. They had stayed at their posts as the floodwaters rose around them, not knowing if the floodwaters would stop before they got to their doors, but, indeed, stop they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you can imagine the heartbreak of this young emergency room physician who described to me 3 days into their turmoil, 3 days into their task, saved from the winds, spared from the waters, but they could hear the civil unrest boiling outside the doors. They could hear the gunshots. They could hear the shouts of the crowds. And they knew that their facility was clearly going to be targeted because they had seen on the news where other health care facilities had been targeted, because of perhaps  drug-seeking behavior, who knows why, but they were very much at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This emergency room doctor had brought his wife to the hospital because he felt she wasn't safe at home. He described how they had spent the night under his desk in their office waiting for the end to come. They had survived the winds. They had survived the water. They were not going to survive the riots outside the door.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then right before dawn, he heard a helicopter. Not unusual because there were news helicopters circling around the city on an almost continual basis. But this was a different kind of helicopter. It had a much throatier roar. And then there was another one and another one and another one. And they turned on the television to see the landing of Lieutenant General Russ Honore taking command of the city, taking control back. I cannot tell you today the relief in this young man's  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H1012]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm happy to come to the floor with my colleagues and honor the service of Lieutenant General Russ Honore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, sir, for what you did in restoring order to our country. Thank you for helping that young family in the emergency room that day. This Nation will forever be in your debt.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Jefferson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400201" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, Representative DAVID SCOTT, for bringing this resolution to the floor today to honor General Russel L. Honore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While General Honore deserves to be honored for his service to our Nation and by the people of Georgia for the experiences he has had in connection with them, in truth he belongs, at his roots, to the people of Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Russel Honore was born in Louisiana in the rural parish of Pointe Coupee. I have known him for 39 years. I met him when he was a brash, young ROTC cadet at the college we both attended, Southern University and A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge. In fact, we've often kidded that since I was a few years ahead of him at Southern and his battalion commander there when he joined our ROTC, I can take some real credit for his success as a soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However that may be, Russel Honore showed the attributes back then that led to what can only be described as a legendary career in the U.S. Army. He was a serious student, an eager participant in everything the ROTC had to offer outside of the classroom and inside, and he had a big, courageous, fun-loving heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We who have known him for years, then, are not surprised that he led with distinction commands in Fort Hood, Texas; Washington, D.C.; Georgia; and Korea; and most recently as commander of the U.S. Southern Command for Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans, however, will always remember him most for the order he brought out of the chaos in the aftermath of the terrible storms Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that ripped apart the lives of our people in Louisiana. He, more than anyone else, took charge of the urgent rescue and relief of flooding victims there and made the bureaucracy bow to reason and good judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We applaud him for that. We congratulate him on a distinguished military career. A grateful Nation, therefore, wishes General Russel Honore God's choicest blessings in his retirement years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="944">H. Res. 944</bill>, honoring the service and accomplishments of Lieutenant General Russel L. Honor&#xE9; United States Army, for his 37 years of service on behalf of the United States. I would like to thank my distinguished colleague Congressman DAVID SCOTT for introducing this important legislation, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Katrina was one of the darkest hours of our Nation's recent history. Although the courage and generosity demonstrated by the American people was nothing short of heroic, the response of the federal government, especially FEMA, was nothing short of an embarrassment. I never imagined that my neighbors in New Orleans would be called and treated like refugees in war ravaged developed countries. The response of the Bush Administration was unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, even in the midst of tragedy and mismanagement, many Americans throughout this country stepped up to help those affected by this disaster. This demonstrated that once again in our darkest hour that we united as a nation to help our brothers and sisters who sought to recover and rebuild their lives. In particular, a small number of extraordinary individuals became true heroes; one of the most remarkable was Lieutenant General Russel Honor&#xE9;.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Called by New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin a man who can "get some stuff done," Lieutenant General Honor&#xE9;'s life is truly an American story. Born in Lakeland, Louisiana, General Honor&#xE9; graduated from Southern University and A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After graduating with a baccalaureate degree in vocational agriculture, General Honor&#xE9; was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. General Honor&#xE9; eventually graduated from Troy State University  with a master's degree in Human Resources and received an honorary doctorate in public administration from Southern University and A&amp;M College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Honor&#xE9; began his distinguished military career serving in a number of infantry command positions for the Army, including overseas tours in Germany and as a commanding officer in the Second Infantry Division in Korea. He saw action in Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. Honor&#xE9;'s experience and skill made him a logical candidate to serve as vice director for operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff; deputy commanding general and assistant commandant of the United States  Army Infantry Center and School at Fort Benning, Georgia; and assistant division commander, maneuver/support for the First Calvary Division at Fort Hood, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more than his impressive record of military service, Lt. General Russel Honor&#xE9; is perhaps best known for his strong leadership attributes. Lieutenant General Honor&#xE9; commanded the First United States Army, responsible for the training and deployment of 500,000 National Guardsmen and reserve service members. Lieutenant General Honor&#xE9; also led the Joint Task Force Katrina, following the hurricane's destruction of the Gulf Coast in 2005, where he commanded all active-duty troops  from all military branches dedicated to the storm recovery operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my home district in Houston has been pleased to welcome with open arms well over 100,000 survivors fleeing the storm, including a reported 21,000 children. I spent countless hours after this immense tragedy with the men, women, and children who fell victim to this catastrophic storm; I witnessed first hand the terror and despair of children separated from their  parents, men and women who had lost their entire livelihoods, and families who had seen homes full of memories and treasures destroyed in flood waters. I represent thousands of the Katrina evacuees who continue to reside in Houston, I consider their plight and hardship a personal one with which I am intimately familiar, and I am proud of my community's response to this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the hours, days, weeks, and months after the Katrina struck the gulf coast, the actions of Lt. General Honor&#xE9; and those like him were a lifeline for thousands of displaced, frightened, and imperiled residents. His bravery was so often the difference between life and death, or between hope and despair. Those of us who were on the ground in those days and weeks following the storm know just how valuable his actions were, just how vital his leadership was, and just how much the region needed  many more leaders like him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend Lieutenant General Honor&#xE9; for his 37 years of service on behalf of the United States. Lieutenant General Honor&#xE9; has proven his dedication and commitment to the Army and his leadership in post-Katrina recovery effort. I recognize his loyalty as a soldier, commander, and leader and for displaying throughout his distinguished military service the highest levels of leadership, professional competence, integrity, courage. Many of those who survived this storm did  so only because of the bravery, selflessness, and immense leadership of Lt. General Honor&#xE9; and other heroes like him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over two years have passed since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, and we continue to mourn the at least 1,836 innocent victims of the storm. We also continue to address the difficult issues raised by the storm, including the rebuilding of affordable housing in the area, and the restoration of local education systems. As a proud Houstonian, a firsthand witness to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, and a believer in the power of the American people, as demonstrated by Lt. General  Honor&#xE9;, I strongly urge my colleagues to remember those who perished, honor those who found such bravery within themselves, and to continue to work to provide for the still-suffering victims of the storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a recent media interview, Lt. General Honor&#xE9; spoke of what he hoped his legacy would be. He spoke of an effort to guide civilian America, encouraging a "culture of preparedness" in the spirit of his own cold-war upbringing. He stated that despite government investment in disaster response mechanisms, civic response remains weak, stating, "I'm sure you and your wife have a plan to meet at Uncle Joe's house, but does your plan include asking Mrs. Smith next door if she needs a ride?"  This is a vital, and too often overlooked, component of disaster planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would again like to voice my support for <bill type="h" number="944">H.R. 944</bill>, and finally give back something to a man that has already given so much to his country.</paragraph>
