  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="ANNIVERSARY OF THE SACRAMENTO PUBLIC LIBRARY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 150th anniversary of the Sacramento Public Library in Sacramento, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Sacramento Library opened on November 8, 1857, for members who paid dues equivalent to $300 a year today. It served 260 members with an annual circulation of 4,234 books. On June 14, 1879, the city of Sacramento assumed ownership of the library and residents were given the opportunity to utilize the library at no cost. In 1914, with the help of a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, the original building for the current Sacramento Central Library was built with a volume collection of 65,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to serving the reading needs of the community, the Sacramento Public Library also provides other important educational tools. It provides access to books on tape, learning exhibits, computers, and college and career counselors. The library also offers literacy services and has staff available to answer questions seven days a week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Central Library has come a long way since its beginning; it had a multistory building addition in 1992 and now houses over 300,000 volumes, 1,000 periodical subscriptions and a garden reading area for an outdoor reading environment. Over the years, the Sacramento Public Library added locations in 11 other cities in Sacramento County, with 27 total branches and bookmobiles now serving over 1 million residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the community and staff gather to celebrate the Sacramento Public Library's sesquicentennial, I would like to congratulate the whole community on this wonderful achievement and wish them luck on another 150 years of successful learning.</paragraph>
