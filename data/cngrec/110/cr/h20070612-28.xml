  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, health savings accounts are one of the best ways to put families back in control of their health care destiny. HSAs have expanded coverage, but Congress needs to make them more practical for working families and patients in poor health, and also remove rules that discriminate against veterans and seniors in Medicare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, I introduced <bill type="h" number="2639">H.R. 2639</bill> to permit larger contributions, allow coverage below the deductible for prescription drugs, and provide tax relief for premiums. The bill removes barriers that make it illegal for families to deposit their own money in an HSA after they receive care through Medicare or the VA. It also helps working families to build intergenerational "wealth for health" by allowing adult children to inherit a Medicare HSA in the same way that a spouse may now do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes sense to help Americans save for future medical costs, especially when we consider our Nation's negative savings rate and Medicare's looming financial problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to expand consumer choice and control it.</paragraph>
