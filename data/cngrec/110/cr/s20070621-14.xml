    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise briefly to speak for a few moments about the horrible tragedy we witnessed Tuesday morning in Charleston, SC: the death of nine firefighters: Captain Wiliam "Billy" Hutchinson, Captain Mike Benke, Captain Louis Mulkey, Engineer Mark Kelsey, Engineer Bradford "Billy" Baity, Assistant Engineer Michael French, Firefighter James "Earl" Drayton, Firefighter Brendon Thompson, and Firefighter Melvin Champaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, this loss is one of profound sadness for the Charleston community and, indeed, for the entire Nation. My thoughts and prayers go out to these firefighters' loved ones, families, friends, and colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These nine brave men died while fighting a horrific multialarm fire in which two people were ultimately  saved. In other words, they selflessly gave their lives while ensuring the safety and well-being of others. This is the ultimate sacrifice of a firefighter--a sacrifice that has been made by 3,148 men and women since 1981.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must never forget the dangers firefighters across our Nation dauntlessly face each and every day--dangers that have their roots in nature or mankind. Whether responding to fires, natural disasters, or acts of terrorism, our firefighters risk and give their lives extinguishing fires, delivering lifesaving emergency medical services, conducting search and rescue missions, and responding to and handling hazardous biological and radiological agents. Our Nation's firefighters certainly do not perform  these duties for any self-glorification. They perform these duties because each and every one of them answers a noble call to serve this country and protect its people from harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Woodrow Wilson once wrote that "......loyalty means nothing unless it has at its heart the absolute principle of self-sacrifice." Clearly, the loyalty of these nine firefighters--loyalty to duty, country, and each other--were tragically demonstrated overnight Monday. May we mourn them and draw inspiration from their actions. May we never forget them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, tomorrow in Charleston will be a citywide day of mourning for the nine firefighters who died, rushing into the blazing furniture store to try to save a life. I rise to pay my respects to those fallen heroes and to their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other day, when I heard the fire chief, Rusty Thomas, say he lost nine of his best friends, I know what he meant. So does every Senator in this Chamber because firefighters are the best things our communities have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They risk their lives every day we lay a heavy, heavy responsibility on them. But think of how many countless lives are saved because of their dedication, because they will find the people trapped inside a burning building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when our former colleague from Charleston, Senator Hollings, had the terrible fire that burned his home, it was those same South Carolina firefighters who came to help one of our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether they are in Charleston or the volunteers in Claymont, DE, where I come from, when they are done putting out a blaze, you can find them organizing the little league teams or grating the baseball diamonds or taking care of the boy and girl scouts. They are the grit that makes this country great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happened in South Carolina reminds all of us just how important firefighters are to our communities, how brave these people are, and how dangerous their work is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw it during Hurricane Katrina, when 1,000 firefighters who themselves lost their homes and their cars, whose whole lives were turned upside down, spent day after day rescuing people from rooftops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw it on September 11, when that grizzled fireman came out of the debris of human flesh and cement and steel to become the face around the world of America's determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three hundred forty-three firemen were lost on that terrible day. And the tragedy in Charleston is the single greatest loss of firefighters in the nation since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as the spirit of those firefighters on September 11 helped lift America off our knees, I hope that the grief Charleston feels this week will be lifted by the legacy of their fallen heroes.</paragraph>
