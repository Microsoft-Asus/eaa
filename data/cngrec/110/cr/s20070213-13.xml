  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first of all, I thank Leader Reid and Leader MCCONNELL for bringing this resolution  forward in a very timely fashion. We learned during the lunch hour today that Representative CHARLIE NORWOOD of Georgia passed away, a victim of cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE had been fighting valiantly that disease for over 3 years, having a lung transplant, and, unfortunately--after the transplant's success for a year and CHARLIE doing well--cancer occurred in one lung and then transferred to his liver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His wife Gloria has been an absolutely wonderful human being, seeing to it that CHARLIE continued to do his work in the House of Representatives, even though suffering greatly from the effects of the cancer that reoccurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE NORWOOD was elected in 1994 and was a classmate and fellow representative with many of us here--Senator Coburn, Senator Graham, Senator Lincoln, Senator Chambliss, and myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all of us who have had the chance to serve with CHARLIE NORWOOD, we today pay tribute to his life, the great accomplishments he made on behalf of his district, and his untiring effort to bring about quality, affordable health care within the reach of every single American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will be remembered for many things: his tenacity, his great sense of humor, his commitment to his district, and to his people. But from a political standpoint and a service standpoint, he will be remembered for Norwood-Dingell, the legislation that laid the groundwork for reforms in health care that even go on at this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as a Member of the Senate from Georgia, as a personal friend of CHARLIE NORWOOD and his beautiful wife Gloria, and as one who is so thankful for the contributions he made to my State, to me as an individual, and to this body, I pay tribute to CHARLIE NORWOOD, pass on the sympathy and the condolences of my family to his wife Gloria and his many friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, I repeat my thanks to Senator McConnell and Senator Reid for their timely recognition of the passing of CHARLIE NORWOOD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my pleasure now to, with unanimous consent, recognize Senator Chambliss from Georgia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Georgia is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from Georgia for those very generous and kind words about our mutual friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to pay tribute to a guy who has been a great inspiration not just for the last 3 years when he has so bravely fought the deadly disease that ultimately got him--cancer--but CHARLIE NORWOOD and I were elected to Congress together in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE was one of those individuals who came to Congress for the right reason; that is, to make this country a better place for our generation as well as for future generations to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE worked every single day to make sure he could personally do everything he could as a Member of the House of Representatives to make this country better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE grew up a Valdosta Wildcat. Now, to people in this body that may not mean a whole lot, but to anybody who lives in our great State, growing up a Valdosta Wildcat and playing for the Wildcat football team is a very special asset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Valdosta is a very unique town down in my part of the State, down in the very southern part of our State. The football lore of Valdosta is second to no other community in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE loved his Valdosta Wildcats. He and I used to sit on the floor of the House every now and then, particularly during football season, and talk about his days of growing up. My hometown of Moultrie is the biggest football rival of Valdosta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE loved life. He loved things like football. He also loved his family. He was the proud husband of Gloria Norwood, who is one more great lady, and he had two sons and several grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE used to take his grandchildren to Atlanta every year at Thanksgiving, used to take the girls. He would let those girls have the run of a very nice hotel in Atlanta to do whatever they wanted, including CHARLIE NORWOOD, a mean, gruff, old dentist from Augusta, GA, sitting down in the afternoon and having tea with his granddaughters. He was, indeed, a very special person, a guy who loved his country, loved his State, loved his family, and really cared about what is best for  America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One anecdote about CHARLIE I will never forget. He and I became good friends during the 1994 campaign. We both signed the Contract with America. We ran on the Contract with America. One provision in there was requiring an amendment to the Constitution calling for the Federal budget to be balanced. CHARLIE and I both felt very strongly about that. We were sitting on the floor of the House of Representatives one night together, as we were debating and voting on the amendment to the  Constitution calling for a balanced budget, and as the numbers in favor of the bill grew and grew, the roar within the Chamber itself got louder and louder. It took 397 votes to reach the point where the balanced budget amendment would pass, and when it hit 350, the roar got louder. It hit 360. Finally, it hit 397. CHARLIE looked over at me and said: SAX, that is why we came here. He was that kind of person who truly cared about his country and the principles for which he stood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man who will truly be missed, as my colleague, Senator Isakson, said, for his ideas on health care. He truly believed that every person who received health care treatment in this country ought to have the ability to look their physician in the eye and make sure they had the right to choose the physician from whom they were receiving medical services. It is only fitting that CHARLIE's Patient's Bill of Rights was reintroduced in the House in the last several days. I look  forward, hopefully, to Congressman Dingell taking up that bill and debating that bill. It was a controversial bill then. It will be controversial again. But just because CHARLIE NORWOOD felt so strongly about it, I am hopeful we will see some movement on that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I wind down, I have such fond memories about CHARLIE from a personal standpoint. But most significantly, the great memories I will always have about CHARLIE NORWOOD are about his commitment to America, his commitment to freedom, his commitment to the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States, of which he was one--he was a veteran of Vietnam--and about the great spirit CHARLIE NORWOOD always brought to every issue on the floor of the House of Representatives.  He was a great American. He was a great Member of the House of Representatives. He was a great colleague. He was a great friend who will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
