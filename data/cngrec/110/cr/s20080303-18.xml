  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to comment about the serious problem in the judicial confirmation process where Federal judges are pawns in political partisanship. I wrote to my distinguished colleague Senator Leahy on February  29, last Friday. I sent him an extensive letter on the subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional Record the full text of that letter at the conclusion of my comments.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <narrative>(See Exhibit 1.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, during the past 20 years, we have seen a very serious deterioration in the processes in the Senate on the confirmation of Federal judges. Without a broad sweep of historical reference, I believe it has been a very low point in the confirmation of Federal judges since the beginning of the Republic, but in order to say that with absolute certainty, there would have to be a very intense historical survey undertaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is plain that since the last 2 years of President Reagan's administration until the present day, the confirmation process has broken down whenever the White House has been controlled by one party and the Senate controlled by the other party. In the last 2 years of the Reagan administration, the judicial confirmation process broke down. In the 4 years of the administration of President George H. W. Bush, the confirmation process was riveted with partisanship. When Republicans gained control  of the Senate starting in January of 1995, during the last 6 years of the administration of President Clinton, the Republican Senate retaliated, and more than retaliated; it exacerbated the problem. Then, when the administration of President George W. Bush came, the Democrats were in control for about a year and a half of that process. Again, the process was</paragraph>
    <paragraph>stymied. Then it got even worse. Then, even though the Republicans had gained control of the Senate, after the 2002 elections, there were filibusters, which were very destructive to the Senate. Then, there was a very serious challenge to the filibuster rule. The Democrats were filibustering President Bush's nominees and Republicans responded with a so-called constitutional or nuclear option to change the filibuster rule to reduce the number from 60 to 51.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of these battles, with one side raising the ante and the other side raising the ante, exacerbating the controversy, I was willing to cross party lines and support the nominees of President Clinton who were qualified. For example, I crossed party lines to support Judge Marsha Berzon who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit on March 9, 2000, and Judge Timothy Dyk who was confirmed to the Federal Circuit on May 24, 2000. I supported Judge Richard Paez who was confirmed to the Ninth  Circuit on March 9, 2000, and Judge H. Lee Sarokin who was confirmed to the Third Circuit on October 4, 1994. Similarly, I supported President Clinton's nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch who was confirmed to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 24, 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also supported other controversial, nonjudicial confirmations such as Lani Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and the subsequent nomination of Bill Lann Lee for the same position. I was willing to cross party lines and support the nominees of the Democratic President. Now, I believe the Republican caucus is correct. In order to determine which caucus is to prevail, I believe the American people are going to have to be informed as  to what is going on. It is a picture, which I submit requires correction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Comparing the statistics on the confirmation of President Clinton's nominees versus President Bush's nominees shows a significant disparity. In the last 2 years of President Clinton's term, President Clinton was successful in confirming 15 circuit nominees and 57 district court nominees, while President Bush has been successful in confirming only 6 circuit court nominees and 34 district court nominees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking at the total of 8 years, there is, again, a great disparity. In President Clinton's 8 years, 65 circuit judges were confirmed and 305 district judges. During the full two terms up to the present time with President Bush, 57 circuit judges have been confirmed and 237 district court judges have been confirmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not just a matter of statistics, it is a matter of very substantial impact on the public, a very substantial impact on the courts, and a matter of very significant unfairness to the nominees themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is impossible with any other statistical analysis to draw any firm conclusions because the years overlap. Senator Leahy and I have already exchanged extensive, candidly argumentative correspondence, and he has made some points, but a close analysis shows that is not the case. When he cites the confirmations in the year 2007, for example, his figures look good because 13 of the judges were held over from the preceding 109th Congress. So, if those 13 are extracted, it is not the kind  of a picture that would show the statistical battle as tilting in his favor. But, I believe it goes much further than the statistics. It goes to what is happening day in and day out in the Federal courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There recently was extended publicity given to the Exxon Valdez case. The situation first arose in 1989 when 11 million gallons of crude oil were spilled in Alaska. The district court acted on the matter in 1994. The case is just now coming to the Supreme Court of the United States, which heard argument last week. In the interim, some 8,000 plaintiffs have died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the text of the letter which I have sent to Senator Leahy and which will be included in the Congressional Record, there are the designations of areas where there are judicial emergencies. "Judicial emergencies" means that there is an insufficient number of judges to handle the backlog of cases in the courts. That means the people who have gone to court to sue for damages in a personal injury case or to sue for defective automobiles or to sue for negligently formulated medicines  are delayed. The adage is well established in our lexicon that justice delayed is justice denied. I shall not elaborate in the limited amount of time I have on the many circuits and district courts where they face judicial emergencies because well-qualified judges have not been confirmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here again, I can mention only a few. But one nominee, Peter Keisler, whose nomination to the District of Columbia Circuit Court has been pending in Committee for more than 20 months, is a man who graduated magna cum laude from Yale, then graduated from Yale Law School, and was editor of the Yale Law Journal. Editorials in the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post have called for confirmation of Mr. Keisler, calling him a "moderate conservative" and a "highly qualified nominee" who "certainly  warrants confirmation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robert Conrad, nominated to the Fourth Circuit, is nominated to fill a judicial emergency and has been pending over 220 days. He is rated unanimously well qualified and graduated magna cum laude from Clemson University. An editorial in the Charlotte Observer stated it is "outrageous" that the Judiciary Committee has not held a hearing on Judge Conrad, calling him a "well-qualified judge who only 3 years ago received unanimous Senate confirmation," and who "was appointed by Democratic Attorney  General Janet Reno to head the Justice Department's Campaign Task Force." He is a former prosecutor and distinguished district court judge who was picked by the Attorney General of the opposite party to head a very important campaign finance task force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nominee Rod Rosenstein for the Fourth Circuit has been pending for over 100 days. The American Bar Association rated him unanimously well qualified. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, summa cum laude and Harvard Law School, cum laude. Two editorials in The Washington Post urged Senate confirmation of Mr. Rosenstein, and one stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Blocking Mr. Rosenstein's confirmation hearing would elevate ideology and ego above substance and merit, and it would unfairly penalize a man who people on both sides of this question agree is well qualified for a judgeship."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that statement by The Washington Post is as good a characterization as you can find. The conduct of the Senate today is elevating ideology and ego above substance. So I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to extend their hands across the aisle, as I did on so many occasions during President Clinton's tenure in office. How much time remains, Mr. President?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator has 8 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Eight minutes?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is 7 minutes 58 seconds remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair. The current presidential race provides the Senate with a unique opportunity to come to grips with the confirmation process of Federal judges and to make some very fundamental commitments and very fundamental changes to our process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in the midst of a Presidential campaign, and I think it is fair to say the outcome is uncertain. It has fluctuated tremendously on both nomination pictures. But, this is a time, with the outcome uncertain, when neither side of the aisle would know who will gain an advantage; we would not know whose ox was being gored. It is a time, starting in the next Congress--if we can't act now, and my fundamental plea is that we act at the present time--we ought not to wait 11 months, until January  20, 2009. This is a unique time to tackle the problem for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 1, 2004, I offered <bill type="sr" number="327">S. Res. 327</bill>, and I now offer the substance of that resolution again. The whereas clauses of the resolution recited a distressing array of facts similar to what we have at the present time, with filibusters by the Democrats and with the retaliatory prospect of changing the filibuster rule. The resolution called for establishing a timetable for hearings of nominees for district courts and courts of appeal and the Supreme Court to occur within 30 days after the names  of such nominees have been submitted to the Senate by the President and then to establish a timetable for action by the full committee within 30 days after the hearings and for reporting out nominees to the full Senate. And then to have a timetable for the full Senate to act within 90 days, with a provision for reasonable extension of times, upon agreement of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking member or the majority leader and the minority leader to extend the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution would establish procedures which would guarantee that the confirmation of judges would go back to the good old days, where you took a look at the person's academic credentials, you took a look at the person's professional background, you interviewed the individual, you had an FBI background check, and the person didn't have to pass some ideological purity test. Or, the individual did not have to pass a test such as what Judge Southwick was subjected to on this floor for months  and months and months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was particularly egregious in the case of Judge Southwick. Judge Southwick was a distinguished Mississippi State appellate court judge. He was nominated for the Fifth Circuit, and he had an extraordinary record, more than 10 years on the State court bench--more than 70 opinions. Objections were raised to two lines in two concurring opinions. Judge Southwick left the bench and went to Iraq and served for months in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He was interviewed by many people of the  Senate, and his confirmation hung on a thread until a courageous Senator from the other side of the aisle crossed party lines and led the way to get a few votes from the Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You don't have to be a profile in courage to support a judge such as Judge Southwick, and you don't have to be a profile in courage to support a nominee such as Rod Rosenstein or Peter Keisler or Robert Conrad or the others who were enumerated in my letter--some 10 circuit court judges and 18 district court judges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to quote a very respectable authority in my concluding comment. A man who has served in the Senate since he was elected from Vermont in 1974, twice chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and this is what the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, had to say on October 5, 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the Judiciary Committee reported only three nominees to the Court of Appeals all year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the last year of President Clinton's administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We denied a committee vote to two outstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I hope we can look again and ask ourselves objectively, without any partisanship: Can we not do better on judges?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is Senator Leahy. Going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quoted Governor George Bush--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was in the campaign process at that time in the 2000 election. Senator Leahy says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quoted Governor George Bush on the floor a couple of days ago. I said I agreed with him. On nominations he said we should vote them up or down within 60 days. If you don't want the person, vote against them. The Republican Party should have no fear of that. They have the majority in this body. They could vote against them if they want, but have the vote. Either vote for them or vote against them. Don't leave people such as Helene White and Bonnie Campbell, people such as this, just hanging  forever without even getting a rollcall vote. That is wrong. It is not a responsible way and besmirches the Senate, this body, that I love so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Leahy, you were right on October 5, 2000, and you are right on March 3, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit 1</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WASHINGTON, DC,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>February 29, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Patrick: I write in the hope that you and I can work out an accommodation on the confirmation of federal judges without our respective caucuses coming to an impasse. Without going into an elaborate history on the confirmation of federal judges, the essence of the situation is that 15 circuit judges and 57 district court judges were confirmed in the last two years of President Clinton's Administration, compared to 6 circuit court and 34 district court judges for President Bush in  2007-2008. That means there must be confirmations or at least up-or-down votes on 9 additional circuit and 23 district court judges to equal President Clinton's record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush is even farther behind President Clinton in total confirmations when contrasting their entire terms, since President Clinton confirmed 65 circuit court and 305 district court judges while President Bush has so far confirmed only 57 circuit and 237 district court judges. In addition, thus far in the 110th Congress, only 5 of President Bush's circuit court nominees have been granted hearings. By this date in President Clinton's final two years in office, the Committee had held hearings  for 10 circuit court nominees. Until the hearing for Ms. Catharina Haynes on February 21, 2008, we had not had a circuit court hearing since September 25, 2007, some 5 months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there have been many hotly contested issues in the Senate in recent years, the most bitter controversies have involved federal judicial nominations. In 2005, the battle over judges reached a high point, or low point, with the Republican caucus threatening to employ the "nuclear option" to combat the Democrats' filibusters. In my judgment, in the past twenty years, there has been a great deal of blame split evenly between both sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the record shows, I dissented from the Republican caucus's position by casting key votes in favor of several circuit court nominees, including controversial nominees such as Judge Marsha Berzon, who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 9, 2000, Judge Timothy Dyk, who was confirmed to the Federal Circuit on May 24, 2000, Judge Richard Paez, who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit on March 9, 2000, and Judge H. Lee Sarokin, who was confirmed to the Third Circuit on October  4, 1994. Similarly, I supported President Clinton's nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who was confirmed to the District Court for the Southern District of New York by a vote of 63-36 on May 24, 2000. I also supported other controversial non-judicial confirmations such as Lani Guinier to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the justice Department and the subsequent nomination of Bill Lann Lee for the same position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I believe that my caucus is correct in insisting on up-or-down votes on nominees with extraordinary records, including several who are nominated to fill seats deemed judicial emergencies. A listing of these nominees with their superb qualifications proves the point:</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It is my hope that we can work together to ensure that all of these nominees receive timely hearings and prompt votes in the Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of my extensive consultation with you in scheduling the hearings for Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, as well as our collaboration on numerous other Committee hearings, I was surprised when you scheduled a hearing for Judge Catharina Haynes on February 21st during the recess. I know you offered to postpone that hearing for a relatively brief period of time, but a formal, written request for a postponement would only have provided more grist for the argument mill on these issues.  I was prepared to cancel my previously scheduled work in Pennsylvania to attend the Haynes hearing until Senator John Warner, who was in Washington, agreed to attend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the uncertainty of who the next President will be, now would be a good time to change the confirmation process to guarantee prompt action on nominees with up-or-down votes. I again urge you to work for me to establish a schedule for prompt consideration of all currently pending judicial nominees and ensure they receive up-or-down votes in Committee and on the Senate floor. I have shared this letter with the other Republican members of the Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Republican leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="DISTRICT COURT NOMINEES">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commend the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for his comments, which I first watched from my office and then came to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can recall, and I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned this, the Berzon and Paez nominations at the end of the Clinton administration, where there was a lot of discontent on the Republican side of the aisle--strong feeling that these nominees were ideologically unacceptable. I remember then-majority leader in the Senate, Senator Lott, saying: We don't want to set the precedent that the ideological leanings of these nominees will deny them an up-or-down vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, similar to Senator Specter and Senator Lott, voted for cloture on those nominations, not to kill them but to move them forward. It was a very important decision on the part of then-Majority Leader Lott to prevent, to the maximum extent possible, the kind of meltdown that seems to have occurred in this Congress to which Senator Specter was referring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the beginning of this Congress, the majority leader, Senator Reid, and I discussed the need for the Senate to have a fair, less-contentious confirmation process. To his credit, I think that is his view and his goal. We have made some progress on circuit court nominations last year. We didn't match President Clinton's number from the first session of his last Congress, but we came close. Now, we had one notable bump along the way and Senator Specter referred to that and that  was the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick. But we were able to get him through, thanks to, as Senator Specter pointed out, the courageous decision on the part of particularly one Senator on the other side. It was good for the institution that we did that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the prospect of turning the page on judicial nominations, a goal which I think all but the hardiest partisans share, has taken a wrong turn. Despite the best efforts of Senator Specter and others, progress has all but ground to a halt. There have been no--I repeat, no--judicial confirmations so far this year--not one. There has been only one hearing on a circuit court nominee since September of last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that again. So far this year, the second session of the 110th Congress, not a single judicial confirmation--not one. With regard to circuit court nominees, only one hearing since September of last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is puzzling why progress has almost totally stopped. Some like to blame the President, but as the ranking member, Senator Specter, has noted, there are several circuit court nominees who have been pending for hundreds of days who have yet to receive a simple hearing--a hearing--let alone a committee or floor vote. In addition, many of these nominees satisfy most or all the chairman's specific criteria for prompt consideration. They have strong home State support--check the box on  that--they fill judicial emergencies, and they have good or outstanding ABA ratings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All these nominees Senator Specter referred to meet all those criteria. So it is puzzling why it is taking so long to move them. I hope the committee is not slow-walking these nominees based upon decade-old grievances, both real and imagined. That might be emotionally satisfying, but it will set a precedent that will serve us ill, regardless of who is in the White House and which party controls the Senate next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would hope our Democratic colleagues resist the desire by some to drag us into the judicial confirmation brinkmanship and establish a precedent they will regret. I hope they will treat these nominees fairly, before it is too late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I wish to particularly commend Senator Specter, our Republican leader on the Judiciary Committee, for pointing this out. He has excellent credentials to make this point because he made similar arguments when there was a Republican Senate and a Democratic President when he felt Members on our side of the aisle were being dilatory in providing fair consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what the standard is. Each of the last three Presidents have ended their tenures in office with the opposite party in control of the Senate. We know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the average number of circuit court judges appointed in the last 2 years of each of these three Presidents, when the opposite party controlled the Senate, was 17. We know the low end of that was President Clinton with 15. Right now, we have six. Even meeting the low threshold of President Clinton is a long way away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Specter has pointed out a way to meet that standard by reporting out of committee and confirming people who meet all of the criteria that have been specified by the chairman of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator Specter for his comments. I hope they will be heeded by people on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
