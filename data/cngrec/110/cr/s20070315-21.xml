    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Thomas Michael Hardiman for the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He has served on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. He has an outstanding academic record. He has a law degree from Georgetown, bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame. He started his practice of law in 1990. He has an outstanding record both academically and professionally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Santorum and I know him personally and can vouch for him. I urge my colleagues to confirm him for the Third Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that my full statements on the nominees be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="NOMINATION OF THOMAS M. HARDIMAN TO BE U.S. CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania said we are considering the nomination of Thomas Hardiman to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that has been designated a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the Senate confirmed Judge Hardiman to the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania at the age of 37. Four years later, and now 41 years old, Judge Hardiman is before the Senate for confirmation to lifetime tenure on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Out of deference to the home state Senators, Senator Specter and Senator Casey, I support this nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I only wish President Clinton's nominees, many of whom had a long record of accomplishment, had received the treatment we are according this nominee. Instead, highly qualified nominees, such as Elena Kagan, now Dean of the Harvard Law School, and Allen Snyder, who served as a clerk to Justice Rehnquist and was an experienced and respected litigator, were left without consideration for years. No questions were raised about their qualifications, as there have been for so many of President Bush's  nominations. The fact is that during President Clinton's last two years, Senate Republicans refused to consider more than half of his appellate court nominees. They were just blocked, pocket filibustered with impunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, we wasted enormous time and energy with controversial nominees. Now, a Democratic Congress has taken a better path and the high road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Hardiman has been nominated to a seat on the Third Circuit after serving as a Federal district court judge for four years. Before arriving on the bench, Judge Hardiman was a lawyer in private practice, where he worked for 13 years. In 1990, Judge Hardiman began his legal career as an Associate at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in Washington, DC. From 1992 to 2003, he engaged in the private practice of law in Pittsburgh, PA, first as a partner at the law firm of Titus</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Hardiman graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1987, and received his law degree from my alma mater the Georgetown University Law  Center, in 1990, where he served on the Georgetown Law Journal as a Notes and Comments Editor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank both home State Senators for their support of this nominee. I know Senator Specter, who has been a strong advocate for Judge Hardiman on the Committee, will welcome his confirmation. I also thank Senator Casey for his support, and for considering and approving this nominee so quickly after taking office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this confirmation, the Senate continues to make significant progress in this Congress on nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. We continue to put the lie to the alarmist rhetoric of some on the other side of the aisle by proceeding promptly and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This session of Congress, the Senate has already confirmed 10 judicial nominations, including the nomination of Norman Randy Smith to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And now the Senate stands poised to confirm a Second Circuit court nomination and will likely have confirmed 13 judges by the end of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The treatment of President Bush's judicial nominees in a Democratic Congress stands in stark contrast to the fate of many of President Clinton's nominees, who were blocked and delayed by the Republican majority. In the 1996 session, a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 17 of President Clinton's nominees--this year, we have already reported 15 nominees out of committee in just 3 months. In 1996, not a single judge was confirmed to the circuit courts--not one. This nomination is already  the second confirmed this year. In all, more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees were defeated in Senate committees through pocket filibusters and practices that Republicans then abandoned as soon as there was a Republican in the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 50 judicial vacancies, yet the President has sent us only 20 nominations for these vacancies. Thirty of these vacancies-more than half-have no nominee. Of the 22 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 16 of them. That means more than two-thirds of the judicial emergency vacancies are without a nominee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would rather see us work together in the selection of nominees so that we can confirm judges rather than spend time fighting about them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Judge Hardiman, and his family, on his confirmation today.</paragraph>
