    <paragraph>Madam President, despite the outcry for change in the wake of the deadliest shooting rampage in our Nation's history, too many schools continue to be plagued by gun violence. True prevention requires reducing the likelihood of death or injury before an incident occurs. Unfortunately, we have still not done enough to prevent dangerous guns from falling into the hands of those who may intentionally or unintentionally use them to harm themselves or others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, a group of engineering students at Kettering University, in Flint, MI, gathered in an apartment to celebrate the beginning of their 3-month job co-ops, part of their degree requirements. One of the students stumbled across a 9mm handgun lying on a dresser in one of the apartment's bedrooms. He picked up the weapon, and, after seeing himself in a mirror, made a sudden spin move with it. As he spun around, the gun accidentally discharged. Karl Joseph Hansen, 21 years old and  asleep at the time, died of a single gunshot wound to the head.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because a loaded handgun was present in an otherwise unremarkable  celebration, one student was left dead and another has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

The student responded to the visitor's requests for him to put the gun down by firing two rounds of blanks at the ceiling. When the visitor then tried to convince the student even blanks  could be dangerous, he is reported to have responded by asking "Why don't I point it at your head and find out?" When the student was subsequently arrested, police discovered an AK-47 assault rifle, AR-15 assault rifle, two rifles, a shotgun, several other pistols and nearly</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time after time, we see these tragedies reported in the news. Yet Congress has not taken the necessary steps to help control these acts of violence or ease the anxiety that many parents and families feel each day as their children head off to school. By removing firearms from potentially dangerous situations, we can prevent these types of tragedies from occurring. Congress should take up and pass sensible gun legislation as soon as possible.</paragraph>
