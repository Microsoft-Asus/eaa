  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a column by Joe Nocera from last Saturday's New York Times contains an excellent analysis of the student loan industry and the recent sale of Sallie Mae. We often hear about the rising cost of college and the debt that so many students shoulder to attend college. As this article emphasizes, the industry reaps enormous profits by forcing students to burden themselves with excessive debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent sale of Sallie Mae illustrates the problem. The company, the largest player in the industry, was purchased earlier this month by private equity firms and banks for an incredible $25 billion, 50 percent premium over Sallie Mae's stock price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Financial specialists know how profitable lenders such as Sallie Mae are because of the large Government subsidies these companies receive subsidies of more than a billion dollars last year. As Congress moves forward with reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, we must look closely at this industry and its practices to ensure that America's students are the ones being served, not just the bottom lines of America's lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Nocera, a Times' business columnist and former editorial director of Fortune magazine, is widely respected and has won numerous awards for excellence in business journalism. I believe his column will be of interest to all of us in Congress, as we consider the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and I ask unanimous consent that his article, "Sallie Mae Offers a Lesson in Cashing In," be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
