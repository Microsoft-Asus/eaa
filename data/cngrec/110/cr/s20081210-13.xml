    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise during this Christmas season to share with the Senate and the Nation an inspirational story from my home State of Montana. As a former public school teacher myself, I have known for a long time how amazing Montana's young people can be. This story is a story of triumph over tragedy that serves as the latest reminder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early on the morning of September 18, Montanans in and around Yellowstone County woke up to learn the tragic news that the Huntley Project  school in Worden, MT, was on fire--an act of arson. Despite the valiant efforts by crews from the Worden, Shepherd, Lockwood, and Billings fire departments, the school burned to the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although sad and angry about the fire, teachers, parents, students, and the whole community rallied to support the student body. As the Billings Gazette reported at the time:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Huntley Project High was still burning when people in the tight-knit community vowed that the loss wouldn't affect their spirits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Montana's Superintendent of Schools, Linda McCulloch, put out a request statewide for schools and businesses to donate school supplies and books and backpacks and computers. Montana's business community and citizens opened their hearts and their wallets, even in this tough economic time, to help these students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Billings School Superintendent Jack Copps arranged for classes to continue in the Billings school district at Skyview High School and at other facilities to help them get through the first days after the fire. Later, temporary trailers were brought to the Huntley campus to help during the rebuilding process. The 230 Huntley High School students soldiered on in the spirit of their homecoming theme--that being warriors. They simply refused to give up. I met with Superintendent Dave Mahon last month  and toured the burned campus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Huntley Project Red Devils have long been a power in Class B football. After the fire, the whole community rallied to cheer the team that symbolized Huntley's toughness in the face of an unbelievable challenge. The principal said it well: "We're red and black and we're back," as Huntley beat the Townsend Bulldogs in their first game after the fire. There would be many more victories as the team finished a perfect season with a record of 12-0. Last month, Huntley beat the powerful team from  Fairfield 41 to 28 to win the Class B State championship in football as players from both teams played their guts out and left it all out on the field. It was the first State championship for the project since 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to congratulate head coach Jay Santy, as well as assistant coaches Rick Dees, Mark Wandle, and Lenny Brown, all of the players and their parents, their teachers and friends and supporters throughout the Huntley community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America faces some tough challenges today. Last month, more than a half a million American workers lost their jobs. Many parts of the country are suffering from the foreclosure crisis in the housing market and the domestic automobile industry teeters on the brink of collapse. As we work here to tackle those tough challenges, I suggest we follow the example of perseverance of these tough young Montanans. I suggest we lace up our cleats, strap on our helmets, and go out and get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach the Christmas season, I urge the Senate to look at Huntley Project school and the greater community and look to the future with hope and grit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise in tribute to the spirit of recovery for the Huntley Project High School which was destroyed in an early morning fire on Thursday, September 18. The bottomless community spirit and immediate outpouring of support from around Montana has enabled this school, its faculty and staff, 230 students, their parents and supporters to put their energies and efforts into opening its doors. Through the extraordinary leadership of school superintendent Dave Mahon and  principal Tynie Mader, students gathered in the junior high auditorium at 8:15 a.m. on Monday, September 22, to receive school supplies and restart the school year in the wake of the fire. Classes are being held in trailers located on the practice field west of the burned high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The weekend following the fire, families and members of the community came together to clean up temporary classrooms for use, donate funds to replenish music and sports equipment, books and computers lost in the fire. Donations have come in from communities across Montana   the Malta School District sent $500 to help, having experienced a devastating fire in 1995. The school has received bandstands from Absarokee schools, cleats from a major sports corporation, backpacks from Billings elementary  schools, donations from the local banks and area businesses and offers from as far away as North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The students have taken it upon themselves to shoulder part of the burden. They have applied to the television show "Extreme Makeover" to get their school rebuilt. They have been an integral part of sorting, carrying and cleaning school equipment. And their academic and extracurricular activities are getting an extra dose of school spirit these days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The school and community rallied around the athletic teams at Huntley Project following the devastating fire. This burst of school spirit helped propel the Huntley Project Red Devils to the Montana Class B State championship in football on November 22. Huntley Project defeated Fairfield High 41-28. The victory in the State title game on the Red Devils home field capped off a perfect season for coach Jay Santy and his players. A sign on the fence encircling the field said "Devils risen up with  the flames." Indeed this statement is true of all in the Huntley Project community. The Red Devils girls volleyball team also rose to the occasion to excel this season. After being displaced from their gym due to the fire, the team was forced to practice and play all their games away from home. Despite this added challenge the squad led by</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been done. More will need to be done. But we are Montanans, and we have that frontier spirit and grit that pulls a community together without question and without hesitation in times of need. In the meantime, we are all pulling for the Huntley Project Red Devils until their school is rebuilt.</paragraph>
