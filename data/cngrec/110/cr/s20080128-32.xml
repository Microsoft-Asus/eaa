  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="Introducing S. 2561. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a theme study to identify sites and resources to commemorate and interpret the Cold War; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2561">S. 2561</bill>] Mr. President, 75 years ago yesterday, the U.S. conducted the first nuclear test on American soil--the detonation of a one-kiloton nuclear device in an area known as Frenchman Flat at the Nevada Test Site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conducted in extraordinary secrecy, this first nuclear testing program, known as Project Nutmeg, was representative of the efforts of countless Americans in the 50 year struggle we know as the Cold War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lasting half a century, the Cold War was the longest sustained conflict in U.S. history. The nuclear capabilities of our enemy posed literally an existential threat to our Nation. The threat of mass destruction left a permanent mark on American life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. prevailed over this grave threat, through the technological achievement, patriotism, and sacrifice of the people of the great State of Nevada, and of others throughout the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been 18 years since the Malta Conference that marked the end of the Cold War, yet the contributions and sacrifices of generations of Americans have largely gone unrecognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come to recognize and honor those Americans who toiled in relative obscurity to bring us victory during this most dangerous conflict in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I introduce a bill that requires the Department of the Interior to conduct a study to identify sites and resources to commemorate heroes of the Cold War, and to interpret the Cold War for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a "Cold War Advisory Committee" to oversee the inventory of Cold War sites and resources; for potential inclusion in the National Park System; as national historic landmarks; or other appropriate designations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Advisory Committee will work closely with State and local governments and local historical organizations. The Committee's starting point will be a Cold War study completed by the Secretary of Defense under the 1991 Defense Appropriations Act. Obvious Cold War sites of significance include: intercontinental ballistic missile launch sites; flight training centers;  communications and command centers, such as Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; nuclear weapons test sites, such as the Nevada Test Site; and sites of other strategic and tactical significance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps no state in the union played a more sigificant role than Nevada in winning the Cold War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nevada Test Site is a high-technology engineering marvel where the U.S. developed, tested, and perfected a nuclear deterrent that formed the cornerstone of America's security and leadership among nations. Of the 1,149 nuclear detonations conducted by U.S. as part of its nuclear testing program, 1,021 were performed at the Nevada Test Site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Naval Air Station at Fallon, NV, home of the Navy's preeminent tactical air warfare training center, was also the site of Cold War-era nuclear testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hawthorne Army Depot, formerly known as the Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant, likewise played an important role throughout the Cold War, serving as a staging area for conventional bombs, rockets, and ammunition as it had done since World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, home of the first dedicated air warfare and later air/ground training facility, provided to Cold War aviators and continues to provide advanced air combat training for U.S. and Allied forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generations of Nevadans bore and continue to bear extraordinary costs as a result of these critical contributions to the Cold War effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Advisory Committee established under this legislation will develop an interpretive handbook telling the story of the Cold War and its heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to take a moment to relate a story of one group of Cold War heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a snowy evening, November 17, 1955, a U.S. Air Force C-54 cargo plane crashed near the summit of Mount Charleston in rural Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kept secret for years, we now know that the four aircrew and ten scientists aboard the doomed aircraft were bound for the secret Air Force Flight Test Center, where they were developing a top-secret spy plane that would become known as the U-2.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These men who gave their lives that day helped build the plane that many critics said could never be built. Owing to the efforts of men like these, the critics were proved wrong: the U-2 remains a vital component of our reconnaissance forces to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of the absolute secrecy surrounding their work, the families of the men who perished on Mount Charleston only recently learned the true circumstances of the crash that  took the lives of their loved ones and the nature of their vital work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will provide $500,000 to identify historic landmarks, like the Mount Charleston crash site, to recognize and pay tribute to the sacrifices of these men and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to reiterate my thanks for Mr. Steve Ririe of Las Vegas, whose tireless efforts brought to light the events surrounding the death of these fourteen men on Mount Charleston over fifty years ago, and for the efforts of State Senator Raymond Rawson, who shepherded through the Nevada legislature a resolution honoring these heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A grateful Nation owes a debt of supreme gratitude to the silent heroes of the Cold War. I urge my colleagues to support this long-overdue tribute to the contribution and sacrifice of these Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
