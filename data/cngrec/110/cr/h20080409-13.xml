    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every day that we spend money in Iraq means missed opportunities to invest in priorities here at home. While the Bush administration spends $339 million a day in Iraq, we are diverting money from our Nation's needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that $339 million that we spend today, we could instead ensure that 2.6 million Americans have access to medical and dental care at community health centers. We can provide 955,000 families with help for their energy bills, and we could hire 50,000 more cops to protect our citizens on our streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the funds we are spending in Iraq today we could also provide 937,000 grants for research into diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes, provide 317,000 kids with vaccinations and could send 18,000 more students to school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The millions we are pumping into Iraq today is desperately needed here at home as this country stares recession in the face. Yet President Bush continues to recommend nothing but the status quo in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Put America first.</paragraph>
