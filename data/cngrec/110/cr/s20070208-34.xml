    <paragraph>Mr. President, no Member of the Senate has more experience in various levels of government than the Senator from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, who just spoke. He was a commissioner, a mayor, a lieutenant Governor, a Governor, and a Senator. Since he has come here, no Senator has spent more time on the drudgery--some Senators would say--of understanding the operations of government, how the budget decisions we make affect different parts of the Federal Government, different  parts of society, the State and local governments, and how the civil service system works, how employees are fairly treated. I salute the Senator for his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we ought to hear him carefully when he reminds us of one of the most obvious solutions to that problem, the 2-year budget. That idea has broad support in this Chamber, and it is a very simple idea. It says we will make our budget every 2 years. If we have to make adjustments in the odd year, we can do that. We already do that from time to time, but then in the intervening year, we would have plenty of time to look over our programs, make sure they work, and perhaps repeal some of them  and add some better ones and check the stacks of regulations. If you look at all of the regulations that small colleges in Ohio and Tennessee have to wade through every year, that stack is very high. I brought them down on the floor one time. Surely, we can get rid of those. On both sides of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have plenty of forces for adding laws or spending more money. We need forces for review and repeal. The people around America who elect us and depend upon us to provide the funds we provide in an orderly flow could then make their plans and spend the money more wisely. The example the Senator from Ohio gave is a good one, about the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. On this floor, what do we hear more often than anything else now? We hear let's stop the dependence upon foreign oil or at least  let's reduce it, and let's deal with global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do we do that? There are lots of different ways to try to do that, but in a country such as ours that produces and uses 25 percent of all of the energy in the world, we don't have many ways to produce large amounts of carbon-free energy; 70 percent of our carbon-free energy comes from nuclear power in the United States. So when we slow down the processing applications for new nuclear power plants--a process we invented, which our Navy used without incident since the 1950s, a process  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="1772">S1772</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was a very good example the Senator used. I salute his interest and his call for a biennial budget, a 2-year budget, and his focus on the practical problems our failure to deal with appropriations bills on time cause, and it can be shared all around the room.</paragraph>
