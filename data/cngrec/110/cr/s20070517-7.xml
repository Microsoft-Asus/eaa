    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I was shocked to read in the Washington Post that Tom Heffelfinger, the former U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota, was among those recommended for removal by the Justice Department under Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Tom Heffelfinger had previously been appointed U.S. attorney for Minnesota by the first Bush administration in 1991 and had the distinction of being appointed again in 2001 by George W. Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his second term as U.S. attorney, I had the privilege of working with Tom as a district attorney and chief prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. The relationship between the U.S. attorney and the district attorney for a large metropolitan county is a very important one but also a difficult one. I can tell my colleagues this: It has been my experience that the people of this country don't care who prosecutes a case. They don't care if it is a local attorney or a State attorney or a  Federal attorney. They just want us to get the job done. That was the spirit in which I worked with Tom Heffelfinger and his predecessor, B. Todd Jones, who was appointed by President Clinton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was first elected in 1998, B. Todd Jones had been appointed by President Clinton. Todd Jones and I forged an excellent relationship. We spoke often about the various cases in our jurisdiction and the surrounding area, and we worked together when jurisdictional lines were blurred, deciding if a case would be prosecuted federally or locally. It is not a small thing. In other jurisdictions there are often disputes that are not in the best interests of the citizens, but we were able to forge  that relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember we made a plan early on, and that is that we were going to work together. I remember when Mr. Jones and I decided we would have a party for our joint offices, and he invited the county attorney's prosecutors over to the U.S. attorneys, and I have to tell you, there is traditionally a little bit of jealousy that goes on. The county attorneys always look at the U.S. attorneys and figure they can have less cases and fewer resources to do those fewer cases, and the U.S. attorneys may look  at the county attorneys and say, oh, why can't they spend more time on a case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we decided we would bring the people together. I still remember when we had the party at their beautiful offices. I got there first, and I never told my office, but U.S. attorney Todd Jones got on the intercom, and before my office came over, he said: Nail down the furniture; The cousins are coming over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, we forged an amazing relationship. So when George W. Bush appointed Tom Heffelfinger as U.S. attorney--Tom Heffelfinger, of course, was a Republican; I was a Democrat--you might think there would be problems. Well, there weren't. Tom Heffelfinger basically ran the office the same way Todd Jones did, in a professional manner. Many of the same people continued to work there and, in fact, the chief deputy remained the same under both the Republican-appointed U.S. attorney and the Democrat-appointed  U.S. attorney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An example of Tom's professionalism comes to mind. When there was an armored truck robbery in the southern suburbs in our metropolitan area, the victim was killed execution style, kneeling next to a truck. It was a Brink's truck driver. The case had gone unsolved for a number of years. Tom came to my office. I want my colleagues to know he didn't have to do this. He could have had just a press conference and announced the charges, and that would be the end of it. But he came to my office weeks  before the case was charged to tell me he thought they were closing in on the suspect; to tell me he knew in most cases murders were handled by our office, but that this case was going to be different. It was different because the Feds had been investigating it for a number of years, and it was different because it involved an armored truck. It was also different because</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our office jointly prosecuted many cases, and when there was a jurisdictional issue, Tom and I would always talk about it. We did a number of criminally focused initiatives together. We saw our offices as partners, not as rivals, and as time went on, as the years went on, the respect between both our offices grew. As I said, each came to see each other, the people in our office, not as rivals, but as partners in justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I am so appalled that Tom Heffelfinger was targeted for firing. I take Tom at his word--and we have talked many times in the last few months--that he had made a decision to leave the office, that he never knew he was on  such a list, and he made the decision based on the fact that his wife was going to retire. But the issue is not that he made the decision on his own, the issue is that someone of such integrity as Tom Heffelfinger was ever targeted by this Justice Department for firing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always believed, as a prosecutor, you do your job without fear of favor. It may not be easy, but whatever your decisions--and you know they are not going to make everyone happy, but whatever your decisions, you want to know at the end of the day that you did the right thing and that you had no regrets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have learned these past few months that our Nation's chief law enforcement officer, our leading guardian of the rule of law in this country, has allowed politics to creep too close to the core of our legal system. This administration has determined that Washington politicians--not prosecutors out in the field, and even perhaps in some cases not the facts themselves--would dictate how prosecutions should proceed. The consequences are simply unacceptable. Good prosecutors like Tom Heffelfinger  who, by all accounts, were just doing their jobs--upholding their oaths, following the principles of their professions--we find out were targeted for firing. The new information we also received this week is while this administration repeatedly said we were only focusing on these eight prosecutors, it turned out to be 26 people who they were considering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I am asking the Justice Department today to tell us why Tom Heffelfinger, someone of such integrity, would even be on this list. I am asking our Judiciary Committee to look into the fact that this man--this good man--was even on this list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen cases all over the country now where prosecutors were pressured, where they were fired, where they were unfairly slandered by this administration. All of this, it would seem, was motivated by rank politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week was Law Enforcement Week. It made me a little melancholy for my previous job. I had many police officers come in and talk to me, so many I had known and worked with, and we talked about cases. I also treasured the work that I did with prosecutors throughout our State, from the smallest counties to the U.S. Attorney's Office. This is what our justice system is about in America. It is about putting justice first. It is about doing our jobs without fear of favor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I believe this Attorney General must resign. I have been saying it for months. You simply cannot have a cloud over the Justice Department, where they can't do their jobs because they are constantly plagued by investigations and by everything that has been going on because of the brute political decisions made by this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just wrong. I call for the resignation of this Attorney General, and I ask that the country understand what a great man Tom Heffelfinger is, that he should never have been on this list. And I will stand tall to tell the people of my State how this is a man of integrity and that I respect him very much.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, here we are once again--deja vu--debating supplemental funding for the President's disastrous misadventure in Iraq. Now in its fifth year of occupation, the U.S. death toll in Iraq is over 3,380. What a shame, shame, shame. The death toll of innocent Iraqis is largely unknown, but it probably numbers in the tens of thousands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States of America has spent over $378 billion in Iraq. Do you know how much a billion dollars is? That is $1 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. So the United States has spent over $378 billion in Iraq, and we are all familiar with the horrendous tales of waste and abuse by U.S. contractors in Iraq. The taxpayer--that is you out there--has been ravaged by the profiteering in Iraq. But even worse, despite the billions, our brave troops have been shortchanged with inadequate  equipment to protect their lives and shoddy medical care, if they make it back home, to treat wounds of the body and of the mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the President has threatened to veto the House bill, which is before the Senate, because it sets a date to withdraw, provides funding until late July and "could unreasonably burden the President's exercise of his constitutional authorities, including his authority as Commander in Chief."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has also objected to funding for rebuilding the Gulf Coast States after Hurricane Katrina, funding to improve health care for our troops and our veterans, funding for the shortfall in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, funding for Low-Income Heating Assistance Program, and more funding for Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this President--our President--has a single-minded obsession with Iraq, and he appears to see no value in anything except continuing his chaotic "mission impossible." While tilting at windmills may have been a harmless procedure for Don Quixote, Mr. Bush's war is turning the sands of Iraq blood red.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Bush raises constitutional concerns in his latest veto threat. I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. I don't no whether to laugh or to cry. I suppose one could be encouraged that constitutional concerns exist in the Bush kingdom. After setting aside the Constitution whenever convenient to justify preemptive attacks, illegal searches, secret wiretapping, clandestine military tribunals, treaty violations, kidnapping, torture, and a rejection of habeas corpus, one has to wonder about the  nature of these purported "constitutional concerns." If the Constitution is finally to be read, let us read it in its entirety, including the articles which give the people's representatives--that is us--the power over the purse--yes, the power over the purse; don't ever forget it. That is the real power. It gives the people's representatives the power over the purse and the power to declare war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its statement of administrative policy, the administration claims that the House bill before us " ..... is likely to unleash chaos in Iraq. ....." Mr. President, what do we have now if not chaos in Iraq? Securing Iraq has unaccountably morphed into securing Baghdad, and even that goal eludes us. I doubt if building a wall around the green zone is going to be of much consequence in securing Baghdad, not to mention the very strange message such a wall conveys concerning our purported liberation  of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President--our President--continues to miss the point. Iraq is at war with itself. America cannot create a stable democracy in Iraq at the point of a gun. While our troops succeeded in toppling Saddam Hussein, it is the President's profound misunderstanding of the dynamics in Iraq that have led to the failure of his Iraq policies. Why in the world should we now believe the claims that he makes in his veto threat?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There must be an end to this occupation of Iraq. Yes, I say occupation for it is no longer a war in which U.S. troops should be involved. Our troops won the war they were sent to fight, and they should not now be asked to serve as targets in a religious conflict between Sunni and Shiites that has raged for thousands of years. It is reported that even a majority in the Iraqi Parliament now supports legislation which demands a scheduled withdrawal and an immediate freeze on the number of foreign  soldiers in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April, Congress set a new course for the war in Iraq. Sadly, the President--our stubborn, uncompromising President--chose to veto that bill. As we prepare to go to conference again, the President continues--our President--to close his eyes and cover his ears to the reality in Iraq, and the urgent need for a new direction. Whatever decision is made in conference will not be the last chapter in this sad story. God willing, this Senator will not close his eyes, nor will he cover his ears, nor  will I stand by in silence. Hear me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to conclude this terrible, awful mistake that we have made in Iraq. I said in the beginning that we ought not go into Iraq. But we are there. Anti-Americanism is more robust now than in any period in our history because of Iraq. Do you hear that? The international community is skeptical--why should they not be? They are skeptical of U.S. intentions because of Iraq. Our Constitution has been trampled--hear that. Our Constitution has been trampled because of Iraq. Thousands of U.S. troops  and Iraqi citizens have lost their lives because of Iraq. Thousands more are maimed physically or mentally because of Iraq. Billions of U.S. dollars have been wasted because of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has lost all credibility. President Bush, our President, has lost all--all--credibility because of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrorism is on the rise worldwide because of Iraq. May God grant this Congress--that is, us--may God grant this Congress the courage to come together and answer the cries of a majority of the people who sent us here. Find a way to end this horrible catastrophe, this unspeakable--unspeakable--ongoing calamity called Iraq. May God help us in the United States.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I cannot support the procedure that the majority and minority leaders have concocted to speed a supplemental spending bill to conference without debate or amendments--and without even writing the actual bill. I share the desire of my colleagues to pass this important bill as soon as possible. But that is no excuse for us avoiding our responsibilities as legislators. Passing a symbolic resolution is not an acceptable alternative to writing, considering and working  to improve legislation that provides tens of billions of dollars for a broad range of programs and that addresses the most pressing issue facing the country--the President's disastrous policies in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to legislation as important as this, we need full debate and votes. We can do this quickly--I am prepared to have this debate and consider amendments right away, and to stay as long as it takes to get it done. But we should do it openly and on the record. The votes we had yesterday on Iraq amendments to an unrelated bill are no excuse for bypassing the regular legislative process today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admit, it is easier and quicker if we just send a placeholder bill to conference, so that the real work can be done there. But we do a disservice to our constituents, and to this institution, by passing the buck like that. The American people are calling on us to end the war in Iraq. They deserve to see this debate, even if it slows us down by a few hours. They deserve to know where their Senators stand, and which amendments they support. A decision about whether to continue our involvement  in this misguided war should be made in open debate, not behind closed doors--particularly since neither house will have the opportunity to amend whatever final legislation emerges from conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first supplemental that Congress recently passed was a step forward toward ending this war. I am concerned that the bill that emerges from the upcoming conference, thanks to this expedited procedure, will be a step back. Passing a weak supplemental bill that expresses disapproval of the President's policies but doesn't do anything to fix them may make some of us feel better. But this debate should not be about providing political comfort for folks here in Washington. It is about responding  to the wishes of the American people and the needs of our national security. And it should take place on the Senate floor, before the American people, right here, right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate held two important votes: one on the Feingold amendment, which called for transitioning the mission; and on the Warner amendment, which would require the President to certify the Iraqi Government is meeting benchmarks in order to receive United States aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported the Feingold amendment, which provides a real change of direction and course out of the war. I opposed the Warner amendment because, after more than 4 years of war, 3,400 American deaths, almost 30,000 wounded, and more than $500 billion--almost arriving at $1 trillion dollars in taxpayer dollars spent--we need action, not more reports, especially those without consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, while I supported one vote and opposed the other, I am encouraged by both. They show real and growing momentum on both sides of the aisle to move away from this tragic, endless war. As the Los Angeles Times reported this morning:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The votes illustrated Congress' dramatic response to public dismay with the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As CNN's Dana Bash said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a milestone in the Iraq war debate. For the first time, the vast majority of the President's fellow Republicans voted to directly challenge his Iraq policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no wonder a broad bipartisan consensus for change is emerging. We are well into the fourth surge of U.S. forces since the start of the war, yet April was one of the deadliest months in the entire war, and attacks on our troops show no sign of decreasing. The Iraqi Government has failed to adopt an oil law, a law on de-Baathification, or any further constitutional amendments they are required to implement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki is accused of sabotaging efforts of peace and stability by firing some of the top law enforcement officials for doing too good a job of combating violent Shiite militias.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conditions are so chaotic, according to a report this morning by the Chatham House Research Institute--which is a respected institute in England--they say the Iraqi Government is:</paragraph>
    <paragraph> ..... on the verge of becoming a failed state with internecine fighting and a continual struggle for power threatening the nation's very existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. mission grows further and further disconnected from our strategic national interests. Instead of focusing on force protection, hunting down al-Qaida and other terrorists, and training the Iraqi military--missions that will make us more secure, help the Iraqi people, and reduce our troops' exposure to sectarian violence--United States forces, as we speak, are patrolling Baghdad streets, extremely vulnerable to snipers, kidnappers, and these explosive devices which have become so well-known  over there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our brave fighting forces have done everything we have asked of them, and even more. Every day we debate the war, our troops remain in harm's way. The overwhelming veto-proof bipartisan majority of the Senate is now on record saying the status quo is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that reality as a backdrop, this morning we will vote for cloture on Senator Murray's sense-of-the-Senate resolution that will move us to conference on the emergency supplemental bill and the important negotiations that will take place in the near future on the Iraq situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last evening, I spoke to the father of one of the hostages in Iraq. He lives in Reno, NV. We talked, and it was difficult. He loves his son, he prays for his son's return, as we all do. We talked about how we have hope that he is alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support the resolution we are going to vote on. We can all agree we need to move swiftly to the supplemental bill that fully funds our troops. We all agree we can't "stay the course." That is not an option, as President Bush has done for more than 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move this debate to conference, the American people deserve to know that the Democrats' commitment to bring this war to a responsible end has never been stronger. If enough of our Republican colleagues decide to join with us, even the President will have to listen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my understanding the parliamentary issue before this body is a vote that will occur at 10:30; is that right?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think it would be in the best interest of the Senate if we go ahead and start the vote. I have not had an opportunity to check with the minority, so I don't want to move to do that before I do so. We will know that in a minute. But it would probably be better if we got the vote started, if there is no one here to speak in the next 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we will go ahead and start the vote, and if somebody is concerned about the extra 5 minutes, then we will extend the time an extra 5 minutes. I ask that we proceed with the vote.</paragraph>
