  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the issue at hand today is not the 23 miles of wild and scenic river in what is called the Eightmile River. It is on the use of condemnation power to create it. It is sad in this situation that staff did not decide to work in a bipartisan way to try and come up with language accommodating everybody, instead, rejected in both the Rules and Resource Committees on straight party-line votes, simple and direct language that the Republicans submitted. We asked that  it simply read that no Federal funds be used to condemn land to carry out the purpose of that act. Every Democrat, from the sponsor to the committee, said that was indeed their goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is simple language in section B. It is short; it's direct; it's understandable to any citizen, any attorney, any judge. That's what we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the Democrats gave us a convoluted bit of double talk about zoning ordinances by some date in 2005, later on perhaps, willing sellers, all in the wrong section of the code, section C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is nice, but it is a loophole. Simply because if you read, not the bill, but the act, read the entire act, you'll find that all of the language that is presented in this section, in this bill comes after this sentence in the law which says, nothing contained in this section, that covers what we're talking about and what they're talking about, nothing contained in this section shall preclude the use of condemnation. This supersedes everything in their bill. All the gobbledygook they want to  do, it supersedes it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the language to which we object, and the Democrat bill does nothing to mitigate this power of condemnation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't care if we're talking about an Eightmile River in Connecticut for Mr. Courtney or 8 miles of road in Detroit for Eminem. This is still the issue that is at hand. In the district where the State and local governments tried to take the home away from Suzette Kelo, we don't want it to be replicated again. This language has to be changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So all of us need to lose yourself in this language. Read it, for indeed our citizens will. The voters will. It is clear. This is what we need changed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the language in this bill is no different from other wild and scenic river bills that have passed both Democratic and Republican Congresses, including under the former committee chairman, the famed property rights defender, Richard Pombo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To hear opponents tell it, this bill is a threat to private property with the Federal Government waiting in the wings to condemn land. In reality, nothing of the sort would happen, and that's because opponents of the bill have persistently refused to acknowledge the clear language of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, the bill prohibits condemnation under the authority of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Then the very next sentence states: "The authority of the Secretary to acquire lands for the purpose of this Act should be limited to the acquisition by donation or acquisition with the consent of the owner."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I believe, Madam Speaker, this is an absolute, unambiguous blanket denial of condemnation authorities. We say it twice in the legislation. We don't need to say it three times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague, JOE COURTNEY, has done an outstanding job with this measure, which is supported by the entire Connecticut delegation, the Republican Governor of Connecticut, the State legislature and all of the affected local governments, and the Bush administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on this bipartisan measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>

  <chair> All time for debate has expired.</chair>
  <chair>Pursuant to House Resolution 580, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>

    <paragraph>In its current form, I am.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative> Mr. Pearce moves to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="986">H.R. 986</bill> to the Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At the end of the bill, add the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> (j) Clarification.--No Federal funds may be used to condemn land to carry out the purposes of this Act or the amendment made by subsection (b).".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  New Mexico is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his hard work on this issue. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee. We're good friends. And all three of us come from the West, where we are very familiar with public ownership of land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that really concerns us most about the threat of condemnation and about the way that home owners, private property owners would be affected is shown in this chart that I have here. The management plan would put a cap on impervious services, and those services could not be paved. If the road to your house washes out, then you simply can't do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are all sorts of takings that the Federal Government can do, and this is one, where they simply won't allow you to fix your property up or fix the roads leading to your property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So you would lose value because you could not own a house and sell a house that has a road leading to it that has washed out. You cannot add a room to your home; so feasibly we could say that we are limiting procreation. If you have another kid, you can't build a room in the back to accommodate them. You can't go build on your property if you have not already built there. You can't go in and build. The private land is impacted seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But beyond that is there a real concern? Do we have a concern for the public taking of private lands and making it theirs? Are there examples in our history as a Nation where we maybe have extended the power of a Federal Government, a central government that is too strong, a central government that begins to overburden and outweigh and out muscle the citizens? If so, then it is imperative that we give voice to those citizens who have no other voice, who have been left out completely, who are  going to be marginalized by these management plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that we do have a Federal Government that will extend too far, and I think that we have a concern here. Now, it is unfortunate that we have come to this point because the underlying bill, the one that says we would like to preserve a wild and scenic river, is one that there is almost no discussion about. The entire discussion is about private property rights, that constitutional right that gives us each our place to retreat to in the evening without the government's coming in and taking  either part of its value or simply confiscating the whole thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, confiscation is a language that seems abrupt, that seems too harsh, that we really do not face that sort of circumstance today in this country. I would tell you that, as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee last year, we heard testimony from the Franciscan Friars of Atonement in New York. That group had fought the National Park Service for decades, saying don't take our land. But through eminent domain, the Federal Park Service had continued to put pressure. Again, it was the threat  of what they could do that was used as the hammer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we find ourselves now with this bill, which the ranking member adequately points out that there is an underlying bill that contains language that nothing contained in this section shall preclude the use of condemnation. It is a process that has been used frequently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was recently in Shenandoah National Park, and you would think that Shenandoah is just a great location, and it is. But the underlying story is one that is told right now in the Visitors Center in Shenandoah, and it is about the confiscation, about moving, it seems to me, about 4,000 families out of their homes so that that could be a big park area. We did not want those inconvenient people living there; so we simply moved them out for their own good. We moved them to much better places regardless  if they wanted to move or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own State of New Mexico, the White Sands Missile Range exists there. It is 100 miles north and south and it is 40 miles east and west, 100 miles by 40 miles, and almost all of that land was taken by condemnation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Condemnation occurs when a too strong central Federal Government just wants to go ahead and move. Forget those pesky citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court recently in the Kelo decision said that governments can, in fact, take private property and redistribute it to another private firm. That is what is at stake both left and right. Both agreed in this circumstance. Liberal and conservative, Democrats and Republicans, said the Kelo decision was one of the most atrocious in taking private property rights away from people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would simply point out that private property rights are the foundation of our rights. I would urge all Members to vote for the motion to recommit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to yield to the sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412193" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have got a feeling that people in this Chamber have heard more about the Eightmile River in Connecticut than they probably ever wanted to. But I want to thank Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Rahall, intelligent, thoughtful people who understand the 10 years of hard work that has taken place in the communities of Salem, Lyme and East Haddam, Connecticut, to get to this day is worth proceeding and moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 168 rivers in this country that have been designated as Wild and Scenic, and the Federal Government has not swept in and seized property as part of this program. This is a program which is aimed at preserving water quality and species, and it is very clear in the act that the government will waive any powers of condemnation if they are satisfied that there are zoning and wetland regulations in place which will accomplish those goals. And that is exactly the situation here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These three towns have wetland regulations which have been on the books before the application for Wild and Scenic status ever took place which the Parks Department checked off on its box as adequate to achieve the goals of this program, and thus the statute specifically states that the condemnation powers shall not apply to this property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this issue came up 3 weeks ago, newspapers back home looked at it and just said the claims of the other side are just not true. And that is why the Republican Governor of the State of Connecticut, Jodi Rell; the Republican First Selectman of the Town of Lyme; the Republican First Selectman of the Town of Salem; and the Democratic First Selectman, who's a pretty good guy too, have all come out in support of this legislation because it has been a grassroots community effort, bipartisan, property  owners and public officials, to make the Eightmile River part of the family of rivers in this country which have been identified as worth preserving for our children and our grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that was drafted by nonpartisan staff follows the basic legislative format that this Congress has followed in the past for Wild and Scenic status. In fact, the prior Congress which was controlled by the Republicans, the 109th Congress, proceeded on a river designation in the State of New Jersey without any of the language which is included in the motion to recommit. If it was such a big deal, why didn't the other side, when they were in control, actually adopt that language?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, frankly, folks, we are talking about politics here and not policy. And again I want to thank Mr. Grijalva for his strong support.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, as I hear the colleagues on the other side raising the specter of massive condemnation on the part of the Federal Government, I believe that it is more of a scare tactic to divert attention, I think, about what is good in this bill because there are really no substantive grounds in which to oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twice in the legislation it is reaffirmed that condemnation is not part of the process, that there must be willing consent on the part of property owners. There is no real problem in that. The Bush administration understands it, the Republican Governor of  Connecticut understands this, the affected local communities understand this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my opinion, I think the motivation for opposition has to do with the audacity of the gentleman from Connecticut to run for office, replace an incumbent and his predecessor, and then the audacity of the voters of that district to go ahead and elect the gentleman, the sponsor of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a consensus bill. It has good support. Rather than dealing with the messenger, as we are doing today in a political basis, let's deal with the content, the substance, and the support of this legislation. And I would urge rejection of the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
