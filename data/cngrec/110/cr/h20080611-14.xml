    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, June 14, the Orange County Water District will celebrate its 75th anniversary. Along with the other members of the Orange County delegation, I introduced House Resolution 1199 to honor this significant occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Orange County Water District's 75th anniversary is particularly meaningful as it comes just months after we opened up the largest groundwater treatment replenishment system in the Nation on January 10, 2007. The replenishment system is on the cutting edge of water reuse technology. It will purify 70 million gallons of water a day, providing clean water to over 100,000 families in Orange County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vision and the initiative by the District in establishing the groundwater replenishment system is the reason it received the 2008 Clair A. Hill Award and was named the Public Water Agency of the Year in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The District is a leader in identifying and creating new and exciting options to meet the water needs of California, of the Nation and of the world, and I hope that this resolution will make its way to this House quickly.</paragraph>
