    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Denton County, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I grew up in Denton, a town where a mere 160 years ago there were more cattle than people. In fact, when my parents moved to the area in 1951, the town of Denton was a city of 20,000. Today it is well over 100,000 and the county is well over 400,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Denton is not the biggest county in America, but as long as I can remember, it is the kind of place where you knew the mayor, the local shop owners, the bank tellers, or the manager of the local grocery store. The fabric of the community was in the businesses that helped build the community and sustain life there. The same is true today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of these Denton County businesses and the Chambers of Commerce that represent them are here in Washington today. I am pleased to welcome my friends and some of the local officials to the Nation's capital. I also want to thank them for helping make Denton County a place of entrepreneurship and economic opportunity, a friendly place where people are glad to see you, and I, for one, am very glad to call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to submit the names of the Denton County delegation for the Record: Mandy Calvin, Jonathan Calvin, Gene Carey, Donald Combs, Cindi Howard, Mary Jacoby, Claude King, Matt McCormick, Stan Morton, Jody Smith, Katy Taggart, and Lori Walker.</paragraph>
