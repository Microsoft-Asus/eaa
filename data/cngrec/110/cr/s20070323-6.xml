<record where="s" when="1174665652" ordinal="6" title="CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008">
  <chair> Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, which the clerk will report.</chair>
  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Under the previous order, there will now be 30 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled between the chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, I thank the Chaplain for the most excellent prayer that he offered today. I think it set the right tone for today's discussions. I hope very much that while we may disagree strenuously, we can do so in a civil way. I thank especially the ranking member, Senator Gregg, for the way he has conducted this debate on the other side throughout. As is always the case with him, it has been thoroughly professional. It has set an excellent tone. We have vigorous  disagreements on policy from time to time, but there are many areas where we actually agree. With him in leadership, it has always been done in a professional way. We especially appreciate the cooperation from all of our colleagues and especially from the ranking member and his outstanding staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget, as it stands at this moment, takes us in a new direction. It takes us back to fiscal responsibility. It takes us toward a balanced budget by 2012. Here is where the budget stands as of the latest numbers that we have after action last night. Every year of the 5-year budget the deficits will be reduced until we are in balance in 2012, albeit just barely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next chart. The debt under the budget resolution, the gross debt of the United States as a percentage of GDP, will finally start to head down instead of increasing year after year after year.  Under this budget resolution, the gross debt of the United States as a share of GDP will start going down in 2009. We will see a slight reduction in 2010. It is somewhat improved, in terms of reduction, in 2011 and 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spending under this budget resolution is going down as a share of gross domestic product--from 20.5 percent in 2008 down to 18.8 percent in 2012. So we have spending going in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget resolution is only slightly above baseline for nondefense discretionary funding. The baseline is $438.8 billion. The spending in the 2008 budget resolution  is $445 billion, a 1.4-percent difference. That is spending in dollar terms. I was talking about spending previously as a share of GDP. The previous chart showed spending as a share of GDP actually going down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do have a number of very significant priorities addressed in this budget. First and foremost is children's health care. We have up to $50 billion allocated over 5 years for children's health care to make possible the coverage for every child who would be eligible in the country. That is 25 times as much as in the President's budget for that same period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also improved on the President's education numbers by 2008. In 2008, the budget resolution provides $62.3 billion compared to the President's budget for education of $56.2 billion for that year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another key priority is veterans health care. I am especially proud of what we have done. We have matched, or exceeded, the independent budget prepared by the Nation's veterans organizations. We have matched or exceeded it in every single category except construction, where the Veterans' Affairs Committee tells us they could not spend the amount of money in the independent budget because they simply could not let the contracts in time. In comparison to the President, we are at $43.1 billion for  veterans funded, compared to the President's number of $39.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the alternative minimum tax, the old millionaires' tax that is rapidly becoming a middle-class tax trap, we prevent the number of people being swept up into the AMT from increasing from 3.8 million last year. If we didn't take action, that would increase to over 23 million in 2007. We prevent that increase from 3.8 million to over 23 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, in 2008, we prevent an increase to over 25 million people--largely the middle class--and to the upper side of the middle class from being caught up in the alternative minimum tax. That, by the way, is completely offset. Key priorities are the child health and family tax relief amendment. There is $15 billion in the budget resolution itself for children's health care. There is up to $35 billion in a deficit-neutral reserve fund. We also now in the resolution, after the Baucus amendment,  extend middle-class tax relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We fully provide for marriage penalty tax relief, child tax credit, and the 10-percent bracket. We also provide for estate tax reform. Members will recall that we have this anomalous situation where we are going to go from $3.5 million of exemption per person under the estate tax in 2009--in 2011 it goes back to a million. We prevent that from occurring. So under the budget resolution, a couple could shield $7 million in assets without paying a penny of tax, and it is indexed for inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revenues in this resolution now, compared to the President's, are depicted on this chart. The green line is our revenues; the red line is the President's revenues. There is a difference of 1.8 percent now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seen in a different way, if you look back at what the President initially proposed for revenue, the President proposed $14.826 trillion of revenue. We have in this resolution almost the identical amount; we have $14.827 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me make clear that there is almost no difference in the revenue in this proposal compared to what the President initially proposed. Where would we get that slight difference in revenue? In the first place, there is no tax increase. We don't propose any tax increase in this budget resolution at all. I read some of the stories saying we have all these tax increases. We do not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do believe more revenue can be gained. The first place to go is the tax gap. That is the difference between what is owed and what is paid. In 2001 alone, the Internal Revenue Service tells us the tax gap was $345 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, offshore tax havens. I have shown this picture many times. There is a five-story building in the Cayman Islands that is the home to 12,748 companies. Mr. President, this is a tax dodge. There are not over 12,000 companies doing business out of this building. They are doing monkey business out of this building. They are engaged in a massive tax evasion. This is the kind of thing we ought to shut down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another committee of Congress has told us that there is $100 billion a year--over $500 billion over 5 years--being lost to the U.S. Treasury to these offshore tax haven scams. We suggest cutting that off, stopping it, recovering that revenue. In fact, that would more than cover, by a substantial amount, the revenue difference between us and what is in the President's proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another example. This is a picture of a sewer system in Europe. What does a sewer system in Europe have to do with the budget of the United States? Unfortunately, a lot because wealthy investors and companies bought this sewer system in Europe, depreciated it on the books in the United States to reduce their tax in America, and then they leased the sewer system back to the European city that built it in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are hundreds of billions of dollars involved in these tax scams. It is growing, and it is a cancer that has to be stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget resolution also makes a beginning at addressing our long-term fiscal challenges. We have $15 billion in Medicare savings. We have major program initiatives to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. We have a requirement that tax cuts and new mandatory spending be paid for with a tough pay-go provision. We have a long-term deficit increase point of order. We have a "save Social Security first" point of order. We have a health information technology reserve fund. The Rand Corporation  told us that alone could save $81 billion a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we have a comparative effectiveness reserve fund so that we go out and look at what are the most effective technologies and treatments in the medical area that work in one part of the country but have not yet been applied elsewhere. Health experts tell us massive savings could come from that initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me end as I began. This budget resolution takes us in a new direction, a better direction. This is a budget resolution which restores fiscal discipline. It will balance the books by 2012; it will meet the high-priority needs of the United States; it fully funds the President's defense request and his request for war costs; it has major tax reductions for those in the middle class so that we assure that middle-class tax breaks continue. It also provides for estate tax reform and, at the same  time, begins to address the long-term fiscal challenges facing our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't assert that this is a perfect budget. If I had a totally free hand, I am certain it would be different. But at the end of the day, the test for us is, can we write a budget for our country? In 3 of the last 5 years, there has not been a budget for the United States of America. Let me repeat that. In 3 of the last 5 years, there has not been a budget for the United States. It is our obligation and our responsibility to put a budget in place to begin the difficult task of balancing the  books while meeting the priority needs of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I begin by returning the courtesies of the chairman and doing it with sincerity. The chairman and his staff have been gracious and fair with us and, obviously, they are always professional. It is a pleasure to work with him and his staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do, obviously, have philosophical differences, but hopefully it is a reflection of how this place should work, which is we do it professionally, we don't game each other, we don't yell at each other--sometimes we yell at each other--we basically air our views, make our points, go to our votes, and allow everybody to get their 2 cents in. That is the way this place should work, and it works because the chairman is courteous enough to allow us to accomplish that. I thank him for that and his</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do agree the country needs a budget. That is critical. But regrettably, the budget he has brought forward is not a good budget for this country. It is a budget that is inconsistent in many areas, but at its essence is the fact that it spends a lot more money, grows the size of the Government, increases taxes a great deal, increases the debt a great deal and, regrettably, does not address the most essential issue we face today, which is the fiscal meltdown this country is going to face when  we put on our children the cost of the Government as we head into the retirement of the baby boom generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart reflects that situation. It is a little outdated because it was done earlier, and we don't have a chart machine like the chairman, but it essentially captures the concept that this budget has $700 billion in tax increases. That is the one number which is wrong on this chart because of the Baucus amendment being adopted--$700 billion of tax increases. That is the largest tax increase in the history of the country. There is $144 billion minimum in nondefense discretionary spending, $2  trillion of new debt, and it does nothing in the entitlement area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inconsistencies in this budget are palpable. In the tax area, for example, this budget, as I mentioned, will be the largest tax increase in the history of the country and will take us down the road toward what is essentially a European tax system where essentially we are going to be looking at a total tax burden on the American people that will head toward the tax burden of the nation of France. When this budget reaches its end, it will be about a 19-percent to 19.5-percent tax burden on  the American people. Historically, the Federal Government tax burden has been about 18.2 percent. That is a huge increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman holds up these charts which show the lines are very close between the President's tax increases and his tax increases. But his tax increases, as he says, recalculated now are about 2 percent higher than the President. Two percent is real money when you are talking a base of $3 trillion. In fact, 2 percent represents approximately a little more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in new taxes above what the President would have suggested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are huge tax increases which the American people are going to have to bear. The concept that keeps being put out here, that these are not going to be tax increases, that they are going to be found behind a curtain somewhere, is simply not defensible. It doesn't pass what I call the duck test. It is ducking the issue, basically. But it doesn't pass the duck test; that is, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and talks like a duck, it must be a duck. When you put $700 billion of new  taxes into a budget, you are talking about raising taxes dramatically, you are talking about increasing taxes on working Americans dramatically, and that is what this budget does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the pay-go area, this budget is also totally inconsistent. It says we are for pay-go. In fact, pay-go has become a solemn oath of the other side of the aisle. I read a New York Times editorial the other day that says pay-go is wonderful. Somebody tell the New York Times that the Democratic leadership, under this budget, has exempted most of their favorite programs from pay-go. They have pay-go for programs that maybe the Republican side of the aisle would support, such as not allowing taxes  to increase--yes, they apply pay-go to that issue. But when they have their programs they think are important, they don't apply pay-go to it. In fact, they specifically exempt it. For example, the agriculture language is exempted from pay-go. It looks as if SCHIP may be exempted from pay-go. The Baucus tax proposal which came to the floor was exempted</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument is that they haven't increased spending that much. Well, $144 billion in nondefense discretionary spending is a lot of money when you put it on top of the base. That is a big number. At least in New Hampshire it is a big number. I mean, $144 billion would run the State of New Hampshire for probably 20 years. Yet they claim it is not a big number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is no talk again of the inconsistency in this, there is no talk about the fact that there are over 27 reserve funds representing a $200 billion cost in new programs should they be instituted. That is a growth of the Government--which, I am sure, not all of those will be instituted, but the game plan is there to institute them--$200 billion of potential expansion in the size of the Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They take the position that they have added other programs by using the 920 account. There was an interesting debate yesterday where the chairman of the committee said to the Senator from Minnesota: We can't use 920 to address the extension of renewable tax credits relative to wind energy and issues such as that because that would cut veterans and it would cut health care and education. But he failed to mention to the Senator from Minnesota that there was already about $38 billion of the 920  account in here. Mr. President, 920 is a euphemism for, well, we really don't know how we are going to pay for this, so we are going to use the 920 account, and that is allegedly a cut across the board. So there is another $40 billion of spending in this bill that probably, in the end, is going to occur and not get paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are huge expenditures, huge expansion in the size of the Government, tremendous growth in the size of the Government in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we have entitlement accounts. The chairman of the committee continues to allege he has $15 billion in entitlement savings in this bill. That is an impossible statement to make unless you are only willing to look at one part of the bill because in the other section of the bill, they spend $50 billion in new entitlement programs. So you can't claim you are saving money when you are expanding entitlement programs and not net the two out. It is totally inconsistent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill expands entitlement spending. It does not restrict entitlement growth. Ironically, it does it in a way that makes those programs probably not subject to pay-go when they are expanded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the biggest failure of this bill. The spending is pretty bad and the taxes have improved a little, but basically this is the biggest failure of this bill, the failure to address what the chairman has talked about--I agree with his discussions, I agree with his hearings--has talked about the most severe problem we face as a nation; that is, the fact that when this baby boom generation retires, this Government becomes unaffordable for our children. The cost of three major entitlement programs--Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--will actually exceed the total Federal Government cost as a percentage of gross national product by 2025, and we will have nothing available to do anything else or, alternatively, will have to tax our children into oblivion so they cannot enjoy a quality lifestyle. Yet this bill does nothing on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We offered a reasonable amendment on this subject. We suggested that people earning more than $80,000 as individuals and $160,000 jointly should not be subsidized in their drug benefit by people working in restaurants across this country or working at gas stations or working on assembly lines, and it was rejected by the other side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We suggested that hospitals and provider groups that are getting an inflated payment under the COLA by about 1.2 percent should have that inflated COLA payment reduced by about half. They will still be getting an extra half a percent, six-tenths of a percent in benefits, and that was rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If either of those had been accepted, we would have moved toward some semblance of getting under control this outyear instability in our Medicare fund. Those two amendments would have done more to make Medicare solvent than anything else we could do around here and thus make it available to seniors when they retire and have our children able to afford it. But that was rejected. There was no action at all in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax issue--have to come back to this issue. The idea that there is not a  tax increase in this bill is so patently absurd on its face that the first amendment out of the box offered by the Democratic leadership was to extend the tax cuts for certain tax cuts they felt they didn't want to have go up, and the reverse of that, of course, is they are willing to let the other tax cuts go up. That is obvious. That is just A follows B or 1 and 1 makes 2.  So there is no question they are taxing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This idea that there is a comparison between the President's numbers and their numbers in tax increases, again is a total inconsistency. They use OMB to score the President's numbers and they use CBO to score their numbers. But if we score it apples to apples and oranges to oranges, we see the difference is significant. This was calculated before the Baucus amendment was adjusted, so these would be adjusted down somewhat, but the differences are still significant, somewhere in the range of $250  billion of difference if we compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we peel everything away from this bill--I understand we are going to start voting at 9:30--all these inconsistencies, the fact that they don't use pay-go for programs they like but they do apply to positions which the Republicans might take, the fact that the tax increase in this budget is the largest in history and yet they claim there is no tax increase, the fact that the spending goes up dramatically and they claim spending doesn't go up, the fact that there is virtually--there are no  savings in entitlements on a net basis and there is actually significant aggravation of the cost of entitlements for our children in this bill as a result of new programs which they anticipate, this bill is going to do significant damage to our economy, and it is going to grow the Government and make us larger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It comes down to a very simple fact, really, when we take everything away: This bill essentially is a classic Democratic tax-and-spend bill. That is all it is. Bigger taxes, bigger spending, bigger debt, larger Government, and as a practical matter, it is not going to be a constructive event for us as a nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope my colleagues, when we get to final passage, will vote against it. We are going to have a lot of votes here, but in the end, what is going to pass, if this bill passes, is your classic tax-and-spend bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe we are supposed to start voting at this time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, might I say the Senator now has hurt my feelings. Would the Senator's staff put up the caveman chart? That now has hurt my feelings. I don't know how I am going to be able to get through the day after the caveman chart. I don't think that is even a good likeness of the Senator from North Dakota.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>OK.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think we now need to establish the order of the votes, or at least the first several votes, and for that purpose, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the amendment be dispensed with.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be accepted.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will not object. This, frankly, is a complicated amendment. I am not sure I fully understand all the implications or ramifications of it, but the basic notion that we try to make certain that reconciliation is used for deficit reduction is one I embrace and, in fact, one that is in the budget resolution before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a requirement in this budget resolution that reconciliation only be used for deficit reduction. The amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire is an attempt to send that signal even more clearly, if I understand it correctly, and the Senator can correct me if I misinterpret it. That is my interpretation, and on that basis I would accept the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Dakota the purpose of this amendment is to make it absolutely clear we do not make reconciliation a stalking-horse to spend money. You have to use it to reduce the deficit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Maybe we should explain what the term means. Reconciliation is a special process here in the Senate that gets around the regular order. It creates a superhighway to pass something. Reconciliation was designed and implemented to permit a fast-track basis for reducing deficits. Unfortunately, it can be abused and it has been abused in the past and used to actually increase deficits. That was never the intention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have prevented that from occurring in the budget resolution. So this is an attempt to prevent something that would have minimal deficit reduction from being used as a stalking-horse for a significant expansion of spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that basis, I accept the amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, the amendment is adopted.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has an amendment, but do we have an order that indicates on every amendment that there be 2 minutes evenly divided and that there be no second degrees?</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The order is not for second degrees.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both those provisions be in order, that we have 2 minutes of debate equally divided on a vote, that there be no second degrees, that at the discretion of the managers there be the opportunity for side-by-sides, and that we order rollcall votes at this juncture on all those votes that are presented.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to offer amendment No. 601, and I encourage my colleagues to look at it and vote for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statistics are that by the year 2020 this country will be tens of thousands--tens of thousands--short on doctors providing the medical care we need around this country. What this amendment does is it creates a reserve fund that would provide additional training for physicians and help to attract more physicians in States that face a shortage of physicians for training. It does not impose a prescriptive solution but creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund the Finance Committee can use to find  the best way to help ensure citizens and States will have the number of physicians they need over the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Bill Nelson for cosponsoring the amendment, and also the majority leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee for supporting this amendment. This goes back to the mid 1990s, where there were some caps imposed. This doesn't change that, but it allows the Finance Committee the room during this budget cycle to try to help resolve that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have an amendment to the bill that creates a BRAC-type process for the rest of Government. I think this is one where we have a lot of priorities that people are interested in, yet nobody is for wasteful spending. So here is a process where we can actually reduce Federal spending in low-performing areas and be able to get the resources to spend in places we want to. It would be a BRAC-type system, which we are familiar with, and it would apply it to the rest of  Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission of reports gives us one vote, up or down, without amendment, limited timeframe. This is a way we can responsibly, both parties, look at ways we can fund priorities in the future without raising taxes, and I hope that is what we are all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are familiar with how that BRAC process works. A lot of people aren't particularly happy when the report comes out, but it has worked and eliminated some $50 billion worth of lower priority military base spending. I don't know anybody who runs for Federal office or public office anywhere who is for wasteful Government spending. Here is a way of getting at it. Because the system is built to spend, this would actually change that system to give us a process that can be fair to both sides of  the aisle, and ongoing in its effort to be able to get this allocation on a more appropriate basis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is called the Debt Reduction Appropriation Account. Currently, while all of us, on both sides, are talking about the need to cut wasteful spending and try to trim the size of Government, our appropriations process does not allow for cutting spending and using it for debt reduction. This amendment establishes a debt reduction account for every appropriations bill so if during the debate of that appropriations bill we cut something in it, it will  not be put back in the pot to be spent on something else. This account will be used for debt reduction, so if all of us have a debate about an item that should not be in a bill, it will go to debt reduction. It is a very simple debt reduction account for every appropriations bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Might I inquire from the Senator how this works? Perhaps this is something we could accept, but I need to understand how it works. Could the Senator tell me, as I looked at the amendment, on the bottom of the first page there is a blank, at least in the copy I have. It says, "For deposit of an additional amount into the account established under section 3113(d) of title 31, United States Code, to reduce the public debt"--and then there is a blank. Is that filled in on the amendment  of the Senator?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>No, it is not. There is no dollar amount although there is a dollar sign here. I will have to inquire how that ended up there, but this is not a requirement to put anything in the account. This is an account, a designated account. If an amount of money is actually cut from an appropriations bill, then it will reduce the 302(b) amount. That amount will effectively be in that account which goes to debt reduction.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am constrained to resist this amendment because, as I understand it, what it does is, if the Appropriations Committee would cut in a certain area they would then be prevented from using that money in some other perhaps higher priority area. If there were savings in one area of the budget and Homeland Security needed additional funding, they would not be able to transfer the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that basis I urge my colleagues to vote no.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield for a clarification? His explanation, I am afraid, is not the amendment. We can still do what we normally do here, which is take money from one account and put it in another. But if a Senator wishes to reduce the amount of spending in a given area and does not designate it, there is an opportunity for it to go into a debt reduction account. So if we want to take money from any account and shift it to military or Defense, there is no prohibition in this  amendment, so we do not change what we are able to do now. What we are not able to do now is, if we cut something and want that money to go to debt reduction--this amendment would simply allow, in the future, for us to designate it to an account rather than to additional spending.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, my amendment would repeal an unfair tax that affects 15 million seniors. I have brought this issue before the Chamber before, so it should be familiar to many of my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Social Security Program was created, benefits were not taxed. In 1983, Congress decided that 50 percent of the benefits to seniors should be subject to tax. In 1993, we raised the amount to 85 percent of Social Security benefits. This tax affects supposedly wealthy seniors with incomes of $34,000 for single seniors and $44,000 for a couple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is fairly simple. It creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow Congress to drop the tax back to its pre-1993 levels. This means that 85 percent of the tax would be eliminated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The amendment I offer today is critical to our National Guard and reservists serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It fixes a problem in the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Section 827 of that act allows National Guardsmen and reservists called into active duty for at least 6 months to make penalty-free early withdrawals from their IRA, 401(k), or 403(b) retirement accounts.

Funding for SCAAP is authorized in the amount of $950 million for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2011, but we have never fully funded SCAAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead we have paid only pennies on the dollar for these costs. In my home State of California, there are currently over 20,000 criminal alien inmates. It costs California approximately $715 million per year to house these aliens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, Congress appropriated $399 million for SCAAP. In this budget resolution, SCAAP is funded at $407 million.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is an important amendment. It is not related to partisan votes that we have been casting, but it is a technical amendment that amends the nature of the AMT patch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AMT patch is a huge tax reduction. It does eliminate about three-fourths of the people who would pay taxes under the AMT. My amendment is fairer. It would include 87 percent as many, but the way it would fix the AMT and give relief would be to allow families to utilize their personal exemptions and their children's exemptions under the AMT accounting. That is not done today. As a result, seven times as many families with children are caught by AMT as are single persons. It is definitely striking  at children and families. I urge that this be adopted because it is fairer, and it would reduce costs and save $82 billion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="">
    <paragraph>President, this amendment provides a fiscally sound alternative for estate tax reform. It represents a fiscally sound approach to protecting family farms, ranches, and small businesses from the onerous estate tax. It is cosponsored by Senators LINCOLN, BAUCUS, LANDRIEU, STABENOW, SALAZAR, BILL NELSON, and MARK PRYOR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment provides for an estate tax reform initiative; the necessary next step to improving the estate tax component of the B aucus amendment adopted by an overwhelming margin of 97 to 1. This amendment gets us to a $5 million exemption and a 35 percent rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the day will come when we can fully repeal the estate tax forever, but unfortunately today is not that day. Unfortunately, the fiscal realities we face do not at this time allow for a permanent solution. That is why we must adopt this amendment to provide peace of mind for thousands of families who are planning to pass their business, farm, or ranch on to the next generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the Kyl amendment, our amendment will allow us to accommodate the Landrieu proposal of a $5 million and 3 5 percent with a surcharge for the largest estates. Unlike the, Kyl amendmen t, this amendment is fiscally responsible and deficit neutral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with the cosponsors of this amendment and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact meaningful estate tax reform this session, and eventually finding a permanent solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and join me in following through on the promise made in this amendment to extend estate tax relief with an exemption of $5 million and a top rate of 35 percent.</paragraph>

We will  have the opportunity in the Finance Committee to be able to craft something that makes sense. But without what Senator Nelson and I and others are doing here, we will not  have the direction to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us know we have outlived the boundaries of the current estate tax law. We know in 2010 it may go away, but the fact is in 2011 it comes back at an old and arcane number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do is take what Senator Baucus has already done in the first amendment we voted on and adopted, and we increase it to a realistic and balanced level of a $5 million exemption and a 35-percent rate, and we do it with a reserve fund that will allow us to make sure we pay for it in a fiscally sound way when it comes through the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked diligently on this issue since I have come to the Senate, recognizing that for our small businesses, our family businesses, and our family farms this is an essential component for them to be able to be aware of how they can plan for their finances to keep those family businesses in working order.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President. I prefer not to be raising my voice, but I cannot hear myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's understand what voting for the Democrat "cover" amendment would do. First of all, when we had a $5 million exemption we were talking about last year, all of the groups came to us and said: You have to index it for inflation or pretty soon it will not mean anything. The Kyl-Thune amendment is indexed for inflation, the $5 million exempted amount. The amendment that is being proposed on the Democratic side is not indexed for inflation, and you will hear from groups such as the Farm Bureau  and the NFIB and other groups that understand it has to be indexed for inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, you say the rate is 35 percent, but there is a surcharge for "large" estates. How are they defined? They are not defined. A majority of Americans, according to surveys, say rates above 35 percent are confiscatory. So the 40-percent top rate in this Democratic proposal is going to be a big problem for a lot of Americans, both those who have to pay and those who do not have to pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, with respect to the idea this is paid for, appreciate the big expenses for estate tax are after the year 2011. So it is folly to say this is paid for. Yes, you will have raised taxes by about $60 billion to "pay" for this for the 5 years covered by the budget, but the reality is, it is not going to be paid for in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you know what. All of us--the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from Louisiana, and other Senators on the Democratic side--have in the past appreciated the fact that when it comes to death tax reform, we should not raise taxes on some taxpayers to provide this relief for the people who have to pay the death tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is, we should not have to raise money from one group of taxpayers to pay for the relief granted to this group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is probably it is going to be the same group of folks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to my friends who would want to suggest this is a "cover" amendment, that they can be just fine on this issue of death tax if they will vote for the proposal that is before us right now. That is not the case. If you want the real cover, that is to say the appreciation of the American people, reserve your aye vote for the Kyl-Thune amendment which will come next.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>There are two main differences between the amendment that was just rejected and the one which I hope we will all support. The first difference was that the $5 million exempted amount for estates was not indexed  for inflation. In the Kyl-Thune amendment, it is indexed for inflation. I think if you will all check with your folks, you will find they want this indexed for inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a little like AMT. At first it didn't hit very many people, but after awhile, it begins to hit a lot of people, primarily because of inflation. The same thing will occur here. The whole point of an exemption is so people would not have to worry about spending all the money on insurance and lawyers and accountants, and so on, to plan against the estate tax. That is why you want an exempted amount such as the $5 million, but it is important it doesn't get eroded over time. Again, one of  the key differences between the amendment that was just rejected and this amendment, which I hope you will support, is this amendment is indexed for inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, most Americans believe that a 40- or 45- or 50-percent rate is confiscatory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other difference between the amendment that just failed and the one I hope you will now support is that the maximum rate under this is 35 percent. I still think that is too high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment just agreed to had a maximum rate of 40 percent. I think 35 percent is too high, if you look at the various polls that have been taken. In any event, that is the maximum rate under this amendment. It has been supported by a bipartisan group on both sides of the aisle, which is why we sit at 35 percent, because the reality is that in order to have the estate tax reform, we are going to need a bipartisan coalition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concluding remarks are to reach out to my friends on the other side of the aisle. My final plea is that we can demonstrate in a bipartisan way by supporting this amendment, which has enough flexibility in it because it is a budget amendment rather than a specific proposal, to accommodate nuances that Members on both sides of the aisle would like to see in estate tax reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time for reform has come. Adopting this amendment will make that point in a general way. Then we can sit down and work together to try to work something out that we can get passed. I would appreciate our colleagues expressing support for death tax reform by voting aye on the Kyl amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there have been a number of statements about the previous amendments that are factually wrong. The previous amendment had a $5 million exemption per person, plus a top effective rate of 35 percent. My colleagues on the other side have misread the previous amendment. It had a top effective rate of 35 percent. I wanted to state that for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fundamental difference between the two is that the previous amendment was paid for. This amendment, by Senator Kyl, whom I respect, is not paid for. I would say to my colleagues, if this is a priority, why not pay for it? The hard reality is that if this amendment before us now is adopted--the Kyl amendment--it blows a hole in the budget, puts us back into deficit, after we have worked so hard all these hours to get a balanced budget by 2012. This proposal would put us back into  deficit by over $15 billion in 2012. It would add $35 billion to the deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. In the previous Baucus amendment, we provided for all of the middle-class tax cuts and fundamental and significant estate tax reform. It was paid for. This amendment is not. It ought to be rejected.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have offered amendment No. 508 to ensure that Congress continues to protect Medicare beneficiaries' coverage choices, especially for those living in rural areas and low-income Medicare beneficiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment establishes a budget-neutral reserve fund so that if Congress implements improvements to Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP, it may not do so in a way that leads to fewer coverage choices for Medicare beneficiaries. It also may not reduce the benefits of those beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare Advantage plans provide a range of benefits not available in traditional Medicare such as vision and dental care, physical exams, and hearing aids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare Advantage plans also have chronic care management programs to help beneficiaries with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or congestive heart failure better manage their conditions and stay healthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude by urging my colleagues to keep in mind the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beneficiaries across the Nation--whether they live in a rural State such as Utah or urban area such as New York City--now have more coverage choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These choices offer beneficiaries more benefits and lower out of pocket costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beneficiaries are satisfied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not forget that it was through policy decisions supported by Members on both sides of the aisle that helped achieve those results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And those results, in my opinion, are worth protecting for beneficiaries' sake. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an amendment to the budget resolution that Senator CHAMBLISS and I have offered to increase FY2008 funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program to $900 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for this amendment is clear. This country is currently experiencing a violent crime surge unlike anything we have seen in more than a decade. Just a few weeks ago, the Police Executive Research Forum reported that their survey of 56 cities and sheriffs' departments showed that, from 2004 to 2006, homicides increased overall by 10 percent, aggravated assaults with guns rose 10 percent, and robberies rose 12 percent. In just 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, these updated survey results mirror the FBI's own statistics, which showed that in 2005 violent crime rose in every region of the country, and by 2.5 percent overall--the largest reported increase in 15 years. For the first 6 months of 2006, the surge in violent crime was even worse--3.7 percent overall, according to the FBI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me put these numbers in human terms. The International Association of Chiefs of Police equates this 2.5 percent rise to 31,479 more victims of violent crime in 2005. And a 3.7 percent increase for all of 2006, it says, equates to about 47,000 more Americans murdered, robbed, assaulted, raped, or subjected to violent crimes last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, despite these disturbing numbers, the President's budget proposal for FY2008 continued to propose drastic cuts in the Federal assistance traditionally available to State and local law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen to the warning cry that the International Association of Chiefs of Police recently issued:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[T]he cuts contained in the proposed FY 2008 budget have the potential to cripple the capabilities of law enforcement agencies nationwide and force many departments to take officers off the streets, leading to more crime and violence in our hometowns and, ultimately, less security for our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are strong words, but they make sense in the wake of the drastic Federal cuts we have seen to State and local law enforcement, especially in the last few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In FY2007, the total funding level for State, tribal and local law enforcement assistance was $2.316 billion. That was already more than $1.5 billion below the level given only 5 years earlier, when DOJ funded programs for state and local law enforcement totaled $3.831 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year's $2.316 billion amount included not only Byrne/JAG, but also the COPS program and 17 other State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance grant programs, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP; Tribal Courts Initiative, and other programs to promote Drug Courts, Prescription Drug Monitoring, Cannabis Eradication, and State and Local Intelligence Capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For FY2008, however, the President remarkably proposed to eliminate all 17 of these programs. In their place, it proposed only two consolidated programs, one of which would be called the Byrne Public Safety Program, or BPSP. Unfortunately, even when BPSP was combined with the President's other proposed programs, its total budgeted amount for FY2008 was only $582 million--a $1.7 billion cut from the already-depleted FY2007 number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the President's budgeted $582 million represented an 85 percent cut in these funds in just 6 years. And to make matters worse, the President's FY2008 budget also proposed more than $500 million in cuts to the DHS grant programs traditionally available to State and local law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 1990s and earlier years in this decade, our Federal Government vigorously funded grants programs for State and local law enforcement. And we saw results--violent crime went down year after year. But with the recent cuts, violent crime rates have now turned back up. Literally tens of thousands of additional Americans each year have become victims of violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for the Senate to add substantial Byrne/JAG funding to this year's budget resolution--just as we have done in the past 2 years. In FY2006 and again in FY2007, this Senate voted to increase Byrne/JAG to $900 million--even after President Bush and previous Budget Committees tried to "zero out" this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize and appreciate that Senator CONRAD and his Budget Committee in the new Congress have taken a very different view of Byrne/JAG. I applaud their decision to reject the much smaller budget figure for Byrne/JAG that was contained in the President's Budget, as well as the decision to reject the President's proposal to consolidate Byrne/JAG with other grant programs and eliminate its formula funding. This is a major step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, however, it just is not enough. At a time when this country is seeing the biggest surge in violent crime it has experienced in more than a decade, using FY2007 levels that are $1.5 billion below FY2002 levels will not do the trick. The Senate must do more--just as we rose to the occasion and voted to do more in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a Byrne/JAG amendment was offered on the budget resolution last year, we were confronted in June with the sharply higher 2005 violent crime numbers reported by the FBI. And in December, the FBI gave us even worse violent crime numbers for the first half of 2006. Given these disturbing trends, the Senate needs to restore these needed funds to the Byrne/JAG program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that this budget is tight, and I appreciate the difficult tradeoffs involved. But at a time when  we are about to consider a Supplemental Appropriations bill that may add more than $100 billion so that we can try to secure the streets of Baghdad against violence, I do not think that it's asking too much for us to spend the funds we need to secure our own streets from the violence that the FBI says we are increasingly seeing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homeland security is undoubtedly important, but so is home town security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Byrne/JAG program, named after slain New York Police Officer Edward Byrne, is a time-tested program run by DOJ that has proven its effectiveness over the course of more than 20 years. It is a key source of funding for multi-jurisdictional task forces. And because 40 percent of a State's Byrne/JAG funds must be set aside for local governments, smaller and rural law enforcement agencies are often especially dependent on Byrne/JAG to meet their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increased funding for Byrne/JAG has been endorsed by a wide array of law enforcement groups, and I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for supporting the amendment Senator Snowe and I offered to provide an additional $97 million to the Small Business Administration. This amendment was necessary because the President's budget request of $464 million was inadequate to fund the agency's core programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, unfortunately, is nothing new. Since the President took office in 2001, he has cut the SBA, the only Federal agency dedicated to the startup and growth of small businesses, more than any other agency. If we exclude disaster loan funding, the President has cut the SBA by more than 30 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of the President's cuts, SBA's loans and venture capital are more expensive, shifting more than $100 million in fees to the small business community, businesses are getting less counseling, and they are losing out on opportunities to do business with the Federal Government, a very serious problem since the Federal Government spends about $370 billion on contracting for services and goods each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consequently, the baseline funding for the SBA is so low that it has made it very hard for Congress to reverse the President's cuts. Nevertheless, Senator Conrad and his Committee were able to increase by $635 million the account--referred to as function 370--that provides funding for the SBA and other agencies. I congratulate them, and thank them. They have demonstrated that it is possible to provide reasonable funding for effective initiatives and still put the country back on track  to a balanced budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the most disturbing proposed cuts to the SBA in fiscal year 2008, the President has for the fourth year in a row eliminated all funding for the Microloan program and for Microloan Technical Assistance. This is very hard to justify given that the administration is willing to spend so much on micro-credit in other countries. In 2005, the administration provided approximately $211 million for the development of foreign microenterprise programs through the Agency for International Development.  In fiscal year 2006, we are told by Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, that the administration provided more than $54 million for microloans in Iraq. And for fiscal year 2007, the administration has requested supplemental funding for Iraq that includes at least $160 million for micro-credit programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment restores the Microloan and Microloan technical assistance programs to the levels they were at in 2001--$3.2 million to leverage $30 million in loans and $20 million in technical assistance. Our amendment also restores the proposed cuts to the Women's Business Centers, the Small Business Development Centers, the Office of Veterans Business Development, and programs for the development of minority businesses and Native Americans. It restores $10 million in funding for the New Markets  programs, which have never received support from this administration, in spite of claims about targeting areas of high unemployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My one big regret is that this amendment does not provide funding for the 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program. My original budget amendment, No. 515, did include $79 million in order to reduce fees on borrowers and lenders, which could have gone a long way to making these loans more affordable. Right now, on the largest loans, borrowers are paying around $50,000 in fees when a conventional loan would only cost around $20,000 in fees. We need to get that cost down. I am very disappointed that the Republican  leadership would not allow any funding for the 7(a) loans to be included in our amendment. I am hopeful that Senator Snowe and I, with our colleagues in the House, can continue to work on this and get funding for fee relief during the appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from that one disappointment, I am very pleased with our amendment. It is reasonable and realistic. By restoring $97 million to the SBA, we bring its funding for fiscal year 2008 to $561 million. This is still $125 million--or 18 percent--less than SBA's funding in fiscal year 2001, and it is a fraction of the $2.9 trillion budget President Bush proposed for fiscal year 2008, but it will go a long way to fostering small business growth and sparking innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Snowe and our colleagues Senators Lieberman, Enzi, Cantwell, and Pryor for joining in this bipartisan effort.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise to draw attention to funding for our Nation's small businesses, which has systematically declined over the last 6 years and is inadequate in both the President's budget and this budget resolution before us. I first commend my colleage, Senator Kerry, for working with me on this bipartisan amendment to restore this critical funding for small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would restore $97 million in funding to the Small Business Administration, an agency that contributes substantially to our economic growth. Since 2001 the SBA's overall budget has declined by an unacceptable 31 percent. Especially when one considers that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, breathing life into areas once devastated by manufacturing closures, disasters, and economic recessions, it is frankly beyond me why we continue to shrink the resources that actually  help our Nation's job creators grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month, I heard firsthand from over 90 Maine small business manufacturers about the barriers that hinder their success and the programs that have helped manufacturers grow and expand their business like the SBA's 504, 7(a), SBDC and HUBZone programs. However, this budget falls short of providing the very programs that have helped revitalize Maine's and our Nation's communities devastated by over 20,700 manufacturing job losses since 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is about the 25.8 million small businesses and small manufacturers across the country, which are vital to the economic growth and job  creation in each of our States. In every State, small businesses are the engine that drives our economy. Small businesses use SBA loans to expand and hire new workers; they receive vital advice from Women's Business Centers, Small Business Development Centers, and Veterans Business Development Centers; and they survive and thrive by obtaining contracts with the Federal Government. These are the people and the businesses my amendment assists. So why does this budget handcuff the very programs  that have allowed our businesses and economy to expand?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SBA has helped create and retain over 5.3 million jobs since 1999. It is clear that our economic future depends on the success of small firms, which constitute over 98 percent of our Nation's manufacturing enterprises, create nearly three-quarters of new jobs, and produce 50 percent of the gross domestic product. However, we cannot, on the one hand, state how much we value small businesses, and on the other hand, neglect to provide the assistance that small businesses so desperately need  to compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan amendment provides funds for the SBA's Microloan Program, which provides loans of up to $35,000 and technical assistance to new and growing small businesses. The administration proposes to eliminate the  subsidy for microloans and transfer the technical assistance duties to the entrepreneurial development programs. However, this relatively inexpensive program is critical to our next generation of entrepreneurs. In fact, in my own State  of Maine, the Microloan Program has made 94 loans over the last 2 years, for a total of $1.7 million. The elimination of this subsidy will increase interest rates for our Nation's microlenders and micro-entrepreneurs located in rural and underserved communities that have no other resource for financing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this amendment provides the critical funding for Small Business Development Centers, SCORE and Women's Business Centers, which served over 1.2 million clients in 2006. Not only has funding for these programs decreased over the last 5 years but the SBA proposes to increase their  responsibility to take on microloan technical assistance. These critical programs need and, quite frankly, deserve the resources to reach and assist more small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, this amendment provides the resources necessary for our small businesses to access prime contracting and subcontracting opportunities. The SBA has failed to fix regulatory loopholes identified by the GAO that allows large contractors to keep small business set-asides. To address a contracting market that has increased to nearly $400 billion a year, the SBA budget needs to increase its resources and provide proper oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to point out the irony that the administration's budget supports and funds microloans and assistance for foreign microenterprises, but eliminates, yes, eliminates, all funding for domestic microloans and assistance for American microenterprises. While I fully support aid and assistance to foreign microenterprises, what are we saying with this imbalance? Is this fair? Is this the message we want to send to our Nation's small businesses?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we justify repeated cuts in funding for loans and assistance here at home? Is this our priority? I think it is not, and this amendment reflects our priorities and our commitment to American small businesses. The $97 million provided for here would make a significant difference to our job-creating small firms and helps them grow, flourish and thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is absolutely necessary for America's small businesses and is an investment in the entrepreneurship and future of this country. I urge my colleagues to support it for the SBA and our small business job creators. If we fail to provide sufficient support to SBA's core lending and business development programs, we threaten to reduce small businesses' ability to compete. The American economy needs a strong and vibrant Small Business Administration.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400357" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the amendment the majority leader and I are offering today is the first step in our effort this Congress to undo a fundamental unfairness that affects over 300,000 disabled veterans in this country who also happen to be military retirees. In short, this amendment creates a reserve fund that will allow this Congress to once and for all eliminate the offset that exists between military retiree pay and VA disability benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when we have men and women in harm's way in Iraq, Afghanistan and in other locations around the globe, it is appropriate that the budget resolution we pass out of the United States Senate acknowledge and seriously address the unmet needs of our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is wrong that our veterans are enduring long waiting lines to receive health care from the VA due to inadequate funding. It is wrong that the Bush administration slammed the doors of the VA health care system on hundreds of thousands of so-called "higher income" veterans--veterans who in reality make as little as $28,000 a year. And it is wrong for this administration to try to impose higher copayments and enrollment fees on our veterans. As someone who sits on both the Budget Committee  and the Veterans Affairs Committee, I am incredibly proud that on all these issues, this budget resolution is on the side of veterans and rejects administration proposals that short-change and nickel and dime those who have served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The scandal at Walter Reed has highlighted that even here in Washington, only a short distance from this chamber, some of our servicemembers were living in sub-standard conditions with moldy walls, rodents, and holes in the ceilings. Thankfully, this budget resolution also addresses this outrage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this budget resolution also provides for substantial, new investments in mental health services for our veterans to help us treat the thousands of veterans returning from the Iraq War with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD. Also this budget resolution recognizes that we need to significantly increase funding to treat the large number of servicemembers returning with traumatic brain injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this budget resolution includes an amendment I added in committee that will allow us to make other important improvements to veterans' programs later this year. In short, the budget resolution we are considering is a huge step in the right direction when it comes to veterans' health care and benefits. Chairman Conrad and his staff deserve tremendous credit for recognizing the very serious needs of our veterans and moving boldly to address them. I also want to commend Chairman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with the tremendous strides forward we have made for veterans in this budget resolution there is one additional issue that needs to be addressed. Today, Senator Reid and I are offering this amendment to take care of that very important issue. Before getting into the details first let me start off by saying that I am honored to be working with the majority leader on this issue. I know that, year after year, he has been the leading voice in the Senate to eliminate the Disabled Veterans  Tax. And today, he continues that leadership with this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would create a reserve fund to allow for the elimination of the remaining offset between military retiree pay and VA disability payments. In my view, this is an issue of basic fairness. Military retirees earned their retiree pay based on their long-term service to the Nation. They earn their VA disability benefits based on the disability they acquire or aggravate in the service of their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current offset between these separately-earned benefits originates from a 19th century law that required a dollar-for-dollar offset of military retired pay for VA disability compensation. In my view and the view of millions of veterans across the country, it is clear that veterans deserve to receive both their military retirement which they receive for their service and their VA disability payments as additional compensation for the injuries and lost earning power due to their service-connected  disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me provide just a bit of background on some of the progress Congress has made on this issue in recent years, thanks in large part to the work of Senator Reid. In the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense Authorization, Congress created a special benefit called "combat-related special compensation" or CRSC. It expanded it in the fiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization. CRSC gives certain combat disabled veterans a cash benefit equivalent to what they would receive if full concurrent  receipt were allowed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization bill, Congress approved phasing-in concurrent receipt for military retirees rated as at least 50 percent disabled. The fiscal year 2005 DoD Authorization ended the phase in for 100 percent disabled veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, today we find ourselves in a situation where retirees who are less than 50 percent disabled are getting no relief from the Disabled Veterans Tax and veterans at least 50 percent disabled but less than 100 percent disabled are in the middle of the phase period that will not be complete until 2014. Frankly, if Congress has made the determination that the ban on concurrent receipt of military retiree pay and VA disability compensation is wrong--and I think the legislation passed so far demonstrates  that Congress has made that determination--there is no excuse for making veterans wait for the benefits that we have acknowledged they are due. Now is the time--once and for all--we need to eliminate the disabled veterans tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Reid-Sanders amendment is just one important step we need to take to  keep faith to the promises we made to our veterans. I look forward to working with the majority leader on this issue as it moves through the legislative process and I would ask that my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, very quickly, this is a very simple vote, actually. What it has to do with is limiting the amount of additions that can be put on supplementals that are designed for Defense spending. The amendment I am offering would attempt to bring some discipline back into the emergency spending process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It simply holds to a supplemental those things that a supplemental was designed for. The very nature of emergency spending is above and beyond the approved budget. If we want to control spending and control the deficit, then we need to control what we put on these kinds of supplemental bills we are seeing worked out right as we speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, too often the emergency supplementals are larded with all kinds of pet projects and spending that Members cannot pass in the regular process or others put it in there to get theirs passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an abuse of the process. We are going to end up holding our troops hostage because of extraneous spending. I ask that Members support the amendment, that we hold spending in the supplemental to the military for which it is designed.</paragraph>

So it is not even working and hitting the people it is supposed to hit. Right now, this year, 2007, the year we are in, there are 23 million families that are going to be hit by this tax. It is a phony revenue machine, over 5 years, $467 billion dollars. We are going to have to have a point of order this year to keep these 23 million taxpayers from paying this tax.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment reinstates the COPS Program. I remind everyone, when the COPS Program was functioning, violent crime in America reduced 8.5 percent a year for 7 years in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, throughout the 1990s, we funded the COPS Program at roughly $1.2 billion, and it drove down crime. Now crime is rising again. In every one of our States it is up. Violent crime is up across the board. The Police Investigative Research Forum released a report which found that murders were up 10.6 percent in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The COPS Program in the crime bill worked, and the Government Accounting Office found a statistical link between the COPS grants and a reduction in crime. The Brookings Institution reported the COPS Program is one of the most cost-effective programs we have ever had in this country. Local officials urgently need this support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the COPS Program has some history here. It was started by President Clinton. His position was, and he asked for, 100,000 police officers. He said that when we got to 100,000, the program would stop. We got to 110,000 police officers and the program continues on and on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program should have ended 5 years ago or 6 years ago, but it continues. It is similar to so many Federal programs that get constituencies that go on well past what their original purpose was. It may be well intentioned, but we cannot afford it and we shouldn't continue it. It was never thought it would be continued this long.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment really is symbolic of a lot of the things we are trying to work on.

    <paragraph>My amendment is very simple. It gives Members a chance to go on record about supporting States' flexibility in Medicaid which Congress provided under the Deficit Reduction Act. My State and several others have already used this flexibility to improve their Medicaid programs. A vote for my amendment supports allowing States to designate benefits that fit the specific needs of their State and population. A vote against it is support of a one-size-fits-all model for Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people have tried to say this amendment tries to undercut the mandatory child care benefits under Medicaid. That is not true and could not be further from the truth. In fact, the amendment we are voting on clarifies that legislation could not alter Medicaid's mandatory coverage benefits for children.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to lend my support to the Bunning amendment No. 594.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, we gave the States the ability to create flexible benefit plans. Section 6044 of the Deficit Reduction Act established a new section 1937 in title XIX, which allows States the option to provide a benefit package that meets a benchmark standard or benchmark equivalent standard of coverage for certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Under this section, States are required to provide Early and Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment, EPSDT, services to children  enrolled in benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, section 1937(a)(1)(A) contained two related provisions. First, section 1937(a)(1)(A)(i), provides that States choosing to provide coverage under this section must provide benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage in the case of beneficiaries for whom a benchmark is an option. Second, section 1937(a)(1)(A)(ii), provides that in the case of children under age 19 receiving benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage, States must cover "wraparound" benefits to the  benchmark  coverage or benchmark equivalent coverage consisting of EPSDT services and benefits specified in section 1905(r). In other words, an EPSDT "wraparound" consisting of all benefits and services enumerated in section 1905(r) is a requirement for States electing the benchmark option or benchmark equivalent coverage. The use</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 31, 2006, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, issued guidance to states in a Dear State Medicaid Director letter on the implementation of the benchmark coverage. The CMS letter stated the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individuals under age 19 who are covered under the State plan under section 1902(a)(10)(A) of the Act must receive wrap-around benefits to the benchmark, or benchmark-equivalent plan, consisting of early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) services defined in section 1905(r). Wrap-around benefits must be sufficient so that, in combination with the benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefits package, these individuals receive the full EPSDT benefit. The State plan must include  a description of how wrap-around benefits or additional services will be provided to ensure that these beneficiaries receive full EPSDT services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my belief that the requirement of the provision of ESPDT to all children receiving benefits through a benchmark benefit package is a settled issue, both as a matter of law and of implementation of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Giving States the ability to design benefit packages that are appropriate to the people receiving the benefits is key to Medicaid's future. The purpose of this important provision is to free States from a one-size-fits-all approach to Medicaid. Several States, including Kentucky, West Virginia, Idaho and Kansas, are taking the lead with these innovative plans to cover Medicaid recipients. We should resist any effort to limit the ability of the States to develop and implement these flexible, benchmark  benefit plans. This flexibility will strengthen the long-term viability of the Medicaid Program and thereby protects coverage for low income children, pregnant women and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A vote against the Bunning amendment is a vote against the tools that States desperately need to manage their Medicaid Program. To me, the vote here is obvious. Vote to protect the Medicaid Program and state flexibility in Medicaid. Vote to protect the EPSDT benefit for children. Vote for the Bunning amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment does undermine the basis of Medicaid today, which is "medically necessary services." The effect of this amendment is to allow States to lower health care coverage for low-income kids. That is the effect of this amendment. Why do States want more flexibility, especially with respect to this program? So basically they can lower benefits. They can save money. There has been a longstanding principle under Medicaid that Medicaid should provide medically  necessary services, such as immunizations or checkups, to low-income kids, and that is the basis. We have to keep it. The effect of this amendment is to undermine that. If we stand for anything here, it is making sure low-income kids do not have less health care benefits, at least. They should have more. This amendment would undermine that and allow States to have lower benefits for kids, and for that reason it should be rejected.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment would repeal the 1993 AMT tax increase that generally increased the AMT rates from 24 percent to a two-tiered 26 and 28 percent. This is one last opportunity on this resolution to correct the mistake we made in 1993, which began in 1969 with the so-called alternative minimum tax. This was the guarantee that the wealthy paid their fair share, ostensibly, but it has morphed into a terrible tax on the middle class. This is not a full repeal like the earlier  amendment. This is the one that actually addresses the problem we created in 1993, the creeping rate increase that went from 24 to 26 percent.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take a moment to explain why I offered an amendment with Senator SMITH to increase the international affairs budget. Prior to the Budget Committee's consideration of the 2008 international affairs budget, Senator SMITH and I, along with many of our colleagues on both side of the aisle, circulated a letter to the Budget Committee asking for a significant increase in the international affairs budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel very strongly that given the myriad challenges facing the United States around the world, the international affairs budget needs be more robustly funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, this budget supports the people and programs devoted to strengthening alliances, promoting peaceful relationships among nations, boosting economic development, eliminating poverty, and explaining and representing U.S. policy abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues also know, the international affairs budget constitutes just over 1 percent of Federal spending, yet it funds some of the most essential components of America's foreign policy, including our diplomatic service, foreign aid, international health programs, and emergency relief operations among others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The international affairs budget provides the funding for the most important tools we have to implement our foreign policy. Robust funding is necessary to implement these critical programs and policies to fund American diplomacy and global development, so that we can continue to expand our leadership in the fight for freedom, prosperity and peace throughout the world.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to vote for this budget resolution today. I believe this blueprint for the government's spending and revenues will help put us back on a fiscally responsible path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I turn to the merits of this resolution, I want to address the fact that my amendment to establish a deficit neutral reserve fund to promote American manufacturing has been included in this resolution. I thank Senators CONRAD and GREGG for accepting this amendment, and I look forward to working with them and other Members to carry out its intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we must take strong and dramatic actions in this Congress to revitalize and support our domestic manufacturing sector. We need to enhance our research and development programs, provide tax incentives to encourage and sustain domestic manufacturing, and level the playing field for our domestic manufacturers in the global marketplace. My amendment will be helpful as we fight in this Congress to take these important steps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to stop the hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs from the United States. Our economy and well-being are directly linked to the health of our manufacturing sector, yet we continue to lose manufacturing jobs in this country. Since 2001, we have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs nationwide--including more than 200,000 in my home State of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions more manufacturing jobs hang in the balance. Our companies face enormous pressure in competing in the global marketplace without sufficient support from the U.S. government. Our companies are not competing against other companies overseas--they are competing against other governments that strongly support their manufacturing sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to provide significant federal support for technology initiatives and advances that will help keep our companies on the cutting edge of technology development and competitive in the global marketplace. All of this requires a bold and comprehensive effort across many segments of our federal government. It will involve many committees and many federal agencies, but I believe it is critical to stem the tide of the domestic manufacturing crisis occurring in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment points us in the direction we need to take. It will support legislation that would revitalize our domestic manufacturing sector in four critical ways--by increasing Federal research and development; by expanding the scope and effectiveness of manufacturing programs across the Federal Government; basing support for development of alternative fuels and leap-ahead automotive and energy technologies; and by establishing tax incentives to encourage the continued production in the U.S.  of advanced technologies and the infrastructure to support them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many other parts of this resolution to be pleased with as well. For too long now we have been digging deeper and deeper into a ditch of debt. President Bush's budget submitted to Congress in February would continue that trend by increasing the gross Federal debt by nearly $3 trillion to $11.5 trillion by 2012. That's $38,000 per person. The budget resolution we are considering today should start to reverse that trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this resolution reestablishes a strong pay-go rule, which would require any new spending or tax cuts to be paid for elsewhere in the budget or receive a supermajority of at least 60 votes in the Senate. This concept is common sense for most families, who work to live within their means by balancing what goes out with what comes in. I heartily welcome its return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget also takes the positive steps of establishing a new budget point of order against long-term deficit increases and allowing the Senate's unique budget reconciliation process, which was abused in recent years by the Republican majority, to be used for deficit reduction only, not to increase the deficit with measures which otherwise could not pass the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget also sets a blueprint for going after our country's massive $350 billion tax gap, which is the difference between the amount of taxes owed by  taxpayers and the amount collected. One of the primary tax gap areas I hope Congress will focus on this year is the offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses that are undermining the integrity of our tax system. There are many ways Congress can go about tackling these problems, and I commend Chairman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I am pleased that this budget assumes an extension of alternative minimum tax, AMT, relief for 2 years. This is relief we know is needed to avoid imposing this unintended tax increase on millions of middle income families. This time frame gives the Finance Committee time to work out a fix that is appropriate and, I hope, paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two AMT amendments offered to this resolution which we considered today were not paid for. The amendment offered by Senator Lott would add $231 billion to the debt over the next 5 years, and Senator Grassley's amendment would have cost $533 billion over that same time. We must not only fix AMT, we must fix it responsibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, I am pleased that this budget resolution supports our men and women in uniform by providing all the funding requested by the President for national defense, for both the underlying national defense program and the additional costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe our policy in Iraq must change, but I do not support attempts to cut off funds for our troops in the field. This resolution fully funds our forces at home and overseas, at the levels I and Senator McCain,  the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, requested in our letter to the Budget Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe funding for these ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan should be accounted for in our budget, and that it was past time the President and Congress stop treating these costs as if they were unanticipated "emergency" expenditures. I am pleased that this resolution supports the request Senator McCain and I made to build these costs into the budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has two beneficial effects. First, it makes this budget more honest about the cost of this war and the impact it has on our federal deficit. Second, putting this spending into the regular budget process helps ensure that funding requested for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will receive greater congressional oversight. I commend Senator Conrad for his continuing leadership on fiscal responsibility and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of funding for our Nation's veterans, I am pleased that this resolution includes the resources needed to ensure that our veterans get the health care they deserve. In total, the resolution provides more than $43 billion for the Veterans Affairs healthcare system--$3.5 billion more than President Bush's budget. Again, this year, the Senate has rejected President Bush's proposal to raise copayments and to impose new fees and higher copayments on certain veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that this budget affirms the Senate's commitment to authorize at an appropriate level the Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, before it expires in September 2007. Making sure children have adequate health care should be one of our nation's top priorities. However, President Bush's budget would lead to the loss of critical coverage in many states. It is imperative that we reject that inadequate proposal, and this budget resolution does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget also represents a significant improvement over the President's budget for education. There are more funds for Pell grants, IDEA, and No Child Left Behind Act than the President requested. It would be shameful to fail in our responsibility to our children to adopt a spending blueprint that does not provide our schools the resources they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that this budget rejects the broad array of cuts to environmental protection programs that were included in the President's budget. This budget resolution fully funds the Environmental Protection Agency's programs to support clean and safe drinking water, and increases funding for the Superfund program by $211 million over the level in the President's budget. The budget also provides about $900 million more for the EPA than the President's budget. This bill also protects Federal  lands by rejecting President Bush's proposal to assume revenues from proposals to sell Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also heartened that the budget rejects the President's proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, I also support the Senate's adoption of an amendment to fund the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, at $3.2 billion, which will ensure that more households can be served by this very important program. Unfortunately, this program has been woefully underfunded by President Bush's budget, as well as in past years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to talk a bit about a couple more of the amendments we voted on today. I support extending tax cuts for low- and middle-income taxpayers. However, I opposed Senator Graham's amendment because it would have extended the excessive tax cuts for those in the highest income bracket which I have opposed from the first time we voted on it in 2001, and which we simply can't afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also opposed an estate tax amendment offered by Senator Ben Nelson. I would support legislation to prevent a return to the 2001 exemption level, which is too low and no longer appropriate. The current law estate tax exemption level for 2009 of $3.5 million, $7 million for couples, is appropriate and results in only one-third of one percent of estates owing any estate tax. I also had concerns about the Nelson amendment because it proposed a reduction of the rate to 35 percent, which  would be a huge loss to the treasury and the amendment does not specify how the revenue needed to keep these changes from increasing the deficit would be raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a welcome change to be voting for a budget resolution that I believe can change the failed fiscal policies and irresponsible tax cuts pushed by this administration. This resolution paves the way for important investments in America's future to put our country back on track and to begin the long process of climbing out of the ditch of debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, during this budget debate there have been different views expressed regarding the amount of revenue that would result if Congress will go after the offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses that are undermining the integrity of our tax system. There are many ways Congress can go about tackling these problems, and I commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for their willingness to take on and push Congress to address these complicated areas. Cracking down on these  abuses is a critical step toward achieving fairness in our tax system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress addresses these inequities, it would also bring in billions of dollars needed to pay for many important national priorities. These priorities are recognized in this budget resolution itself, such as education, children's health care, veterans medical care, community development block grants, and law enforcement. We can go a long way toward paying for these critical programs by stopping these tax dodges that rob the Treasury of up to $100 billion a year, and shift the tax burden from  high-income persons and companies who are principal users of offshore tax havens onto the backs of middle-income families who pay their taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, of which I am chairman, has been looking at the problem of offshore corporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws and practices that help taxpayers dodge their U.S. tax obligations by preventing U.S. tax authorities from gaining access to key financial and beneficial ownership information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subcommittee has also spent years looking at abusive tax shelters, which are complicated transactions promoted to provide tax benefits unintended by the Tax Code. They are very different from legitimate tax shelters, such as deducting the interest paid on home mortgages or congressionally approved tax deductions for building affordable housing. Some abusive tax  shelters involve complicated domestic transactions; others make use of offshore shenanigans.  All abusive tax shelters are marked by one characteristic: no real economic or business rationale other than tax avoidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to talk briefly about what we found during those investigations. I think the specifics help make clear that if we have the political will, these are areas ripe with abuses that we can put an end to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Offshore Investigation. During its year long investigation into offshore tax haven abuses, the subcommittee issued more than 70 subpoenas, conducted more than 80 interviews, and reviewed more than 2 million pages of documents. In the resulting hearing held in August 2006, the subcommittee showed through case studies that offshore tax haven countries have, in effect, declared economic war on honest U.S. taxpayers by giving tax dodgers a way to avoid their U.S. tax bills and leave them for others  to pay. Offshore tax havens attract these tax dodgers by shrouding their financial transactions in a "black box" of secrecy that is extremely difficult to penetrate. They sell secrecy to attract customers and reward them with low or no taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legal black box allows tax dodgers to hide assets, mask who controls them, and obscure how their assets are used. An army of "offshore service providers" lawyers, bankers, brokers, and others then joins forces to exploit the impenetrable curtain of secrecy and help clients skirt U.S. tax, securities, and antimoney laundering laws. Many of the firms concocting or facilitating these schemes are respected names here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These schemes require the secrecy of tax havens because they can't stand the light of day. Our investigation laid out six case studies that illustrated the scope and seriousness of the problem. In one case, two U.S. citizens moved about $190 million in untaxed stock option compensation offshore to a complex array of 58 offshore trusts and corporations and utilized a wide range of offshore mechanisms to exercise direction over these assets and hundreds of millions of dollars in investment gains.  These untaxed earnings were then used to finance business ventures, acquire real estate, provide loans, and buy art, furnishings and jewelry for the personal use of the family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of this elaborate scheme involved an offshore bank and an administrative services firm for offshore entities, both housed in a building in the Cayman Islands that we have shown a few times on the Senate floor during this budget debate, the Ugland House. Believe it or not, the building is the official address of 12,748 companies. Just having a post office box in the building enables these shell companies to shift profits that otherwise should be reported as taxable income in the country where  it is actually earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In another case study, two offshore shell corporations engaged in fake stock transactions, seeming to trade stock back and forth as if it were fantasy baseball to create the illusion of economic activity. The shell corporations pretended to run up hundreds of millions of dollars in fake stock losses and then used these phantom losses to offset about $2 billion in real capital gains of the promoters' U.S. clients. The result was $300 million in lost tax revenues to the Treasury. This offshore  scheme would be comical because of its complexity but for the sobering fact that these tax haven abuses are eating away at the fabric of the U.S. tax system and undermining U.S. laws intended to safeguard our capital markets and financial systems from financial crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our investigation shone a needed spotlight into the black box of offshore tax havens. It revealed a system that is corrupt and corrupting. Honest Americans are footing the bill for tax haven abuses, and it is long past time for Congress to shut those abuses down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abusive Tax Shelters. In addition to offshore shenanigans, there are plenty of homegrown tax shelters being used to dodge taxes. For 5 years, our subcommittee has also been conducting investigations into the design, sale, and implementation of these complex transactions that have no economic or business rationale other than to avoid tax. Our first hearing on this topic in recent years was held in January 2002, when the subcommittee examined an abusive tax shelter purchased by Enron. In November  2003, the subcommittee held 2 days of hearings and released a staff report that pulled back the curtain on how even some respected accounting firms, banks, investment</paragraph>
    <paragraph>advisors, and law firms had become engines pushing the design and sale of abusive tax shelters to corporations and individuals across this country. In February 2005, the subcommittee issued a bipartisan report that provided further details on the role these professional firms played in the proliferation of these abusive shelters. Our subcommittee report was endorsed by the full Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in April 2005. Most recently, a 2006 subcommittee staff report  entitled, "Tax Haven Abuses: The Enablers, the Tools, and Secrecy," disclosed how financial and legal professionals designed and sold yet another abusive tax shelter known as the POINT Strategy, which depended on secrecy laws and practices in the Isle of Man to conceal the phantom nature of securities trades that lay at the center of that tax shelter transaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subcommittee investigations have found that many abusive tax shelters are not dreamed up by the taxpayers who use them. Instead, most are devised by tax professionals, such as accountants, bankers, investment advisors, and lawyers, who then sell the tax shelter to clients for a fee. In fact, as our 2003 investigation widened, we found a large number of tax advisors cooking up one complex scheme after another, packaging them up as generic "tax products" with boiler-plate legal and tax opinion  letters, and then undertaking elaborate marketing schemes to peddle these products to literally thousands of persons across the country. In return, these tax shelter promoters were getting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, while diverting billions of dollars in tax revenues from the U.S. Treasury each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, one shelter investigated by the subcommittee and featured in the 2003 hearings has since become part of an IRS effort to settle cases involving a set of abusive tax shelters known as "Son of Boss." Following our hearing, more than 1,200 taxpayers have admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay back taxes, interest, and penalties totaling more than $3.7 billion. That is billions of dollars the IRS has collected on just one type of tax shelter, demonstrating both the depth of the problem  and the potential for progress. The POINT shelter featured in our 2006 hearing involved another $300 million in taxes lost to the Treasury on transactions conducted by just six taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax Levies on Federal Contractors Who Don't Pay Their Taxes. That is not all. For the last 4 years, our subcommittee has been focusing attention on another sector of the tax gap involving Federal contractors who don't pay their taxes. These contractors are stuffing their pockets with taxpayer dollars, while stiffing Uncle Sam by not paying their taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Past subcommittee hearings have exposed the fact that there are about 27,000 defense contractors with $3 billion in unpaid taxes; 33,000 contractors with other Federal agencies who owe $3.3 billion in unpaid tax debt; and 3,800 GSA contractors with $1.4 billion in unpaid tax debt. Earlier this week, another subcommittee hearing put the spotlight on 21,000 Medicare physicians and related medical suppliers with $1.3 billion in unpaid tax debt. These mind-boggling numbers represent tens of thousands  of companies putting their hand in the taxpayers' wallet, while dodging billions of dollars in tax obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A key program designed to stop this type of abuse is the Federal Payment Levy Program. This program was enacted about 10 years ago to enable the Federal Government to identify Federal payments being made to tax deadbeats, and to withhold a portion of those taxpayer dollars to pay off a portion of the person's tax debt. For the last 4 years, our subcommittee has conducted an intensive effort to strengthen the tax levy program for Federal contractors who don't pay their taxes. As a result, over  the past 3 years, tax levy collections as a whole have more than doubled, increasing from about $136 million in 2004 to nearly $340 million in 2006. Of these totals, tax levy collections from Federal contractors in particular have also more than doubled, increasing from about $28 million  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first step would be to require the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to move as quickly as possible to make all $450 billion Medicare and Medicaid payments each year subject to the tax levy program, so that all of these taxpayer dollars are screened for repayment of tax debt. The next step would be to strengthen the tax levy program as a whole. In 2006, for example, the Federal Government identified a total of about $122 billion in assessed tax debt that could be collected, in part,  through the tax levy program. At the same time, it determined that only about 45 percent of that uncollected tax debt was actually matched against the Federal payments being made that year. In other words, in 2006, some $67 billion in tax debt was never "turned on" for actual collection under the tax levy program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simple reforms could ensure that a lot more of that $67 billion is set up for collection under the tax levy program. One key barrier right now, for example, is an elaborate series of tax levy notices, mandated by law, that currently have to be issued by the IRS before tax debt can be collected through the tax levy program. While the tax levy notices make sense if the Federal Government is targeting payments being provided by a third party, such as an employer, they make a lot less sense when  the levy is targeting taxpayer dollars going to the very people who owe the tax debt. For that reason, Senator Coleman and I plan to introduce legislation to reform the tax levy notice process for Federal payments. We also plan to strengthen other aspects of the tax levy program to start narrowing that multibillion-dollar tax gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>IRS Enforcement Efforts to Reduce the Tax Gap. In our efforts to reducing the tax gap, it will be critical that we give the IRS the funds it needs to go after tax dodgers. For every dollar invested in the IRS's budget, the service yields more than $4 in enforcement revenue. Beyond the additional revenues collected, increased IRS enforcement deters those who might otherwise have dodged their tax obligations and reassures honest taxpayers that compliance with the law is broadly achieved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this budget resolution fully funds the President's budget request for the IRS, and includes an additional $399 million available for IRS enforcement activities. I can't think of many better investments to recover revenues wrongfully lost to the U.S. Treasury and to build respect for the law and respect for the honest Americans who play by the rules and meet their tax obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scope of Problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The abusive tax shelters and offshore case studies that the subcommittee has delved into are merely a handful of examples that can be used to better understand the details behind these widespread problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because secrecy is such a key component of offshore abuses, it is incredibly difficult to estimate just how much income is sheltered offshore. Recent estimates from tax experts, Joe Guttentag and Reuven Avi-Yonah, estimate that offshore tax haven abuses by individuals cost the U.S. Treasury between $40 billion and $70 billion a year in taxes that are owed but not collected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporations are also using tax havens to avoid payment of U.S. taxes. Preliminary results from a study to be released soon by Kimberly Clausing of Wellesley College show that $50 billion in U.S. revenue was lost in 2002 from profit-shifting by corporations to low-tax countries. A GAO report Senator Dorgan and I released in 2004 found that nearly two-thirds of the top 100 companies doing business with the U.S. Government had one or more subsidiaries in a tax haven. One company, Tyco  International, had 115. Enron, in its heyday, had over 400 Cayman subsidiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Data released by the Commerce Department further demonstrates the extent of U.S. corporate use of tax havens, indicating that, as of 2001, almost half of all foreign profits of U.S. corporations were in tax havens. A study released by the journal, "Tax Notes" in September 2004 found that American companies were able to shift $149 billion of profits to 18 tax haven countries in 2002, up 68 percent from $88 billion in 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2004 study by Professor John Zdanowicz found that transfer pricing abuses by corporations cost the U.S. Treasury $53 billion a year. Last year the IRS settled a transfer pricing dispute with one company alone, drug giant Glaxo SmithKline, for $3.4 billion. The size of this settlement with just one company indicates that it is worth looking to see if there are ways to improve the relevant portions of the Tax Code. Treasury has proposed regulations in this area, and I urge the administration  to finalize those rules in as strong a form as possible. I also urge the Finance Committee and others to make it a priority to stop these transfer pricing abuses that are hurting average taxpayers as well as disadvantaging U.S. companies that play by the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How to Address the Problem. One of the big questions that surrounds all of this is how to start addressing these problems. I have a bill that would be a huge step in the right direction. We can't let the offshore tax havens hide $100 billion in U.S. tax revenues which are needed to protect our troops, fund health care and education, and meet the other needs of American families. We cannot tolerate high-priced accountants, lawyers, and banks concocting ways for tax cheats to offload their unpaid  taxes onto the backs of honest taxpayers. That is why earlier this year I introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, along with Senators Coleman and Obama. This bill provides a powerful set of new tools to clamp down on offshore tax and tax shelter abuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other measures, our bill would:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establish Presumptions to Combat Offshore Secrecy by allowing U.S. tax and securities law enforcement to presume that nonpublicly traded, offshore corporations and trusts are controlled by the U.S. taxpayers who formed them or sent them assets, and to presume that money moving between U.S. taxpayers and offshore entities is taxable income, unless the taxpayer proves otherwise;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Impose Tougher Requirements on U.S. Taxpayers Using Offshore Secrecy Jurisdictions by listing 34 jurisdictions which have already been named in IRS court filings as probable locations for U.S. tax evasion;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorize Special Measures to Stop Offshore Tax Abuses by giving Treasury authority to take special measures against foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions that impede U.S. tax enforcement;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strengthen Detection of Offshore Activities by requiring U.S. financial institutions that open accounts for foreign entities controlled by U.S. clients, open accounts in offshore secrecy jurisdictions for U.S. clients, or establish entities in offshore secrecy jurisdictions for U.S. clients, to report such actions to the IRS;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Close Offshore Trust Loopholes by taxing offshore trust income used to buy real estate, artwork and jewelry for U.S. persons, and treating as trust beneficiaries those persons who actually receive offshore trust assets;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strengthen Penalties on tax shelter promoters by increasing the maximum fine to 150 percent of their ill-gotten gains, and on corporate insiders who hide offshore stock holdings by increasing the maximum fine on them to $1 million per violation of U.S. securities laws;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stop Tax Shelter Patents by prohibiting the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from issuing patents for "inventions designed to minimize, avoid, defer, or otherwise affect liability for Federal, State, local, or foreign tax".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is only a partial list of a host of innovative measures we have included in our bill to strengthen the ability of Federal regulators to combat offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses. We believe these new tools merit congressional attention and enactment this year if we are going to begin to make a serious dent in the $100 billion in annual lost tax revenue from offshore tax abuses that forces honest taxpayers to shoulder a greater tax burden than they would otherwise have to bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax cheats make it harder to maintain our highways, protect our borders, advance medical research, and inspect our food. They make it difficult to give needed tax relief to small businesses  and middle-income victims of the alternative minimum tax. They also deepen the deficit ditch that threatens the economic well-being of our children and grandchildren. The assumptions made in this budget resolution that we can raise ample revenues by shutting them  down are not only reasonable, they are crucial to maintaining the integrity of our tax system. I applaud Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee, as well as the Finance Committee and Chairman Baucus, for their hard fought efforts on this front, and I look forward to working with them and other allies on this issue as we address these problems later this year.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support this budget resolution. For the last few years, I have not been able to support the budget resolution because it focused on the wrong priorities. I would like to commend Senate Budget Committee Chairman Conrad for crafting a budget resolution that focuses on the right priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have before us a resolution that restores fiscal sanity to the budget process. It recognizes the realities of our current and future financial situation. This resolution eliminates the deficit by 2012 and unlike the Bush administration's budget it does not leave out important costs like the funding of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and addressing the individual alternative minimum tax, AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget resolution returns discipline to the budget process. It restores the pay-as-you-go-rule which was essential to reducing the deficit in the 1990s. It includes a provision which requires the reconciliation process to be used for deficit reduction. The reconciliation process was designed to set-up a procedure to expedite the passage of legislation. It was used successfully to reduce the deficit, but in recent years it was used to pass debt-financed tax cuts. Today, we are restoring the  reconciliation process to its original purpose--deficit reduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The priority of the Administration's budget is to make permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--at the expense of hard working families. This budget puts families first; it puts education first; it puts health care first. It is a resolution we can and should be proud of, particularly because we will be reauthorizing the Higher Education Act and No Child Left Behind this year. Now we know we will have enough money to make a difference with our legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution specifically and substantially addresses one of my legislative priorities--providing health insurance to children. In 2005, 361,000 children under the age of 18 were added to the rolls of the uninsured, the first time in almost a decade that the number of children without insurance in this country increased. This brings the total number of uninsured children under the age of 21 to a staggering 11 million. Thankfully, this budget begins to put kids first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the resolution, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, will be funded with an additional $50 billion over the next five years. This will maintain coverage for all currently enrolled children and enable coverage to be expanded to the estimated six million children that are eligible for, but not enrolled in, public health insurance programs. I will continue to work on this issue to ensure that every child in America gets the health care coverage they deserve: Their health  and our future depend upon it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget resolution includes many deficit-neutral reserve funds which will allow us to address our priorities in a fiscally responsible manner, including a fund for small business health care. Recently, Senator Snowe and I held a hearing on this issue in the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. This hearing provided a blueprint for how we can move forward to provide small business owners the relief they need from rising premium costs while also ensuring that more employees  of small firms have access to affordable, meaningful health care coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced legislation that would provide small businesses with refundable tax credits to help with the cost of providing their employees with coverage. I am also working on reinsurance legislation that would help small businesses with catastrophic costs. Small business health care needs to be addressed this year. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget makes veterans a priority. Our veterans have admirably served their country and should receive the best health care that we can provide them. To follow through on this promise this budget resolution includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to make sure that veterans receive necessary treatments and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offered an amendment which ensures that this reserve fund addresses the needs of low-vision and blinded veterans. More and more of our brave soldiers returning from Iraq are coming home with serious eye injuries, mainly caused by traumatic brain injury. We must do our best to provide vision rehabilitation and screening services to try and save the sight of these veterans. The statistics are staggering: from March 2003 to April 2005, 16 percent of all causalities from Iraq had direct eye injuries.  Between Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital they have performed over 1,200 emergency eye surgeries. I am pleased that my amendment passed so that low-vision and blinded veterans will get the services they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this budget resolution puts an end to the myth that tax cuts pay for themselves. During the debate on this budget resolution, many of my colleagues argued that this resolution represents a tax increase. That is wrong. This budget provides a deficit-neutral reserve fund for tax relief. This will give the Finance Committee the opportunity to evaluate the tax cuts and extend them in a revenue neutral manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget addresses the individual AMT for 2007 and 2008. The Administration's budget only addresses this AMT for 2007. The resolution will prevent new taxpayers from being impacted by the AMT for the next 2 years and gives us time to work on a fiscally responsible solution. We need to address the AMT so it no longer punishes families with children that live in high tax States. Without addressing the AMT, there will be a hidden tax increase on the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this fiscally responsible budget resolution that puts families first.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as the Senate concludes debate on the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution, I would like to thank Chairman CONRAD and Senator GREGG for all of their hard work at the mark-up last week. We had a constructive debate, and while I did not vote for the product, I respect the process and way he ran the committee mark-up. I know that crafting an annual budget is a difficult task. I also want to acknowledge the importance of writing and passing a budget resolution.  This document is a vital part of the operation of Congress. It sets a fiscal blueprint that Congress will follow for the year, and establishes procedural hurdles when these guidelines are not adhered to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an accountant, I think it is a valuable exercise to review our Nation's overall priorities. I was disappointed to learn that the committee-reported resolution, adopted on a party-line vote, doesn't do more to promote economic growth and limit overall government spending. This is a tax-and-spend, big-government budget. It assumes that the tax cuts will expire as scheduled under current law, resulting in $900 billion in tax increases for Americans. The Democratic budget also far outspends the  President's discretionary budget request. The committee-reported resolution allows for $949 billion in regular, nonemergency budget authority to the appropriations committee, $18 billion more than the President's requested level of $933 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also does nothing, on net, to reduce mandatory spending. Our Nation's mandatory health programs are growing each year by more than 6 percent--an unsustainable level--and last week the Budget Committee rejected, on party-line votes, two amendments that would have included reconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee to contain this spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a legislative track record of fiscal responsibility and meaningful deficit reduction. In 2005, under the Deficit Reduction Act, the Republican Congress was able to produce nearly $40 billion in spending cuts. I am proud that under my chairmanship, the HELP Committee led the entire Congress in deficit reduction, and produced  $15.5 billion in savings--that is 40 percent of the entire law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that was then. Let me restate that now, the budget resolution we are debating on the floor of the Senate does nothing to reduce net mandatory spending. It's not right to overspend now--and pass the bill on to our children and grandchildren to pay later. I challenge the Senate to work across party lines and do more to shore up our economic  future. If one-half of the Senate authorizing committees equal the level of deficit reduction this year that the HELP Committee achieved in 2005, the deficit would be reduced by an additional $100 billion. But this week, similar to the mark-up last week, the Senate rejected multiple amendments to reform our Nation's largest entitlement programs and slow the growth in mandatory spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my role as lead Republican on the HELP Committee, I will continue to use the reauthorization process to stretch Federal dollars the farthest--ensuring that programs are cost effective and not duplicative, so that precious Federal funds touch as many people as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will also look for an avenue this year to address health care access and affordability. As my colleagues know, last year Senator BEN NELSON and I introduced legislation that would allow business and trade associations to band their members together in small business health plans, and offer group health coverage on a national or statewide basis. This legislation, The Health Insurance Marketplace and Modernization and Affordability Act, was a direct response to the runaway costs that are  driving Americans and small businesses away from the health insurance marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The HELP Committee has a role to play in making employer-sponsored health care more accessible and affordable. Employer-provided health insurance is voluntary--and it is in critical condition. Sixty percent of the country's employers offer insurance today, down 9 percent from just 5 years ago. And the cost of health insurance for companies has nearly doubled in that same period--with employers expected to pay an average of $8,167 per employee family, versus $4,248 5 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Progress on this critical issue is moving forward, and bipartisan discussions are promising. Last year we built a very solid foundation, which continues to grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are continuing to move forward on this issue and to deal with outstanding concerns. I am actively engaged in negotiations with other members of this body on how best to craft that proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather, the best way to achieve real small business health care reform is to proceed forcefully to build on the significant progress we made last year. Development of small business health legislation is a process that is well along, and I believe success is in sight. We are on a promising track, and we should stick with it. America's small businesses deserve no less than our sincere commitment to make this effort a success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to mention progress on another HELP-related bill, mental health parity legislation. In February, the HELP Committee favorably reported the Domenici-Kennedy-Enzi compromise parity bill on a bipartisan vote of 18-3. It is the product of more than 2 years of bipartisan negotiations and supported by more than 60 organizations. I am pleased that Senator DOMENICI authored a deficit-neutral reserve fund for mental health parity legislation at the mark-up last week. This reserve fund  will serve as a placeholder in the budget for our compromise legislation, which focuses on a benefit, not a mandate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I would like to call attention to an amendment that I offered at the Budget mark-up last week, and reoffered on the floor. The amendment is very simple: it establishes a 60-vote threshold for legislation that imposes unfunded mandates on the private sector, in excess of the $131 million threshold for fiscal year 2007 established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, UMRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 60-vote point of order currently applies to legislation that imposes unfunded mandates on State and local governments. I think the Senate should have a new 60-vote point of order that applies to legislation that creates unfunded private sector mandates. We here in Washington must stop thinking that we have a monopoly on good ideas. This is a commonsense proposal, and should have been approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to take this opportunity to mention a few programs that are important to Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our Nation's most abundant energy source, coal must play a central role in electrical generation for years to come. In order for that to happen, we need to continue finding ways to make coal generation cleaner. Programs like the Clean Coal Power Initiative will play a major role in making that happen and so I support increased funding of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to see proper funding of the Federal loan guarantee program. Federal loan guarantees can play an important role in developing new energy projects. It is my hope that we can provide enough funding to get some of these projects off the drawing board, and most specifically, I hope that we provide funding to the Department of Energy to move forward with loan guarantees for coal-to-liquids projects. Coal-to-liquids technology has the potential to help reduce our Nation's dependence on  foreign energy barons and should be explored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, funding for rural air service and maintenance is essential for states like Wyoming. Without Federal support through essential air service and airport improvement  programs, many rural communities would have no commercial air service and extremely limited general aviation. I hope this issue will be part of the debate on the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration this year. I encourage my colleagues to recognize the importance of this funding, not only as a matter of dependability, but also as a public safety issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to mention two additional issues of great importance to Wyoming and other rural States; housing and homelessness. The McKinney Vento Homelessness Assistance Act is the primary law through which Congress funds homelessness programs in the United States. Unfortunately, rural States have historically received very little of this money. Yet rural States must confront homelessness too, and the geographic size of our States further complicates our efforts. In response to this, Congress authorized  the Rural Homelessness Grant Program in 1992 under the McKinney-Vento Act. This program provides funding for transitional housing and education services in rural States, as well as rental or down-payment assistance. The intent of this program is to level the playing field</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to briefly call attention to the Small Business Administration. I serve on the Small Business Committee and enjoy using my small business experience to help make a difference in the lives of many people in Wyoming and throughout the country. We are working in Wyoming to stabilize and steadily grow our small businesses through the utilization of the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, program. The risk and expense of conducting serious research and development efforts are often  beyond the means of many small businesses, especially rural small businesses. By reserving a specific percentage of Federal R&amp;D funds for small business, SBIR enables small businesses to compete on the same level as larger businesses and stimulate high-tech innovation in their rural States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAST and Rural Outreach programs are congressionally authorized programs that provide technical assistance that helps Wyoming's small businesses utilize the SBIR program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Agriculture Committee has a big task in reauthorizing the farm bill this year. Writing a tight budget that will help us reach our long-term fiscal goals is a priority for me. However, we also need to provide adequate funding in the budget for the farm bill. Though you cannot tell by the name, the farm bill affects the lives of many unsuspecting Americans. Policies and projects for distance learning, conservation, food assistance, renewable fuels, and our forests are  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="3693">S3693</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate should reject this tax and spend budget. It increases taxes on working families by $900 billion, creates a spending spree on the Government's credit card and does nothing to contain runaway entitlement spending.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to support the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution and our Budget chairman, Senator Conrad, who has done an extraordinary job in developing such a thoughtful resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget resolution helps to get our country back on the right fiscal track, and it highlights many priorities for American families that were neglected or ignored over the last few years. For example, this resolution increases discretionary education funding by about $9 billion so that we can invest in title 1, IDEA and improving Pell grants and student aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another important change is the investment in our veterans by providing $3.5 billion more for the VA. This resolution approximately matches the funding request of the veteran's organizations, known as the independent budget. It is a travesty that VA has been underfunded in the past as veterans are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. In West Virginia, I host confidential roundtables to listen in private to our returning veterans. I want to hear from them personally about their experience in combat,  and their care and treatment after they come home. I am deeply disturbed by stories of hassles to get medical appointment and lengthy delays in processing claims for benefits. Every veteran who has bravely served our Nation deserves timely and quality care and benefits. Because of the violence and intense combat, many of our returning veterans want and need mental health care. We have a moral</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One part of this resolution that is deeply important to me is the investment of $50 billion for reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP. In 1997, I fought hard to create this program, and I am enormously proud of the success of CHIP in providing insurance coverage to children. In my own State of West Virginia, there are nearly 40,000 children covered through CHIP each year. This budget resolution will allow us to move CHIP forward in two important ways: first, to maintain  coverage for children currently enrolled in the program today and, second, to expand coverage to children who are eligible but not yet enrolled in the program. This provision is a strong signal of the new priorities of the leadership in the 110th Congress. I would like to particularly thank Senator Conrad and his staff</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget resolution is responsible. It restores pay-as-you-go rules. But it also includes deficit-neutral reserve funds so that Congress can move forward on important areas like reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, competitiveness and other domestic priorities that have been ignored for too long. I have been proud to support this budget resolution throughout a long day of votes, and I want to thank and commend our chairman, Senator Conrad, for a job well done.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget resolution provides Congress with a $2.9 trillion spending blueprint for the upcoming year. It establishes a process and guidelines by which Congress will determine the revenues and spending for the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this resolution. It puts our Nation on the road back to fiscal responsibility. Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned about our Nation's fiscal health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have moved a long way from where we were 6 years ago. When President Clinton left office, he left with a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion. That surplus could have allowed Congress to eliminate the Nation's debt by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today, the Nation faces a $248 billion deficit and the debt has grown to $8.9 trillion. This translates to roughly $30,000 owed by each and every United States citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It took almost 200 years for every President from George Washington to George H.W. Bush to amass $2.6 trillion in debt. President Bush matched their $2.6 trillion in debt in just 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office projects the interest payments on the debt will be more than $3 trillion. That is $3 trillion that cannot be spent on priorities like healthcare, education or homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This should be a major concern to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is in this situation because of the misplaced policies of the Bush administration and the Republican Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's tax cuts have cost this Nation over $1 trillion. Over the next 10 years, these tax cuts will cost over $3 trillion more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vast majority of these tax cuts have gone to benefit the very wealthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the War in Iraq and Afghanistan has cost $510 billion to date. And there is no end in sight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has squeezed the budget and made it difficult to fund all those programs that deserve funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you what this means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President submitted his budget proposal to Congress on February 5, it was deeply flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It cut or eliminated 141 programs, programs that are of great importance to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of California was especially hard hit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget proposed cutting Community Development Block Grants by 21 percent. This would have meant that California's CDBG funding would be cut by almost $140 million from its 2006 funding level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would be devastating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the City of Victorville, CDBG funds have helped revitalize areas of the city 3000 residents call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Los Angeles, these funds have allowed 8,500 housing units to be rehabilitated. CDBG funds have preserved over 2,000 jobs and removed over 41 million square feet of graffiti.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the President's budget did not support this important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget also short-changed the law enforcement programs that Americans rely on for their continued safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS, program was eliminated under the President's budget, as was the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP. As a border State, these programs are essential to California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, under the President's budget, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, was given only half of the funding that is necessary to continue to serve the children already enrolled in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good news is the budget before us today restores many of the President's cuts. For instance:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It funds CDBG at 2007 levels, plus an adjustment for inflation. California State and local governments can continue to work for housing and community development in low-income areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget also restores funding to the COPS program. It allocates $522 million for COPS, a program that has put over 100,000 police officers on the streets in communities across the country. And we have adopted an amendment by my colleague Senator Biden to increase COPS funding to its authorized level of $1.5 billion. I was proud to support this increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget also restores $407 million for SCAAP. And through an amendment I offered and the Senate has adopted, will increase the funding for SCAAP to its authorized level of $950 million. California has the highest number of undocumented aliens in the country. And California prisons house over 20,000 criminal aliens, incurring tremendous costs. Last year alone, California spent over $715 million keeping criminal aliens off the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget increases spending on SCHIP from $2 billion in the President's budget to $50 billion. The $48 billion increase will allow for continued coverage of all currently enrolled children in SCHIP. This budget then goes one step further. It expands SCHIP, insuring an additional six million children who are currently eligible for this program but are not enrolled. Young Americans should not suffer as a result of the President's misplaced priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this budget provides critically needed funding for vital Veterans' care programs. Specifically, it provides over $43 billion for Veterans, $3.5 billion more than the proposal offered by President Bush. This money will allow our brave troops to obtain the medical care they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the alarming revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and other Veterans' facilities around the country, it is clear that we need to ensure that VA facilities provide the highest level of care. This proposal funds medical and prosthetic research and information technology; and it ensures that baseline operating expenses are met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the proposal provides middle-income taxpayers relief from the alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Absent congressional action, nearly 20 million more Americans will be forced to pay the AMT next year. This proposal adds 2 years of relief from the AMT, where the President could only find room for 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress faced many restrictions and tough choices in crafting this budget. And lawmakers' hands were tied due to years of fiscal mismanagement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget resolution is far from perfect. It fails to provide permanent relief from the AMT for middle-class families and, while it restores much needed funds in critical areas, it does not fully fund critical programs. But it refocuses our priorities. And it takes important steps to restore fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the President's budget proposal, this budget will create a surplus in 2012 and is nearly balanced a year before that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Change will take time. And there is no cure-all for the years of fiscal irresponsibility and misguided policies that we have seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said before, this budget is far from perfect. However, it initiates much needed change and I believe will put us back on the path from which the President and Republican Congress strayed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to act in the best interest of Americans who have entrusted us with a great responsibility. I hope that they will join me today in meeting this responsibility by voting for the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak today as a member of the Senate Budget Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had hoped that the budget that was presented before the Committee last week was going to be fiscally responsible. Chairman CONRAD had said earlier this year that he was prepared to get savings out of long-term entitlement programs. He had made similar statements in the past. So I had some hope that this budget would take a serious look at what we could do to address the issue of out-of-control entitlement growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I was not able to support this budget in Committee and I will not be able to support it here on the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget does not take seriously the out-of-control entitlement spending looming on the horizon. This budget resolution fails to show that Congress is willing to make the difficult choices necessary to ensure that the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs will continue into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country faces $67 trillion in unfunded liabilities over the next 75 years. Thirty two trillion dollars of that is in the Medicare program, $20 trillion is in the Medicaid program and the remaining $15 trillion is in the Social Security program and other liabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator GREGG pointed out yesterday, $67 trillion represents more than the entire amount of revenues received by the Federal Government since the beginning of the republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How are our children supposed to pay for that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't have to wait 75 years for the problem to blow up in our faces. In about 2032--almost 25 years from now--the cost of just Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, if left unchecked, will exceed the 18.2 percent of GDP that is the historic level of our Federal revenues. So every single penny of what should be received by the Federal Government in revenue will be spent on just three programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where is the money for defense to come from? Where is money for education to come from? LIHEAP? NASA? Worker training? Border enforcement? Name any program that you support and tell me just where the money is to come from? This is the future we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet this budget resolution doesn't move a toe toward fixing it. It includes not one penny in net entitlement reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush presented Congress with a budget that makes strides in this direction by attempting to slow the rate of growth in these programs. I'm not talking about wholesale reform here--although I feel that such reform is needed. Just implementing incremental changes can make a huge difference simply because of the enormous amounts of money that we are dealing with here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in Medicare the President proposed reducing the growth in the program from 6.5 percent to 5.6 percent over 5 years. This change, just a 1 percent reduction from how Medicare would otherwise grow over the same time period, is estimated to reduce Medicare's 75-year unfunded liability by 25 percent--or $8 trillion. For Medicaid, the President proposed reducing the growth rate from 7.3 percent to 7.1 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keep in mind that this means we will still have spending increases in these programs--pretty substantial increases in fact. However, these increases just won't be as big as originally projected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget calls for some commonsense reforms to both Medicare and Medicaid to reduce spending. In Medicare, for example, the President's budget makes several suggestions to ensure that the program is adequately paying providers for the cost of care without overpaying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Medicaid, the President has proposed ensuring Medicaid prescription drugs are reimbursed fairly and by improving the financial integrity of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Finance Committee, I would obviously need to take a close look at these reforms before any are implemented. However, it is vitally important that the American taxpayer does Not overpay for health care services or products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget also requires wealthy seniors to pay more for Medicare by reducing the Federal subsidy for Medicare Part D premiums for these seniors. This means that seniors who have incomes over $80,000 for an individual or $160,000 for a couple would be required to pay more for their Medicare drug benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, this just makes sense. Today's working middle-class American taxpayers should not be subsidizing the health care of Bill</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gates' father. Also, we already do this for Medicare Part B. Such a change would only affect about 5 percent of seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the types of changes that we need to be making. Yet this budget resolution before us today makes no net changes to entitlement programs. This, despite the fact that the Big 3 entitlement programs currently account for over 41 percent of the Federal budget, and that number will grow to almost 57 percent in 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A budget that does not seriously address entitlement spending is not responsible. This budget is not responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I am not asking for wholesale reforms here. I am very supportive of looking at comprehensive reforms and I support the efforts of Chairman Conrad and Senator Gregg to set up a bipartisan group to take a look at recommending them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that is not what I am asking for in this budget before us today. We should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Maybe we don't have a perfect way to fix our entitlement challenge right now. But we could have made a good start this year and started on some incremental changes. However, the authors of this budget chose not to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We face a demographic tidal wave in this country. As the baby-boom generation grows older, the number of people  in the United States ages 65 and over is expected to roughly double by 2030. But instead of saving for a rainy day, we continue to spend, spend, spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hard choices have to be made. Spending has to be controlled. Entitlements have to be reigned in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are saddling our children and grandchildren with an unfair burden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget started us in the right direction. Unfortunately, the Democratic budget has dropped the ball, and pushed off the inevitable hard decisions until another day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am profoundly disappointed with the budget I see before us today, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the budget resolution currently before this body. This budget restores fiscal discipline on both the spending and revenue sides of the ledger, reinstates the pay-as-you-go rules that were so successful during the late 1990s in helping us achieve budget surpluses, and provides a responsible framework for meeting our Nation's most important priorities. With these accomplishments, it represents a major improvement over the budgets of  recent years and the budget submitted by the President last month. It puts our country in a much better position to address the major long-term fiscal challenges looming just around the corner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We as Americans are fortunate to be a part of the world's largest and most prosperous economy. America is, by many measures, doing well but I defy anyone to say we that we cannot do better. We must ensure our national security and restore our moral authority in the world. We must address growing middle class insecurity, reflected in falling incomes coupled with rising costs and record low personal savings coupled with record high household debt. We must stem the backward slide of rising poverty  of recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation, we must take this opportunity to lay a strong foundation for the future: to constructively respond to the accelerating pace of globalization, to secure clean and renewable sources of energy, and to rein in the skyrocketing health care costs that threaten to overwhelm the budgets of households, businesses, and the Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our ability to effectively address any of these challenges, Mr. President, depends on properly managing our fiscal resources. This budget takes an important step towards restoring fiscal responsibility, reversing the profligate trend of the last several years. Since the current President took office, fiscal discipline has been thrown to the wind. Since 2000, we have seen our nation go from a $236 billion budget surplus to a projected $244 billion deficit, from a National debt of $5.6 trillion  to $8.8 trillion today, with the share of that debt held by foreign lenders doubling. Critical investments in education and infrastructure have been shortchanged, and middle-class tax cuts have been passed over in favor of more lavish, budget-busting tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans who needed them least.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of continuing these irresponsible policies and passing the costs on to our children and grandchildren, the budget now before us would restore fiscal discipline and renew investments in our nation's critical priorities. First and foremost, it reinstates common-sense pay-as-you-go rules that require any new spending or tax cuts to be paid for up front, rather than added to the debt. And because of this commitment to pay-as-you-go, it balances the federal budget within 5 years and reduces  the debt as a share of the economy. It requires honest budgeting for the cost of ongoing military operations. The resolution also imposes discipline on both spending and revenue, lowering spending every year as a share of the economy and cracking down on abusive tax shelters that cost American taxpayers an average of $2,000 apiece every year, according to the Internal Revenue Service's National Taxpayer Advocate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within the context of fiscal responsibility, this budget also allocates our resources to our Nation's most important priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, few priorities are more important than investing in our Nation's children. The budget before us recognizes this commitment by rejecting the President's proposed cuts to education. Instead, it provides a funding increase of $9.2 billion above the president's request for education and training, from birth through post-secondary education, including Head Start, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), programs authorized under the No Child Left Behind Act, and Pell  Grants. The increased investment will ensure that more preschool children from disadvantaged backgrounds will be ready for school. It will help elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools close achievement gaps; increase graduation rates; and reduce the need for remedial education at a later time. It will ensure that schools can attract, train, and retain high-quality teachers. It will keep our commitment to educate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to investing in our human capital, this budget also makes important investments in our physical capital. Specifically, it honors the funding levels for highways and transit that were authorized for fiscal year 2008 in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA), funding that will help States and communities conduct critical maintenance and make needed improvements in their transportation infrastructure. It more than doubles funding for transit security  an important start, although more still needs to be done and rejects the Bush administration's continued attempts to zero out funding for Amtrak, which serves so many people in Connecticut and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the number of Americans without health insurance on the rise, this budget provides up to $50 billion to help cover uninsured children through the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, which is up for reauthorization this year. We also know that this administration has failed to meet its commitments to the health of our veterans, as revealed by the recent reports on the disgraceful conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. As an answer to this major shortfall, the budget  before us provides more than $3.5 billion for veterans above the level proposed by the administration. And where previous budgets have cut funding for first responders, this budget restores the administration's proposed cuts to Firefighter Grants, the COPS program, and Local Law Enforcement</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would also add and I have already spoken on this matter--that I am pleased that the Senate voted to adopt the Smith-Dodd amendment to add $2.2 billion to Function 150 for the International Affairs budget, which will provide important funds for international aid, poverty reduction, and other critical foreign policy priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the priorities in this budget set a positive course for our Nation. In its lists of numbers we read a statement of our values. We can all speak in unlimited praise of responsibility and education and opportunity in the abstract but for the first time in several years, I'm proud to say we have a budget in front of us that puts flesh on our words. It restores discipline. It confronts the challenges of a struggling middle class and an aging population, promoting opportunity, prosperity,  and security across the board. And it puts the American people's money towards the wisest priority of all: investing in the years to come. In sum, I think we have a budget that reflects the best values of the American people, and I am proud to give it my support.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment with this year's budget resolution. This budget is putting us on a very dangerous path in terms of our economy. A huge tax hike is not the right direction for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican progrowth tax policies that have been implemented over the past few years have had a tremendous impact on our economy. Since August 2003, more than 7.5 million jobs have been created. Our unemployment rate remains low at 4.5 percent--which is well below the 5.1 percent average rate for 2005 and below the average of each of the past four decades. Thanks to our strong economic growth, tax revenues continue to pour in. Tax receipts were up about 12 percent in 2006, on top of 2005's  14.6 percent increase. Receipts have grown another 8 percent so far in fiscal year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But instead of building on this success, this budget takes us in a completely different direction. The resolution would raise taxes by $900 billion--the largest tax hike in history. This tax increase will have real consequences on American families. An Oregon family of four with $50,000 in earnings will see their taxes go up 132 percent to $3,675 in 2011 if the Republican tax relief is not made permanent, and 15 million seniors would see their taxes increase if current tax policy is not extended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are heading in the wrong direction with this budget. Therefore, I will be voting against the budget resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, after many long years of flawed budget policies that have eroded our Nation's infrastructure and recklessly taken from the health and safety of American working families, the Senate finally has an opportunity to change course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has submitted a grossly inadequate budget request for the fiscal year 2008, built around the erroneous premise that tax cuts are sacrosanct. I reject that argument. I hope that my colleagues will reject that argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget includes $2 trillion of new tax cuts, many of which will benefit those who least need them. In order to fund those tax breaks, the President cuts the programs that working Americans rely on the most. The President proposes to cut the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, which provide health care to seniors and children. He proposes to cut funding for housing for the elderly in rural America. He proposes to cut funding for first responder programs, jeopardizing the safety of  our firefighters and law enforcement officers, and those of us whom they protect. He proposes to cut funding for our children and schools, for health care research and rural hospitals, and for our communities and economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President is proposing to take an awful lot from working American families in order to pay for his tax breaks. His budget cuts are not funding the troops overseas, or being used to pay down the national debt. The president's own budget tables show that the gross federal debt will continue to increase to record levels, $12 trillion in the next five years, even if his spending cuts are enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reject the argument that seniors must give up their health care, and that children must give up funding for their schools, in order to fund tax breaks for the wealthiest of the wealthy in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget continues the dangerous practice of chipping away at domestic priorities, and trying to get away with spending as little as possible on critical infrastructure. There are consequences--sometimes significant consequences, and sometimes deadly consequences--when the administration tries to hide the impact of its budget cuts in order to fund more tax cuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>H.G. Wells wrote that human history is a race between education and catastrophe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress must get into the race to avert the next catastrophe. The squeeze on domestic discretionary spending these past years has done a lot of damage to the infrastructure of our Nation. It has resulted in budgetary shortfalls that are wholly irresponsible, and they must be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at FEMA's inability to respond to natural disasters. Look at the shortfalls in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistant Program, LIHEAP, affecting so many of our States. Look at the shortfalls in our homeland security, where glaring vulnerabilities along the border are left to linger year after year after year. Look at the shortfalls in the funding for our veterans. The problems at Walter Reed did not happen because our military is not committed to caring for its wounded. It happened because  we have an administration that is trying to cut corners in order to pay for its tax breaks for wealthy Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at the Department of Labor, where the administration chipped away at the mine safety budget for 6 years until it had lost 217 inspectors, undermined the enforcement of the Mine Act, and left coal miners underground with inadequate safety equipment. It is no coincidence that mining deaths increased to record numbers last year, while the administration cut the coal enforcement budget, reduced the number of safety inspectors, and reduced the severity of enforcement actions against habitual  violators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gas and energy prices are on the rise again, and, still, the President's budget does not adequately address our Nation's congested roads, our overcrowded transit and rail systems, or the energy bottlenecks causing higher prices and electricity failures and power outages. These are the festering signs of our Nation's infrastructure slowly being starved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the catastrophes come, they are Hurricanes that brutalize our cities and people, or scandals that surface at our Nation's veterans facilities, or tragedies that take the lives of our coal miners underground due to lack of sufficient Federal inspections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reject the administration's tactics of cutting funds and hiding the consequences until a catastrophe hits. I reject that kind of Russian roulette. I reject the notion that the health and safety of the American people is less important than extending a tax cut. Today, the Congress has an opportunity to reject that approach, and I hope that it does reject it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must have a budget that sets realistic spending levels. That is the only way to real budget enforcement and discipline. The last Congresses pinned their expectations to pie-in-the-sky, fantasy spending levels that were totally disconnected from reality. When those budgets proved inadequate and the appropriations process stalled, the Congress was forced to consider massive off-budget supplementals and end-of-the-year continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills that exempted hundreds of  billions of dollars of spending from the oversight of the regular appropriations process. The result was always higher deficits, and less accountability to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget before the Senate today rejects that approach. It sets realistic spending levels that would allow the Congress to consider the annual appropriations bills in a timely manner, and subject those bills to debate and amendments in the Senate. That is the best kind of enforcement mechanism--full and open debate and amendments. This budget sets a discretionary spending level of $949 billion in the fiscal year 2008, $16 billion above the President's request, and above the President's requested  freeze at fiscal year 2007 levels for domestic programs. The Congress must address the unacceptable cuts in health care, veterans programs, and other critical priorities that have been proposed by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget is practical, and it is tough. This is not a budget lacking in enforcement mechanisms, and they would apply equally and fairly to all pieces of the budget revenues, mandatory entitlements, and discretionary spending. This budget caps discretionary spending in the fiscal year 2008, subject to a 60-vote point of order. It caps advance appropriations in the fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and it creates a 60-vote point of order against both emergency defense and nondefense spending, to limit  the kind of budget gimmickry that has been used in the past to circumvent the discretionary spending caps. On the revenue and mandatory entitlement side of the ledger, this budget restores pay-go budget enforcement, subjecting new mandatory spending and tax cuts that are not offset to a 60-vote point of order. It also creates a 60-vote point of order against reconciliation legislation that worsens the deficit, causes a deficit,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget gives the Congress the flexibility it needs to address the gross deficiencies in the president's request, and it demands savings from every piece of the budget--revenues, discretionary, and mandatory--in order to do it. This budget is evenhanded and fair, and its spending levels can be enforced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for writing a budget that sets a new course. I hope that the Senate follows the lead of our chairman. He is trying to address the next catastrophe before it happens. He is trying to set enforceable spending limits to rein in this administration's budget deficits. He is doing the right thing with this budget. It deserves the support of the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the great untold story of the post-9/11 period is the recovery of America's will to move on, despite new threats, and build an even stronger economy, an even stronger America than before. We gave the American people the tools they needed to help themselves and then we got out of the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We eliminated the marriage penalty and doubled the child tax credit. We created a tuition tax deduction. We increased the deduction on charitable gifts and put the death tax on the road to extinction. We slashed the tax on capital gains and dividends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people took care of the rest. They took all these things and unleashed a flood of economic activity that is still lifting the tide for tens of millions of working families and retirees. We look out at the American economy today with amazement. Despite &#xD0;9/11, despite a recession, despite Katrina, despite a war, we see: 4.5 percent unemployment--lower than the average of the last four decades. An economy that is grown at 3.4 percent over the last four quarters. More than 7.2 million  new jobs since August '03</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is more jobs over the last 4 years than the European Union and Japan--combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China may have the world's fastest growing economy. But its entire GDP is less than the amount that ours has grown in the last 5 1/2  years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New jobs create new revenue, and it's been pouring into the U.S. Treasury at a staggering clip. Since we cut taxes on capital gains, tax revenues exceeded government estimates by more than two-thirds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush looked out over this economic landscape too, and he gave us a budget that builds on it, that advocates discipline and anticipates continued strong revenues by keeping tax cuts in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the formula for continuing to shrink the deficit and leading us to a surplus. And we had reason to think the Democrats would embrace it, even on taxes, when my good friend the senior Senator from Nevada said back in November that raising taxes would be, "Unacceptable."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we should have known better. Budget week is like an annual debutante ball for the Democrats. They step out so everybody can take a good look at them, but their budgets never look good in the lights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget they proposed this week was a disaster. It restored the marriage tax, cut the child credit in half, lowered deductions on everything from charitable gifts to college tuition, and raised taxes on capital gains and dividends. It wasn't just a tax increase. It was the mother of all tax increases. Nearly four times bigger than the previous record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It reversed every tax cut we passed, and its passage would have resulted in a tax increase on every single taxpayer in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A family of four with two kids and an annual income of $56,300 would pay an extra $2,000</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 50 million married couples would pay an extra $2,700 each year in taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 10 million single mothers would see their tax bill go up by more than $1,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventeen million seniors would see their taxes go up by more than $2,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spending wasn't any better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here too, we thought the Democrats might be coming around. The day before the President's budget was released, my good friend, the Senior Senator from North Dakota, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to be tough on spending. The week after that, he went even farther, saying we should sharply inhibit the growth of spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then the curtain fell, and we saw the reality. The Democrats proposed to increase nonessential spending over the President's budget by nearly $150 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as if that wasn't enough, in addition to the tax hikes we could see, they set up 20 new accounts that they planned to fill up with money they had raised from a raft of new taxes they didn't even specify. Most of these funds are for worthy purposes. But let's be honest with the American people and pay for these programs by trimming waste, fraud, and abuse instead of open-ended tax hikes down the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans opened this Congress with a pledge to work with Democrats. We gave them a soaring economy and an offer to take advantage of divided government to do big things, as divided governments have in the past. One of the big things we proposed was entitlement reform. Every Member of this Chamber knows Social Security is unsustainable in its current form. Yet the budget writers ignored the problem altogether. They proposed to raise $916 billion in new taxes--and to spend it. Budget week is  when the rhetoric</paragraph>
    <paragraph>meets reality: and one of the sad realities this budget revealed was that Democrats weren't serious about reform this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh they will deny it. Just like they have tried to deny that the tax hikes in this budget are tax hikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After I and my colleagues pointed out the new taxes in this budget, the senior Senator from North Dakota rose to say that we were letting our imaginations get the better of us. He said the Democratic budget contained "no proposed tax increase."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then, one day after rising on the floor to insist that there were no new taxes in this budget, he and his Democratic colleagues admitted as much. They voted for an amendment that would reduce some of the more unsavory tax increases in their budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, you don't need to be Einstein to know that you can't lower a tax increase that doesn't exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The upshot of that amendment is that the budget we are now being asked to vote on no longer represents a tax hike four times larger than the previous record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are being asked to vote on a tax hike nearly three times bigger than the previous record--and, in the process, to get in the way of an economic expansion, increase nonessential spending by tens of billions of dollars, and do absolutely nothing about a pending entitlement crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans wouldn't do any one of those things, let alone all four. And we urge our colleagues on other side to reconsider the damage they plan to inflict on Americans who have worked hard to rebuild and reenergize this country over the last 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their current budget would squeeze three-quarters of a trillion dollars out of the American taxpayer without shaving so much as a dime from a single government program. This is the very definition of tax and spend. It represents a tremendous missed opportunity. And it is a terrible disappointment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Republicans proposed to accomplish big things, this isn't what we had in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget is a big mistake. Republicans can't support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Budget Committee for his efforts to include my bipartisan amendment to increase the allocation for LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to $3.2 billion in the budget resolution. As the chairman knows, this is the level that was recommended in a bipartisan letter signed by 35 governors and is the minimum level of funding needed to allow States to provide the same level of assistance as in fiscal year 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rise in energy prices has led to an increase in the number of families seeking and receiving assistance. In fiscal year 2006, with an additional $1 billion, over 500,000 additional households were served by LIHEAP, increasing the total to 5.6 million. However, that represents less than 15 percent of the eligible households.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LIHEAP is not only a heating program, it is also a cooling program. The number of households receiving cooling assistance increased to 540,000 in fiscal year 2006, up from 315,000 in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LIHEAP provides a vital safety net for our Nation's low-income households by helping them remain healthy and secure during bitterly cold winters in the North and hot summers in the South. For many low-income families, disabled individuals, and senior citizens living on fixed incomes, home energy costs are unaffordable. Low-income families pay close to 18 percent of their income on energy. The average family only pays 4 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent survey conducted by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, NEADA, families who receive LIHEAP are very poor and have few choices but to cut back on food, medicine, and other essentials in order to pay their home energy costs when funding is inadequate to meet the need. Sixty-four percent of those surveyed said that without LIHEAP, they would have had to keep their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature. Fifty-four percent said that they would have had  their electric or gas service disconnected if LIHEAP benefits had not been available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing funding for this vital and valuable program remains a top priority for me. I am grateful that the Senate has accepted this bipartisan amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to reiterate my comments from yesterday about this budget resolution. Chairman Conrad has worked tirelessly to ensure that this resolution meets the pressing needs of the American people and restores the fiscal discipline that has been lacking for several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been charting an unsustainable fiscal policy course over the last 6 years. Instead of a $505 billion surplus in 2006, Republican fiscal policies left us with a deficit of $248 billion. Reversing this course and restoring balance is essential to our economic well-being. This budget takes the necessary steps toward equilibrium by achieving a balanced budget by 2012 and providing funding for essential programs that improve the lives of hardworking Americans who have been struggling during  this sluggish economic recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It includes necessary funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP; a program that provides a vital safety net to millions of families who do not earn enough to buy health insurance for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget also includes language that allows for the establishment of an affordable housing fund financed by government-sponsored enterprises. This affordable housing fund will provide grants for the production, preservation, and rehabilitation of affordable housing for very low-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget resolution reinforces our commitment to America's veterans by including $43.1 billion for discretionary veterans' programs and rejecting the President's proposed increases in fees on veterans enrolled in the VA health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also pleased to see that this budget rejects the President's proposed cuts in funding for education and training programs and instead appropriately invests in these necessary endeavors, in part by including significant increases in funding for the Department of Education--$6.1 billion above the President's request and $4 billion above the FY07 inflation-adjusted level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Conrad and his staff for their hard work in producing this budget, which is both supportive of the needs of the American people and fiscally sound. I will support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last year on March 20, the President signed <bill type="s" number="2320">S. 2320</bill>, which augmented funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program. In light of the historically high energy costs, it was prudent to shift funding to accommodate for the reduced purchasing power of the vital program. As many of us know, disaster was narrowly averted last winter and the summer of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With heating oil at $2.45 a gallon in Maine, we must recognize that energy prices will continue to burden the citizens who are most susceptible to heat and cold in the coming fiscal year. As we know in each of our states, energy is a necessity of life during extreme weather. In fact, it has been found that 73 percent of households have been forced to cut back on, and even go without other necessities such as food, prescription drugs and mortgage and rent payments. The LIHEAP program is, for many  low-income families and our Nation's elderly, is the only barrier from nature's elements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program is a national program. In fiscal year 2006 LIHEAP assisted 5,710,000 households in the United States, including 48,000 households in Maine. In Fiscal Year 2006, the nearly 6 million households that received funding only represented 25 percent of the households eligible for assistance. Unfortunately, that figure illustrates that with the exponential rise in energy prices, this program has become an even more vital program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is also reflected in level of support from our Nation's governors. On February 15th, a bipartisan group of 35 governors wrote the leadership of the House and Senate stating that "In 2006, we were grateful that Congress made a significant investment in LIHEAP, recognizing that soaring energy prices required additional funding for the program." The letter further reads that, "We urge you to use the 2006 funding level of $3.2 billion as a base to build from in the future--not a one time  emergency investment in energy assistance." The letter was signed by governors with diverse political views and from a distinct regions including Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. This is a national program and, accordingly, it has national support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is incumbent on us to prepare the Nation's budget in light of the year's perceivable threats facing the United States and with our citizens in mind. Current energy prices present an impending crisis for the United State's most vulnerable. The LIHEAP program does not stem the effects of winter, but it quells the effects of energy prices and allays the fears of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that our Nation's budget should prioritize the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and believe that an increase of an additional $703 million represents a responsible and vital investment. I urge my colleagues to support this program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today, joined by Senators BEN NELSON, BAUCUS, GRASSLEY, KENNEDY, and SALAZAR, to offer a bipartisan amendment which creates a deficit neutral reserve fund that recognizes the significance of market-based pooling as a tool in addressing rising health insurance costs, and health care quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Market-based pooling is especially important for small businesses, which now have virtually no ability to use strength in numbers across State lines to negotiate better and more affordable coverage for their workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America faces an ever-widening gap between health care "haves" and "have nots." Without effective market pooling power, ever-growing numbers of small businesses and uninsured and underinsured Americans are slipping into the "have not" column. This is a tragic gap we can and must close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator NELSON and I are actively discussing with our colleagues possible  bipartisan approaches. As the wide bipartisan support for today's amendment shows, we are on a promising track, and we intend to stick with it. Market-based pooling must be a part of any comprehensive health reform solution.</paragraph>
