    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I visited DC Central Kitchen, where I learned about an innovative program, the Campus Kitchens Project. This is a program that uses high school and college dining facilities when the kitchen is normally closed to prepare meals for area soup kitchens and shelters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>College and high school students involved in this program take a large leadership role in starting and maintaining the kitchens. Campus Kitchens helps feed hungry people in our communities today, while building tomorrow's leaders committed to ending hunger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunger is a political condition, and we need government action to end it, but we also need people from all sectors dedicated to doing more to end hunger. There are over 400 high schools and 100 colleges in Massachusetts alone. If each school organized a group to fight hunger in their community, just think of what could be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate DC Central Kitchen and the Campus Kitchens project for their work, and I thank the staff and students for their commitment to ending hunger.</paragraph>
