    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 604, expressing the Nation's sincerest appreciation and thanks for the service of the members of the 303rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) upon the occasion of their final reunion. I thank my colleague from Michigan (Mr. McCotter) for bringing this measure before the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our history is rich with heroes who have risen above and beyond the call of duty in service to our great Nation. The American flag billows proudly above this Capitol building, and even more boldly behind your seat, Mr. Speaker, due to the extraordinary heroism of our servicemen in times of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 303rd Bombardment Group is certainly part of this legacy. Two 303rd Bombardment Group airmen, Technical Sergeant Forrest Vosler and First Lieutenant Jack Mathis, were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, four were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, 33 were awarded the Silver Star, approximately 1,200 Purple Hearts were awarded for those killed or wounded in action, and over 5,000 were listed as missing in action during World War II. While these numbers make me proud to be an American,  statistics alone cannot begin to comprehend the tremendous service they have done for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The members of the 303rd Bomb Group Association have provided opportunities for 303rd veterans, families and friends to meet, and have perpetuated the memory of the 303rd Bombardment Group comrades lost during World War II, since the organization was founded in 1975.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while the 303rd Bomb Group Association is meeting this week for the final time, the United States House of Representatives and our great Nation can express its sincerest thanks for their service by carrying forth the mission statement of the 303rd Bomb Group Association and making timeless the memory of their successes and sacrifices by memorializing their history in law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 604.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I speak in support of House Resolution 604, which expresses the Nation's appreciation and thanks for the servicemembers of the 303rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) upon the occasion of the final reunion of the 303rd Bomb Group Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate to learn that the 303rd Bomb Group Association will dissolve following their final reunion this week in Arlington, Virginia. The declining number of these courageous veterans makes it difficult for the association to continue their annual reunions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that being said, Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to the valiant men of the 303rd Bombardment Group known as "Hell's Angels."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Activated in February 1942 at Pendleton, Oregon, the 303rd was an Eighth Air Force Bomber Group that flew the mighty B-17 Flying Fortress out of Molesworth, England. Living up to their adopted motto, "Might in Flight," the air crews flew a record 364 combat missions against enemy targets, the most of any B-17 Bomb Group in the Eighth Air Force during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For its actions in the skies over Europe, the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation in January 1944, two of the heroic crew men of the 303rd were awarded with Congressional Medal of Honor, and four earned the Distinguished Service Cross.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of their accomplishments, the members of the Bomb Group paid a heavy price in casualties, aircraft losses, and capture by the enemy. Their determination to complete the mission regardless of the opposition or the odds carried them through their losses and on to victory in the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, given the history of outstanding service by the 303rd Bombardment Group during World War II, as well as the last reunion of the veterans of the 303rd taking place this week, it is fitting that we take the time today to recognize and honor their service. I therefore strongly urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the sponsor of the resolution and the chairman of the committee, the ranking member, and all of my colleagues who are joining me in support of honoring the heroic members of the 303rd Bombardment Group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has rightly been said that they were the greatest generation; and yet, it is important, through the adoption of resolutions and other instances, where we, as a people, recognize their sacrifice for the very liberty upon which our free Republic is founded, always remember that their service to our Nation did not end with World War II, for they continued in their transition to civilian life where they also helped form the foundation of our Nation. But it is also critical that, too, at this juncture,  where again another generation of Americans finds themselves tasked with defending freedom in its maximum hour of danger, that we never forget the example that these citizens, soldiers and airmen set for the rest of us, not just as a matter of history, but as a matter for our progeny that they may ever breathe free.</paragraph>
