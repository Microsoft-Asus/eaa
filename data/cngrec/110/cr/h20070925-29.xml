  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we will vote for legislation supporting the goals and ideals of Veterans of Foreign Wars Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly 100 years, the Veterans of Foreign Wars has served a straightforward and noble mission, honoring the dead by helping the living and by providing friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of New Hampshire, we have nearly 10,000 VFW members, another 4,500 members of the Ladies Auxiliary. I'm honored to be their representative in this House and to work with them to ensure that all of our veterans and their families receive the full support and benefits they have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VFW has been an outspoken advocate for veterans rights. It has called for expanded health care for veterans, increased funding for research into traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. It has also asked for improved access to health care and for veterans support for mental illnesses and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I met with my veterans advisory committee last fall, one prominent member of the VFW asked me to support a sufficient budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs. I am happy to report that the 110th Congress passed the largest budget in the 77-year history of the Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives has heard the call of the VFW and other veterans organizations and has passed bills to support and fund these critical issues.</paragraph>
