    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will immediately resume consideration of <bill type="h" number="1591">H.R. 1591</bill>, the supplemental appropriations bill, and begin the process of voting on amendments which remain in order. There are only five amendments which remain in order to the bill. I encourage all Members to remain in the Chamber for these votes so committees and other meetings that are taking place throughout the Capitol can go forward on schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of business to be conducted today. I extend my appreciation to all Senators, especially Senator McConnell, for helping us work through the morass we had yesterday. It was very difficult, but we worked through it, and I think it will allow us to get the bill to the President more quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all acknowledge that the bill is imperfect. That is what conferences are all about. Let's see what we can do to improve it in conference.</paragraph>
