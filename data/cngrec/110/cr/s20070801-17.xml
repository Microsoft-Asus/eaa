  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on proposed legislation to revise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to facilitate the electronic surveillance of targets reasonably believed to be outside the United States in order to obtain foreign intelligence information relating to international terrorism. When the act was passed in 1978, communications outside the United States were characteristically transmitted via satellite and were not covered by the act  which applied to wires. In the intervening 29 years, such communications now travel by wire and are covered by the act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The civil and constitutional rights of U.S. persons would ordinarily not be involved in electronic surveillance of targets outside the United States. If persons inside the United States were surveilled while targeting outside the United States, then the minimization procedures would reasonably protect  civil and constitutional rights of persons inside the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Director of National Intelligence, Michael McConnell, outlined the current threat, there is an urgent need to enact this legislation promptly, certainly before the Congress adjourns for the August recess. Such modifications to FISA should have been enacted long ago and legislation has been pending for months as proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein and myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned by provisions of the proposed legislation which would give extensive authority to the Attorney General. Regrettably, Attorney General Gonzales does not enjoy the confidence of many, if not most, Members of Congress. There is in the Congress generally considerable skepticism about the administration's Terrorist Surveillance Program because it was kept secret for so long and concerns continue to be expressed that some portions have still not been adequately explained to the public,  even where that might be done consistent with national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been considerable discussion among Members of the Senate raising at a minimum serious concerns and, beyond that, objections to giving Attorney General Gonzales any additional, even if temporary, authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Discussions have been undertaken with the Director of National Intelligence to substitute his position for that of the Attorney General; or, in the alternative, to substitute the Secretary of Homeland Security or some other official outside of the Department of Justice who has been confirmed by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am putting these concerns on the record now so that they may be considered and resolved at the earliest time so that legislation can be concluded before Congress adjourns for the August recess.</paragraph>
