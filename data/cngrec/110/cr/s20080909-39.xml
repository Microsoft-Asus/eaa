    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the board of directors and dedicated staff at Horizon Health Care on its 30th anniversary. In three decades, Horizon Health Care has been transformed into a pillar of the community by providing affordable health care to residents of rural South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning as a group of concerned citizens with hopes of providing quality, affordable health care in rural southwest South Dakota, Horizon Health Care began in 1978 as Miner-Hamlin Health Care and Tri-County Health Care. With the help of Federal funding and a steady influx of various physicians, the separate health care entities in the area finally merged in 1998, continuing their mission to serve the area. Horizon Health Care is governed by a volunteer board of directors, comprised of 16 members  representing the community, with John Mengenhausen being hired as the chief executive officer in 1983.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to congratulate the current and past directors and caregivers of Horizon Health Care on reaching this milestone for their business, and for their years of service to the community. Once again, I commend the individuals involved in this enterprise and am pleased to see them publicly honored.</paragraph>
