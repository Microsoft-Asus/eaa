    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in disbelief at the actions of the Democratic Senators' resolutions against the United States efforts in Iraq. These very same Senators voted unanimously to confirm General David Petraeus. It is unbelievably hypocritical to undermine the efforts of the very man they confirmed, along with all the brave men and women who serve with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The actions of these Senators will simply encourage the terrorists and undermine the U.S. efforts to succeed in Iraq and the war on terror. Republicans want to debate this issue, yet the Democrats only want to pass a resolution. It is time to take a real stand on the issue. If the Democrats want to end the war, then they should stand up and call for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hypocritical actions of the Democrats are wrong. They have offered no plan for success in Iraq and are interfering with the President's powers to execute a war that the Congress has already approved. Democrats must realize there is only one commander-in-chief, and it is his job and responsibility to manage the war as he sees fit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support my Republican colleagues in the Senate who want a real debate on this issue and victory in the central front on the global war on terror.</paragraph>
