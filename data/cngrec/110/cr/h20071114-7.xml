    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, more than 21,000 foreign-born men and women currently serve on active duty, willing to die in defense of our Nation. U.S. Navy Second Class Petty Officer Eduardo Gonzalez is one of these brave men, a naturalized U.S. citizen who has served two tours in the gulf region. Despite his valiant service, Eduardo Gonzalez faces the deportation of his wife Mildred. At age 5, she was brought here from Guatemala. Now, in addition to confronting enemies from abroad, Gonzalez  must confront a threat at home, losing the wife and mother of their 2-year-old child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his testimony before the Immigration Subcommittee, Gonzalez stated: As a citizen of the United States of America, it makes me wonder, if I can die for my country, then why am I not allowed to just be with my family?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like Petty Officer Gonzalez, immigrant soldiers fight with vigor and valor to protect the American Dream. All of those who serve, regardless of country of origin, are recognized as American heroes. As heroes, they deserve an immigration policy worthy of their sacrifices and nothing less.</paragraph>
