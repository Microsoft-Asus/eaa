  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO PETER CHERNIN -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10728">S10728</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield to no one in my support of the freedoms set out in the first amendment to the Constitution, and I have devoted considerable time and energy to their protection and preservation. On October 21, 2008, I enjoyed a very special evening honoring Peter Chernin, the CEO of Fox News, and a man who shares my belief in the need to vigorously defend the first amendment. That night, I congratulated Peter on receiving the Media Institute's First Amendment Award, an award  that he richly deserved for his stand against rigid and unyielding application of so-called indecency rules at the Federal Communications Commission. I believe that his words in defense of the first amendment should be heard and heeded by all Americans, not just by those who were fortunate enough to attend that event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Peter Chernin from October 21, 2008, be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Politics, Indecency, and the First Amendment</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you so much for that introduction, Senator Leahy. Your strong and unambiguous support for the First Amendment is legendary on Capitol Hill, and I could not be more pleased to have you, a former recipient of this award, as my presenter tonight. And thank you to the Media Institute for bestowing this honor on me. As the head of a media company, I am at times painfully aware of how important the First Amendment is to our ability to create thought-provoking and controversial content. And as  a citizen of this country, I am thankful every day for the freedoms that we too often take for granted: the freedom to speak freely, the freedom to pursue our religious beliefs without persecution, and the freedom of the press to criticize our government.</narrative>
  <narrative>We live in a pluralistic society. One where diversity rules, where disagreement is a constant, and where there is more than one right answer for every question. It's messy. And for creators of content, if we're doing our jobs right, we sometimes offend people. It's that simple. And, believe me, we wrestle with that fact. We struggle with complex issues every day. Are we guilty of contributing to the vulgarization of our society or simply of mirroring it? Is it our responsibility to be the arbiters  of good taste, or is it our duty to push boundaries? Is it even possible to create innovative programming for a mass audience that is diverse on every level--from age, to religious affiliation, to ethnicity?</narrative>
  <narrative>We don't take these issues lightly. We are constantly thinking about the important role we play in shaping our culture. Whether we're creating television shows, making films, or working at a newspaper or publishing house. Certainly, we must entertain, we must inform and we must provoke. But, at the same time, we must take very seriously the power we have to affect millions through our work. That's why we stress the importance of individual editorial responsibility across all of our businesses.  But, yes, sometimes we do make mistakes. Everyone does. The alternative? Well, it's chilling. If the media is ruled by fear of crossing an ambiguous line, our product will be less vital and more homogenous. Our ability to create news and entertainment that is thoughtful,</narrative>
  <narrative>Two weeks from today the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in FCC v. Fox Television Stations, the first indecency case it has heard since the "7 Dirty Words" case was decided in 1978. At issue is whether Fox violated the indecency law when it aired two live award programs in which actresses blurted out one or two so-called "fleeting expletives." While a case with Cher and Nicole Richie at its center is probably not one we would have chosen to argue before the Supreme Court, the truth  is, we don't get to  pick our cases. In fact, if anyone had told me that my company would be before the U.S.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is a certain symmetry to the fact that the oral argument in this case and the election of the 44th President of the United States are taking place on the same day: The Fox case, if successful, is an affirmation of the First Amendment. The election is an affirmation of our democratic process. And the two are inextricably intertwined. The First Amendment is central to our democratic process because it ensures a full and open dialogue about the candidates for office. Without the First Amendment,  our democracy could not be sustained.</narrative>
  <narrative>But the truth is, people don't think about defending broadcasters' right to utter expletives in the same way they think about defending one's right to speak critically of our government. But they should. The First Amendment is at stake in both cases. As a media company, we have not just a right but a responsibility to stand up to the government when it crosses that First Amendment line in the sand--even if the content we are defending is in bad taste. And in the indecency context, that line has  not only been crossed, it has been obliterated. That is why Fox is fighting the FCC in this and several other indecency cases.</narrative>
  <narrative>I'll admit: some of the content we are defending is not particularly tasteful: the expletives, the brief nudity, the carefully placed whipped cream and, of course, the pixels. I would not have allowed my own children, when they were younger, to watch some of these shows. But, I vow to fight to the end for our ability to put occasionally controversial, offensive, and even tasteless content on the air.</narrative>
  <narrative>Why? Because, if the government gets its foot in the censorship door with respect to unpopular entertainment content, it is the beginning of the steep slide toward censoring unpopular political content. And we have seen the beginnings of this downward slide in a recent case where the FCC initially found indecent content in a news program. If we allow our government to intrude into the creative process to censor the "bad words" at issue in the Fox case, I am afraid we will soon reach the bottom  of the slide--to America's detriment.</narrative>
  <narrative>Groups that claim to be interested in "protecting children" are helping the government along in its attempts to censor television. While I don't agree with these groups, I do fully support their right to criticize what's on television. But the job of protecting children is far too important to leave to government bureaucrats or so-called public interest groups. The job of protecting children lies with parents. The job of the government is to resist the views of interest groups with particular  agendas and instead to enforce the law in a way that is consistent, fair, and constitutional. So I don't blame these groups for the degradation of the First Amendment. I blame our government, which has succumbed to the views of a particularly vocal minority.</narrative>
  <narrative>Look, I am not insensitive to the fact that young children need to be protected. And that's difficult in an era of single parent, or two working parent households. But the protection of children must be considered in a Twenty-First Century light. Nearly every TV set sold today includes a V-Chip, which allows parents to block content they think may be inappropriate for their children. Cable, satellite, and telco video providers have finely-tuned, comprehensive parental controls. And let's not  forget the most powerful technology available to parents: the on-off switch. These tools allow adults to protect their kids while still being able to access shows they love.</narrative>
  <narrative>We as media companies also have a responsibility: to rate shows accurately and consistently so the V-Chip works as it should. And, as I said earlier, we need to be responsible with our creative output. This is something we do on a daily basis through our Standards and Practices departments, not only by exercising editorial judgment but by constantly fine-tuning and improving our internal controls.</narrative>
  <narrative>Let's step back for a minute and get some perspective on this issue. The indecency law applies only to broadcast TV: that's a handful of channels. Over 85 percent of the country receives their broadcast channels through a cable, telco line, or satellite signal. Sitting right next to the broadcast channels on these multichannel systems are hundreds of other channels that are not subject to the indecency law.</narrative>
  <narrative>And those other channels are just a click away on the remote control. Nor does the indecency law apply to video-on-demand, pay per view, DVDs, or the mother of all content providers: the Internet. Does it really make sense to continue government censorship of the occasional bad word, brief nudity, or sexual innuendo on a handful of broadcast channels when we live in an environment of infinitely unregulated choices? In the media-rich world we live in, singling out a few channels for indecency  enforcement is not legally sustainable.</narrative>
  <narrative>Quite simply, it is time for the government to get out of the business of regulating "indecent" speech on broadcast TV. The threat it poses to core First Amendment values cannot be justified in our technologically diverse world. Parents have the tools to decide what is appropriate for their children. Let's let parents do their job and fire the government from the job of censoring speech. The First Amendment is too important to our democratic society--in this and future elections--to allow any  encroachments to threaten our country's critical freedoms.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you.</narrative>
