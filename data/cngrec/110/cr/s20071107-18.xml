    <paragraph>Madam President, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Detroit Repertory Theatre, one of Michigan's oldest, continuously operating professional theatre companies. Located in the heart of Detroit, this theatre company has made significant contributions to the arts landscape in Detroit and across Michigan, forging an enduring legacy over the last half century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The arts play an important role in building and sustaining communities by bridging cultural, ethnic, economic differences, and by being an important economic catalyst. Since its inception in 1957, the Detroit Repertory Theatre has been at the forefront of this effort and has provided world-class theatre productions for the greater Detroit community. Its ongoing emphasis on racially and ethnically diverse casting and its focus on theatrical relevancy have allowed it to carve out an important niche  in the grassroots theatre world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Detroit Repertory Theatre's golden anniversary is particularly impressive considering the myriad challenges grassroots theatre companies face. This theatre company has not only weathered and adeptly overcome every challenge but continues to provide quality performances, while focusing on making their productions both relevant and accessible to the community. Integral to the theatre's mission is reaching out to a broader theatre audience through various successful outreach efforts, including  Arts in Education Programs, Free Acting Workshops, the New Playwrights' Program, and the Charitable and CMO Partnerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>True to its bold tradition of forging ahead, this anniversary not only celebrates past achievements but concurrently looks forward and embarks on new challenges. On Saturday, the Detroit Repertory Theatre will hold a black tie benefit to formally celebrate its golden anniversary and to kickoff its 50th Anniversary Challenge. This effort seeks to raise the funds necessary to execute its operational and community development initiatives, seeking to position the theatre to meet the challenges that  lie ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When an organization enjoys the type of success the Detroit Repertory Theatre has over the years, there are many who have sacrificed much and deserve acknowledgement and our heartfelt gratitude. It is in this spirit that I know my colleagues join me in recognizing and congratulating all those who have contributed to the Detroit Repertory Theatre's many successes over the last 50 years, in particular Bruce Milan, an original cofounder and the theatre's artistic and managing director, as well as  his fellow cofounders, Barbara Busby and Dee Andrus. The community looks forward to an equally impressive record of success over the next half century. Break a leg!</paragraph>
