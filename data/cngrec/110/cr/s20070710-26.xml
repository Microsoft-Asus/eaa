  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 101st anniversary of Follansbee, WV--a great community with great people and an important part of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Follansbee is a town whose legacy was forged in steel. Its 3,000 residents are descendants of history and carry with them a proud tradition of tenacity and pride. While Follansbee sits in the northern panhandle of West Virginia, squeezed between Ohio and Pennsylvania on the banks of the Ohio River, it plays an integral role in West Virginia's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Follansbee Steel was the first company to locate in this small Brooke County town, joining steel makers throughout the Ohio River Valley in firing the industrial revolution and feeding the Nation's voracious appetite for steel as it grew. Follansbee Steel's state-of-the-art roofing products also appeared in the early 19th century and played a major role in post-Civil War Reconstruction. Later, these materials became the products of choice for Frank Lloyd Wright, one of the world's most prominent  architects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, when brothers John and Robert Follansbee bought the steel mill near the turn of the 20th century, not only did they rename the mill, they were the catalyst for forming what is now the city of Follansbee. Before that anyone traveling north of Wellsburg along the river would refer to Mahan's Junction--the name of the owners of the large orchard formerly on the site of Follansbee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this day, the 101st anniversary of its founding, it is appropriate to look to the future which, I am happy to note, looks bright for Follansbee, WV. As the years have passed, the tradition of Follansbee Steel remains through the town's reservoir of high-quality labor. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, a successor of Follansbee Steel, continues to run one of the busiest coke plants in the country, feeding both its blast furnace and its electric arc furnace, while Wheeling-Nisshin is now one of the  largest hot-dip coating mills in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wheeling Nisshin came to West Virginia in the early 1980s as our very first Japanese business. Since that time we have seen Japanese companies embrace West Virginia throughout the State. This joint venture between a Japanese steel company and Wheeling Pitt was years ahead of its time, taking advantage of the increasing globalization of the steel industry and using it to West Virginia's advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With its large industry and its small businesses and local professionals, Follansbee is just the type of small American town we think of and in which we take pride. It is a community with strong roots and a tremendous sense of local pride. Each summer its residents gather for Follansbee Community Days, bringing residents, their families, and former residents together from far and wide to celebrate their shared sense of community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in marking this 101st anniversary of the founding of Follansbee. The legacy of that town is long, its history rich--but it is the service it has provided the country that will be felt for a long, long time.  To mayor Tony Paesano and the people of Follansbee, may the next 101 years be as successful and peaceful as the first.</paragraph>
