  <narrative>HONORING HUSSON COLLEGE -- (Senate - October 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10319">S10319</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor one of the jewels of Maine higher education, Husson College, in Bangor, ME, which will officially make its much-anticipated transition to Husson University on October 11, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I join with countless Husson students and alumni from practically every town in Maine, as well as from around the country and the world, in expressing my deep-seated pride in what Husson College has accomplished since its founding in 1898 by Chesley Husson, and for what it will achieve in the years ahead as Husson University. Although the name has changed, the longstanding hallmarks of Husson which have served its students so exceptionally well for 110 years will not only remain the same,  but will also be strengthened more than ever. A broader-based institution than it was just 20 years ago, Husson--at this watershed moment of becoming a university--secures an even greater presence on the educational landscape, offering multiple degrees through various schools and bolstering its overall capacity to bring to its students a wide range of dynamic and diverse programs, especially at the graduate level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the dawn of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st, Husson has, at its core, strived to prepare its graduates for success in life and in professional careers, by cultivating a learning discipline, regimen, and environment tailored to each student that ultimately facilitates individual growth and progress. Ushering Husson College--now Husson University--into the 21st century is, fittingly, its 21st president, Dr. Bill Beardsley, who, since 1987, has been continually drawing from Husson's  rich past, while simultaneously focusing on what lies just over the horizon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Bill's unsurpassed vision, Husson is still--and will forever be--an institution focused on teaching rather than research--a place for imparting and acquiring knowledge that both fosters student development and equips its graduates with the educational tools to be valued civic and business leaders. Furthermore, because of Bill's unparalleled reputation and ingenuity as an innovator, Husson has also been at the forefront of developing a cutting-edge curriculum that takes into account marketplace  changes, demographic shifts, and economic trends. So, it is little wonder that under Bill's vibrant and effective leadership, Husson has more than tripled its matriculation of freshman students, more than doubled its number of tradition-&#xD0;al undergraduates--when considering those attending the New England School of Communications--and has undergone a stunning expansion on its campus to accommodate new schools and programs, not to mention more alumni.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing speaks more to Husson's tradition of commitment to the student--and the primacy of a hands-on education that is accessible and affordable--than a student-to-teacher ratio that is an exceptional 19 to 1, 70 faculty members dedicated only to teaching in the classroom, and tuition costs that are purposely kept from skyrocketing, and where nearly 90 percent of Husson students qualify to receive Federal, State, community, or campus-based financial aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, as Husson espouses a teaching emphasis emblematic of a college, it offers curriculum possibilities that integrate liberal arts and sciences, professional and technical studies, and learning outside the classroom that are indicative of its status as a university. Many schools may offer degrees in business, but at Husson, that area of study can be specialized to include not only financial management, but also hospitality management, small/family business management, and sports management--compelling  and rigorous pathways of learning that can be significantly attractive to highly-motivated, professionally-centered students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair and now ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreurship, I can tell you firsthand that this approach to business education that creates greater personalization yields benefits in an increasingly competitive marketplace for employers and prospective employees alike. And those rewards extend beyond the boundaries of business classes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, how many schools nationwide have a chemistry major that contains a prepharmacy track or paralegal studies or boatbuilding technology program or graduate programs in nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and a graduate course of study in pharmacy being developed? And how many institutions would have responded to a medical shortage in underserved, rural areas that could not afford a doctor with the vision of producing nurse practitioners? But that is precisely what Husson  did in 1981 when it partnered with Eastern Maine Medical Center to establish the Husson College/Eastern Maine Medical Center Baccalaureate School of Nursing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Husson is continually assessing and examining ways to be of greater value both to its students and the communities Husson serves. Husson's desire to address real-world challenges by innovatively calibrating fields of discipline is in part what makes Husson stand out--and frankly unique--in the pantheon of small universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just as Husson looks to meet its students more than halfway in developing their academic, individualized pursuits, Husson also endeavors to make receiving a Husson education more achievable for more Maine students with its education centers in South Portland, Presque Isle, and just recently, The Boat School in Eastport, ME, as well as Unobskey College, located in Calais, ME.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as much as Husson provides to its students, its graduates return the favor with an allegiance and a desire to give back to their alma mater that is awe inspiring. There is a story that Bill Beardsley recounted recently in a Bangor Metro article about a young man, the first of his family to attend college and a Husson student, who is able to attend Husson because of a gift from his grandfather. But the young man came to Bill because that money was running out and to explain his situation.  Dr. Beardsley knew he was a good student and a credit to the Husson community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between the two of them, they were determined to find a solution. Bill offered, among other items, a small loan. Together, they made it work, which is truly the Husson way, treating every student personally and as an individual, whether it is considering one's major to arriving at a payment plan in order to spur their trajectories as students and as human beings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is been a long time since Husson's days of preparing students for careers in commerce, teaching and telegraphy, or since it purchased a dairy farm that it converted beautifully into its present idyllic campus. And bridging the span of those years are Paul Husson, Chesley Husson's grandson, who still works at the university, and Husson graduate and legend, Clara Swan, former Husson coach, athletic director, professor, and Dean for whom the Swan Center is named.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They understand better than anyone that, while Husson may transition from a college to a university, and even though new disciplines may emerge, the Husson experience and outlook on education endures, from--to paraphrase part of the Husson mission statement--its dedication to excellence in teaching, its adherence to forging a personalized collegiate experience with  its students, its development of individual self-worth, and a curriculum which promotes  clear thinking and communication skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The college that time and again was the defining force behind so many students and graduates in the last century will now be the university that will propel new generations into this age and beyond, and it will do so with the same bedrock foundation that places the individual education of each student first and the forward-looking focus that enables Husson students and graduates to set and reach any goal. Husson University understands, conveys, and puts into action what the English poet, Robert  Browning, once so eloquently expressed in words "a man's reach should exceed his grasp or what's a Heaven for?"</paragraph>
