  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as prices at the pump continue to hit record highs, the time has come to put partisanship behind us and come together to work and solve the problems to help American people who are struggling to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We enacted legislation to inject into the market an additional 70,000 barrels of oil per day by suspending shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve beginning two weeks from today. We raised auto fuel efficiency standards for the first time in 30 years. And we are nearing completion of a bill to regulate the speculators who manipulate the price of oil in the worldwide market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress has been proactive in doing everything we can to address the problem. Rather than pointing fingers, casting blame and trying to score cheap political points, I hope the minority in this Congress will join us in our effort to take swift and decisive action to address the rising price of gas.</paragraph>
