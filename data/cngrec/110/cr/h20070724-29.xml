    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I know this is beginning to sound like a broken record, but the "Hold on to Your Wallet Congress" is at it again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's latest episode, the liberal leadership has proposed another spending bill that will most likely be dead on arrival when it hits the President's desk because it shows disrespect for the taxpayers' dollar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat Transportation-HUD spending bill provides for a whopping $104.4 billion in spending for the next fiscal year, which is more than $4 billion in new spending and more than $2.8 billion above what the President requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation increases spending for earmarks. And it does fail to address the very real solvency issues of the highway trust fund, which will face a $4 billion shortfall in 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is irresponsible, sets the wrong priorities, and adds to the already staggering level of additional new spending in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current Congress pledged to curb runaway spending, but instead they have moved it to the fast lane and they've set the pedal to the metal to see how fast they can spend your dollar.</paragraph>
