  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - December 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15380">S15380</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the farm bill and conduct a period of debate until 9:15. This debate time is equally divided between the leaders or their designees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 9:15 the Senate will conduct two back-to-back rollcall votes. The first vote will be in relation to the Dorgan-Grassley payment limitations amendment. That amendment is subject to a 60-vote threshold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second vote will be a cloture vote on the motion to concur to an amendment to <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will continue with other amendments and votes with respect to the farm bill today, so Members can expect other votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would remind all Members that we will likely be in recess from 2 to 3 p.m. because Admiral McConnell and Attorney General Mukasey will conduct a secret briefing in room 407. This is prefatory to the debate that will take place soon on the FISA bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to do our very best to finish the farm bill today. We have 23 amendments left on the farm bill. We have a lot to do. We are going to do everything we can do so that we do not have to be in session this weekend. It will take cooperation from Members because there are a number of issues that we have to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to try to finish the farm bill and the Energy bill today. We have a lot of other things to do today. Hopefully, we can get agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say this to all Senators: We are past the point where you can just have your staff call the cloakroom and say: I have a Senator who objects. If somebody wants to object, we are not going to take cloakroom calls during these last few days of the session. We are not going to accept that.</paragraph>
