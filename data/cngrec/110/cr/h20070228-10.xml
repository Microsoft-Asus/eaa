  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush recently released his seventh budget, and it is more of the same. The Bush administration's 2008 budget continues the same fiscal irresponsibility of the past 6 years, sending us spiraling ever further into debt while failing to address this Nation's critical issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this administration and past Republican-led Congresses, they took a 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion left over from the Clinton administration and turned it into a $8.2 trillion deficit that mortgages our children's future. Despite the President's continuous promise to balance the budget by 2012, the current budget gets us no closer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this budget is not only fiscally irresponsible, it is morally irresponsible. We should not be piling mounds of debt owed to foreign nations onto the backs of America's children, while giving massive tax cuts to the wealthiest few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats are working to restore fiscal responsibility, economic prosperity for all and pay-as-you-go policy to the Federal budget. It is time the President joined us. The American people already have.</paragraph>
