    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize one of the most beloved heritages in my home State of Arkansas, our national forests. Arkansas is blessed with two National Forest Systems, the Ouachita National Forest and the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests. Last year, we recognized the 100th Anniversary of the Ouachita National Forest which stretches from western Arkansas to southeastern Oklahoma. On March 6, 2008, the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests will take their turn and celebrate  their centennial anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 100 years, the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests have protected our Nation's timber resources while also providing Americans with numerous outdoor and recreational opportunities. What is unique is that they are two completely separate and distinct forests but are managed together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt set aside lands that spanned the Ozark Mountains and named it the Ozark National Forest. His goal was to conserve and safeguard the hardwood  timberlands in our State, and it was one of the first efforts in our country's history to protect our Nation's valuable forests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Ozark National Forest contains a little more than 1.2 million acres and runs across northern Arkansas to the Oklahoma border. It is a diverse forest that harbors more than 500 different types of trees and other woody plants. Moreover, it is home to the tallest mountain in the State of Arkansas, Mount Magazine, outside Paris, AR, and includes a living underground cave system, Blanchard Spring Caves, near Mountain View, AR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A little more than 50 years after President Roosevelt created the Ozark National Forest, President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a proclamation to set aside 22,000 additional acres in Arkansas. Named the St. Francis National Forest, it is one of the smallest forests in the National Forest System. The St. Francis Forest begins in the hilly Crowley's Ridge section of eastern Arkansas and runs along the St. Francis River to the Mississippi River in the delta flatlands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each forest has its own unique character, geography, and topography, but together, they form the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The headquarters is located in Russellville, AR, at the Henry R. Koen Forest Service Office Building. The building is named for the man who supervised the Ozark National Forest from 1922-1939. The Henry R. Koen Building is a landmark in and of itself. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal work relief program during the Great Depression, it was dedicated in 1939. In April 1979, the building was named in Mr. Koen's honor after legislation was introduced in Congress by my predecessor,  Senator Dale Bumpers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate this milestone, I also want the forest supervisors in Arkansas to know that I am continuing to fight for them in the U.S. Senate. They oversee some of the largest national forests in the South. Traditionally, our forest management and conservation programs have been highly productive, efficient, and profitable, benefitting taxpayers, local economies, and the region. However, with limited resources, our forest supervisors face considerable challenges in accessing and managing all  of the forests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I sent a letter with the entire Arkansas Congressional delegation to the Bush administration to express our support for greater resources for our State's national forests. Currently, our forest supervisors are only able to implement one half of their total forest management plan. Furthermore, damage from recent tornadoes has compounded the need for resources to access salvageable timber in the most efficient and timely manner possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my belief that additional investment in Arkansas's national forests will allow Arkansans to continue enjoying them for another 100 years and beyond.</paragraph>
