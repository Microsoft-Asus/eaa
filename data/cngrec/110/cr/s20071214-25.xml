  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, section 302 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation that improves certain services for and benefits to wounded or disabled military personnel and retirees, veterans, and their survivors and dependents. Section 302 authorizes the revisions provided that the legislation does not worsen the deficit over either the period of the  total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that the conference report accompanying <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for veterans and wounded service members. Therefore, pursuant to section 302, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> printed in the Record.</paragraph>
