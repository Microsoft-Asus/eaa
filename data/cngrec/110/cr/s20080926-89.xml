    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have the distinct honor of rising today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of a true Michigan success story, the founding of General Motors Corporation. It was 100 years ago this month that a man named Billy Durant who, after years in the horse-drawn carriage business, founded General Motors in Flint, MI. Durant had taken the helm at a small motor car company called Buick, and, in September 1908, incorporated it into General Motors. Under his stewardship, Buick  became the best-selling brand in the world, affording Durant the opportunity to buy a number of other small companies including Oldsmobile, Cadillac, and the company that would eventually be known as Pontiac. Later he started Chevrolet and brought it into General Motors as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the century that followed its incorporation, GM would become the largest company in the world, driven by the goal articulated by Alfred Sloan, president of GM in the 1920s and 1930s, to build "a car for every purse and purpose." In that pursuit, the company time and again originated innovations that continue to benefit consumers to this day, ranging from the closed-body car, 1910, to the electric starter, 1912, to mass-produced automatic transmissions, 1940, to pollution controls, 1963,  to airbags, 1973, to the catalytic converter, 1974.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the intertwined nature of the company with this nation's economic growth extends far beyond innovative technological contributions and even beyond balance sheets and metrics for economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can ask just about anyone, "What's the heartbeat of America?" And years after that slogan last passed across our television screens, people still know the answer is Chevrolet. And of course many Americans heeded the good advice to "See the USA in your Chevrolet." Cadillac has become a ubiquitous synonym for quality. The Pontiac GTO defined an era of muscle cars. The legendary "409" block engine became an American icon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Second World War, GM provided more than $12 billion of goods to support the Allied effort, more than any other company. The company also played critical roles in the navigation system that sent Americans to the moon for the first time, and designed and built the lunar rover, which was used by astronauts to travel around the Moon in subsequent trips.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, GM employs more than 250,000 people, and in 2007 sold nearly 9.37 million cars and trucks. And its next century is filled with promise. As the GM marketing team has noted, in 2008 we are in the middle of an American revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The company that helped to make Michigan the arsenal of Democracy is working on fuel cells that can make help break our democracy's dependence on foreign oil. The company that invented the electric starter is going to be a leader in bringing a plug-in hybrid, the Volt, to consumers. The company that brought consumers the first automatic transmission is striving to bring consumers the first zero-emissions commute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my congratulations to the entire GM family on 100 remarkable years, and wish them all the best in keeping the pedal to the metal for 100 more.</paragraph>
