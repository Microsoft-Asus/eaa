  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory of Jeff Erlanger, an extraordinary person who was a prominent member of the Madison community, a family friend, and an inspiration to me and everyone lucky enough to know him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To understand what a positive force Jeff was in people's lives, I will quote something he said in an ad he did for Wisconsin Public Television a few years ago: "It doesn't matter what I can't do--what matters is what I can do." Those are words that everyone should live by, but Jeff, who was a quadriplegic, really did live by them. He never dwelled on the many challenges he faced; instead, he focused on helping others, making tremendous contributions of time and effort to a wide array of organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served on the Economic Development Commission, as chairman of the Commission on People with Disabilities, and as chairman of the board of the Community Living Alliance, as well as many other positions. Among his accomplishments was his successful push for the accessible taxicab service that exists in Madison today. He also ran for the Madison City Council in 2002. Jeff's commitment to public service says volumes about the kind of person he was and why his passing is such a loss for the Madison  community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeff used his personal experience to inspire others, visiting classrooms to talk about living with a disability, and appearing on "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" at the age of 10. He became good friends with Fred Rogers, speaking both at Rogers' induction to the Television Academy Hall of Fame and at a memorial service when Rogers passed away in 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his adulthood, he continued to make life-changing connections with people he met. Incredibly, he saved the life of a Boston woman he was talking with online, calling both AOL and the Boston police after she told him she had cut her wrists but wouldn't tell him what her last name was or where she lived. They tracked the woman down and rushed her to an emergency room. It is just one amazing story from a truly amazing life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to say that Jeff was an intern in my office. He was also a dear friend to members of my family. He meant so much to so many people, both those he knew, those he inspired through his appearances, and those he helped through his life of community service. I am deeply saddened by his passing, and my thoughts are with his parents, his family, and his friends. Jeff left behind a wonderful legacy, of hope, enthusiasm, and caring, and that is something everyone who knew him can cherish.</paragraph>
