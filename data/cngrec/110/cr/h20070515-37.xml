    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1505">H.R. 1505</bill>, as amended, is a bill to designate the Federal building in Davenport, IA, as the James A. Leach United States Courthouse. Our former colleague, Jim Leach, was elected to Congress in 1977 from Iowa and served for 14 consecutive Congresses. His contributions to and interests in the House of Representatives are numerous, including his longstanding support for the use of HOPE VI HUD funds to help smaller cities develop affordable housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A career public servant, Congressman Leach served 30 years as a Representative in Congress, where he chaired the Banking and Financial Services Committee, the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, and the Congressional Executive Commission on China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He holds eight honorary degrees, has received decorations from two foreign governments, and is the recipient of the Wayne Morris Integrity in Politics Award, the Woodrow Wilson Award from Johns Hopkins, and the Adlai Stevenson Award from the United Nations Association, and the Edgar Wayburn Award from the Sierra Club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Leach was hard working, highly respected on both sides of the aisle, and dedicated to the welfare of his constituents. It is fitting and proper to honor his public service with this designation. I support 1505 and urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1505">H.R. 1505</bill> designates the United States courthouse located at 131 East 4th Street in Davenport, IA, as the James A. Leach United States Courthouse. The bill honors Congressman Leach's dedication to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Leach began his long and distinguished career of public service as a congressional staffer in the 1960s. He later served as a foreign service officer and as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976 Congressman Leach was elected to the House of Representatives. He served in the U.S. House for 30 years, from 1977 to 2007. During his time in Congress, he chaired the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, and the Congressional Executive Commission on China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congressman Jim Leach was a very decent, distinguished and thoughtful Member of Congress. He was a learned Member of the body. He's a personal friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served this country in many capacities. He began his service as a staff  member for then-Congressman Don Rumsfeld. He went to the State Department in 1968. He served as special assistant to director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. He served in capacities with the United Nations, with the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Education and Cultural Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served in an advisory capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, rather well-rounded career before being elected to Congress one term after I was elected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He chaired, at one point, the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the Subcommittee on Asian Pacific Affairs, and the Congressional Executive Commission on China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He, along the way, collected a number of honorary degrees. He's the recipient of the Wayne Morris Integrity in Politics Award, the Woodrow Wilson award from Johns Hopkins University, the Adlai Stevenson Award from the United Nations Association, and an award from the Sierra Club, the Edgar Wayburn award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He's now serving on the faculty of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs as a visiting professor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He's been ably succeeded by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack), and I really congratulate him and the entire Iowa delegation for so graciously and thoughtfully introducing and supporting this bill to honor one of Congress's most respected and well-liked Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are rare people who pass through this body and leave with good feelings and with good memories by those of us who continue to serve, and Jim Leach is one of those. It is very appropriate to designate the U.S. courthouse at Davenport, Iowa, in his honor, in his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, I really express my great admiration to the Iowa delegation for so recognizing this distinguished former Member of Congress. His service in no way takes away from the service of Mr. Loebsack who succeeded him, who is, himself, a distinguished professor, has distinguished himself in the arena of public policy during his college teaching career, and brings that same thoughtfulness and constructiveness to the public policy process that his predecessor did, whom we honor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and respect the memory of Jim Leach.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for yielding. And I thank the gentleman from Iowa for bringing this resolution to honor our good friend and colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we are proud, as Iowans, to stand here today and ask for support for this resolution to name the building in Davenport the James A. Leach Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look back on his career, what a stellar career. All of these years, elected to Congress in 1976, served till the end of the 109th Congress, a couple of days into this year, actually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And one of the things that stands out with Jim Leach is Jim Leach was a champion. He was a champion in 1960 as a State wrestling champion, and I'd point out to our wrestling champions here in this Congress, a State wrestling champion in Iowa is like being a national champion someplace else, just to set humility aside for the moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that is a characteristic that Jim Leach had, the characteristic of real humility and the characteristic of a champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as he came here to Congress and he began that long tenure that was here, he touched a lot of different issues. But his history and his experience in the financial industry was unparalleled in the contemporary Congress. And I know of no period in previous history when there's been someone that's been so respected, that has taken such leadership in the financial affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as chairman of the Finance Committee, and then later on as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Relations, Jim Leach was a leader that was respected on both sides. He was, some would call him a bipartisan legislator. I would say Jim Leach was a nonpartisan Member of this Congress. He evaluated each one of those issues that came before him, drew an independent judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if you might question his independence, I'll also make a concession on Congressman Leach in that he didn't always have every bit of his hair in place and he led sometimes with a sweater underneath his jacket, and it was only picked up by Senator Grassley as a stylish tip. But that's because Jim Leach followed his own mission, his own conscience, his own intellect and, in fact, he used his time to focus on those issues that were the good things for Americans, good things for Iowans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm proud today to stand in support of this resolution and proud to be able to call Jim Leach a colleague and a friend in the opposite order. It's with great admiration I ask support for this resolution of this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today to offer <bill type="h" number="1505">H.R. 1505</bill>. This bill designates the United States Federal building located at 131 East 4th Street in Davenport, Iowa, the James A. Leach United States Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Leach represented Iowa with grace and distinction for 30 years, and this legislation is a tribute to his service. His legacy of statesmanship, his leadership in foreign affairs and financial services is already recounted. His dedication to public service and his capable representation of his constituents left a lasting impact on the district I am now honored to represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim is a native son of Iowa; and throughout his time in Congress, his representation of the State was based upon the values of the people he represented and of the town in which he grew up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim recently joined the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, his alma mater. As a former professor myself, and I say former now, I believe I can say with some authority that the experience and knowledge that Jim has brought to the Woodrow Wilson School has no doubt been a tremendous asset for Princeton students and faculty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, as a professor at Cornell College in Iowa, I was pleased to invite Jim to campus to lecture on foreign policy matters. His talks were always informative and engaging. I know that these guest lectures were only a glimpse of the knowledge, the depth of the knowledge and expertise that Jim has brought to Princeton on a daily basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That he chose to continue his commitment to public service by training the next generation of scholars and practitioners is indicative of Jim's time in Congress, and I wish him the best of luck in his new career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Jim for his many years of service. It is my hope that I am able to represent Iowa's Second District as capably as he did for so many years. And I join with my colleagues and urge you to pass this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Latham).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400234" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker for the time to rise in support of this resolution to honor our great friend, Jim Leach, by naming the courthouse in Davenport, Iowa, after him. It is a well-deserved honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I miss Jim Leach around here because of his great sense of humor, his insight, his thoughtfulness, someone who was a strong Iowa Hawkeye supporter, having the Hawks in his district, and I, myself, representing Iowa State, so we used to go back and forth an awful lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Leach will be remembered here in this body for his 30 years of service, his great thoughtfulness, his intellect, someone who, whether it be in financial services, and the Financial Services Modernization Act bears his name, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill; whether it be trying to stop gambling predators over the Internet; someone who knew and understood international policy, foreign affairs like no one else; someone who had such a broad breadth of knowledge, who could bring that forth and convey  it to other folks in a very kind and thoughtful way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He does represent the very best of what's in this Congress, and that is a spirit of bipartisanship, of thought over politics, of actions rather than posturing; someone who I have the greatest personal respect for. And I'm so pleased that Mr. Loebsack has  brought this resolution to the floor of the House, and I would urge everyone to support this resolution in honor of James Leach. And I want to commend him, also his wife, Deva, and the family;  just wonderful people, and an honor like this could not go to a nicer person or a more deserving individual.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to add my voice, expressing the appreciation to Mr. Loebsack and to the Iowa delegation for bringing this resolution forward commemorating the service of our friend and former colleague, Jim Leach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 30 years that we were privileged in this body to watch him at work, the words, the recitation to what Jim Leach did doesn't do him justice. He was dignified and principled, one of the few people who could navigate these Halls successfully without ever being mired in partisan politics, doing it his way, a way that was right for the country, if often difficult for him politically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just reciting the facts misses the quality of his service. Jim Leach predicted the savings and loan crisis. He was spot on in his observations about American diplomacy from the Middle East to North Dakota. I meant to say North Korea, probably North Dakota as well, as I think about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He, as an example of his principled nature, resigned from the Foreign Service in protest of President Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his congressional campaigns, he was one of the few people who refused to accept PAC contributions and out of State donations. He wouldn't run negative ads, and he tried to stop outside groups who were supporting him from, in turn, running negative ads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1997, he refused to vote for Speaker Newt Gingrich because of deep ethics concerns. And while it was the right thing to do, as history has shown, it was a tough vote against a sitting Speaker in your own party. But it was an example of how Jim Leach operated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He correctly predicted what was going to happen with our ill-advised adventure in Iraq with great clarity and force in committee and on the floor. And then he voted against it, again, at some difficulty for himself politically, particularly at that time. That wasn't the direction of the prevailing winds in his party or in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that's how Jim Leach was. He thought about issues. He analyzed them. He shared his analysis in his own thoughtful, understated way. He was usually right, and the congressional deliberations were better as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say that I'm sorry that President Bush chose not to take the advice of dozens of Members in this body on both sides of the aisle who urged that Jim Leach be appointed as the U.S. Representative to the United Nations, a post for which he would be eminently well qualified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I am confident we will see a new chapter in his distinguished career whether in the United Nations, perhaps in a new administration. As a friend, a colleague and an American, I look forward to whatever that next chapter is in Jim's career.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would love to stand with the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentlewoman from Texas in urging our colleagues to vote for this. He was a good individual.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, and thanks to Congressman Loebsack for introducing this bill and working hard to designate the James A. Leach Courthouse in Davenport, Iowa. I would also like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica for reporting this bill out of Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Leach is a good man who served his constituents with distinction and grace, and it is fitting that we honor him with a hometown reminder of his commitment and service to Iowa. While his career in Congress was distinguished and honorable, I want to touch on another passion of his--wrestling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Leach began wrestling in his birthplace of Davenport as a seventh-grader. As a student at Davenport High School, he won the 1960 state wrestling championship at the 138-pound weight class. Competing for Princeton University, he lost just one dual meet match. Later, as a research student at the London School of Economics, he went on to compete in freestyle matches. In 1995, he was awarded the Outstanding American Award from the National Wrestling Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His wrestler's spirit was evident in his public service, as he took a disciplined and hard working approach to his duties. For thirty years, Congressman Leach served his constituents, and he never lost touch of his Davenport roots. As an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="1505">HR 1505</bill>, I am proud to support the James A. Leach Courthouse.</paragraph>
