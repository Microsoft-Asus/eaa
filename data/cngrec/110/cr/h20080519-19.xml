    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1771">H.R. 1771</bill>, the Crane Conservation Act, was introduced by our colleague from Wisconsin, Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin. The overall purpose of <bill type="h" number="1771">H.R. 1771</bill> is to assist in the conservation of the world's 15 species of crane, such as the whooping crane and the sandhill crane in North America. The bill would establish a new Crane Conservation Fund to finance Federal matching grants supporting critical conservation projects for endangered birds and their scarce and shrinking habitats in Europe,  Asia, South Asia, Africa, and North America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, cranes play an important role in cultures around the world. These birds are viewed as symbols of good fortune, happiness, and peace, and I ask Members on both sides to support passage of this noncontroversial bill that will help conserve this iconic family of large endangered birds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise too in support of <bill type="h" number="1771">H.R. 1771</bill>, the Crane Conservation Act. This bill is a worthy addition to existing multinational species conservation funds. They have demonstrated that even a small amount of taxpayers' money can make a real difference in saving flagship species from extinction around the globe, such as the highly endangered cranes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge an "aye" vote on <bill type="h" number="1771">H.R. 1771</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlelady from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin) such time as she may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairwoman Bordallo, for recognizing me today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the Crane Conservation Act of 2008, legislation to help protect and preserve the world's 15 species of cranes for generations to come. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds in the world, with 11 of the world's 15 crane species at risk of extinction. Their special characteristics and unique ability to bring people together across cities, States, and international boundaries places them in a class worthy of our conservation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cranes are revered throughout the world for their beauty, grace, and long-distance migrations, frequently spanning numerous countries. In fact, their appeal is so vast that they figure prominently in the culture, folklore, and art of many people around the world. They are featured in the silks, sculpture, poetry, and folk tales of many cultures. And, because of their long life spans, they have become symbols of longevity and good fortune.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These magnificent birds have served as ambassadors of harmony and peace in the international arena. Representatives from nations with various political struggles have reached beyond the instability to address the conservation of cranes. In fact, just about a year ago, representatives from bordering nations, including India, China, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and others, met in an attempt to overcome strained relations and send a message of goodwill for the sake of protecting this threatened  species. Similarly, African nations which share troubled borders have also joined together in recent years to stop the illegal trade of cranes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In North America, the whooping crane is the rarest of the crane species. Back in 1941, only 21 whooping cranes existed in the entire world. Today, there are almost 400 birds in existence. The resurgence is attributed to the birds' tenacity for survival and to the efforts of conservationists in the United States and Canada. In fact, since 2001, coordinated efforts have focused on encouraging young whooping cranes to migrate from their breeding grounds in Wisconsin's Necedah National Wildlife Refuge  to their winter destination in Florida. In an effort to reintroduce migratory flocks into their historic range in the eastern United States, the recovery team used ultralight aircraft to train and lead the young cranes on their spectacular journey stretching from city to city and State to State. Fortunately, these efforts have been successful, and the Crane Conservation Act would complement them, both domestically and internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will provide the resources to support initiatives to protect cranes and their habitats, which have deteriorated due to industrial development, pollution, and other human disturbances, including wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will also provide the means for the United States to fulfill various international obligations and commitments, thus having a large environmental and cultural impact across the globe. Additionally, the Crane Conservation Act will provide resources for the United States to bring people and governments around the world together to protect ecosystems, develop adequate habitats, and encourage overall goodwill. Specifically, the Crane Conservation Act will authorize up to $5 million per year  to be distributed in the form of conservation project grants to protect cranes and the wetlands and grassland ecosystems on which they depend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has passed similar bills in support of globally significant and endangered wildlife species, including tigers, rhinos, elephants, and neotropical migratory birds. And just as these efforts took significant steps in international wildlife conservation, the Crane Conservation Act would play a similar and promising role in improving endangered wildlife and their habitats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support the Crane Conservation Act.</paragraph>
