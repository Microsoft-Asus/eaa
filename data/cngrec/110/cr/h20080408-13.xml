    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are understandably trying to put a positive spin on the Iraq war. But the reality is that this has been the worst military fiasco in American history. But one of the questions I would like them to answer is how, when the Iraqi government has over $56 billion of revenue this year, they have the gall to ask the American taxpayer for another $170 billion?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have $40 billion in reserve that they have gotten from oil being over $100 a barrel. The American taxpayer is paying more than $3.30 a gallon for gas, and yet Iraq wants another $170 billion? They have got $10 billion in reconstruction funds. Yet we are going to continue to pay for all their needs? But that is what we are doing. We are paying for everything from military training, all the way down to garbage pickup, with American taxpayers' money, when they have got tens of billions of dollars  that they choose not to spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a disgrace, Madam Speaker. This policy has never been worthy of the sacrifice of our military families, let along their loved ones in uniform.</paragraph>
