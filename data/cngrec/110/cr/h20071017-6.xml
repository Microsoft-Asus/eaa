  <narrative>OVERRIDE PRESIDENTIAL VETO ON SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11641]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tomorrow, this House will consider and answer the question, the most essential question of our time, What kind of Nation are we and which direction shall we move? Shall we guarantee access to health care to our Nation's children, who need it most? Shall we send our children to the costly emergency room or to their family physicians' offices to receive the care they so desperately require?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whose side are you on? Failing to care for our Nation's children is morally unacceptable. This is the view of the March of Dimes; this is the view of Easter Seals, the faith communities throughout the country, and countless medical organizations across the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, I have the honor of representing the hopes and dreams and lives of 11 million children. Join us in overriding the Presidential veto. It's the right thing to do. And let's work together across the aisle to build a better future for all of us.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
