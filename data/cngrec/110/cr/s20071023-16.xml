  <narrative>KINGDOM GEMS OF VERMONT -- (Senate - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13256">S13256</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to stand before the Senate today to tell my friends about Vermont's Northeast Kingdom--a place that is known as much for its natural beauty as the rural and industrious Vermonters who have settled there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This region, defined by the three northeastern-most counties of Vermont that sit between the headwaters of the Connecticut River and the U.S.-Canadian border, became one of America's first National Geographic geotourism destinations. The designation highlights the character and sense of place that has come to define the dozens of mountain valley communities that sit in Orleans, Essex, and Caledonia Counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Marcelle was born in the Northeast Kingdom, just south of the Canadian border in the city of Newport. Since then, like many Vermonters, we have often found ourselves heading to this part of Vermont to visit friends, go for a hike, or find a special place to have a meal. The people of the Northeast Kingdom have made this region of Vermont advance while carefully holding on to the key elements of their identity. Whether they are crafting furniture from the forests of the north woods or  diversifying their family farm, these individuals have helped the communities of northeastern Vermont grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This autumn, Michelle Edelbaum and Daria Bishop of the Burlington Free Press published an article about a trip the two of them shared through the area, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of the article offering a glimpse into these "Kingdom Gems."</paragraph>

  <narrative>Kingdom Gems</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Michelle Edelbaum)</narrative>
  <narrative>When trees scream with crimson, gold and orange, head to the Northeast Kingdom for world-class leaf peeping.</narrative>
  <narrative>With foliage in mind, photographer Daria Bishop and I spent a day exploring the towns, shops and people that make the area special. We strayed from our loose plan to follow locals' hand-drawn maps down scenic dirt back roads to not-to-miss destinations.</narrative>
  <narrative>On our 13-hour tour we didn't reach half the locations on our list, which included classic attractions Cabot Creamery, Great Vermont Corn Maze, Stephen Huneck's Dog Mountain and Fairbanks Museum. But we did visit a handful of gems worth a stop.</narrative>
  <narrative>Twenty-eight years ago an enthusiastic David Smith and his wife, Willie, took over Highland Lodge in Greensboro from his parents and fostered a community-centric gathering place that hosts out-of-town guests and community gatherings. "The Walking Ladies," a group of 55 women who range in age from 40 to 86, meet thrice weekly in the dining room for coffee and muffins after they exercise.</narrative>
  <narrative>On their recommendation we ate moist, sugar-crusted blueberry muffins, from-scratch blueberry pancakes and a fluffy cheese and veggie omelet with McKenzie sausage links. After breakfast, we set out on the lodge's 30 miles of trails from a grove of soaring pine trees decorated with colorful placards of children's artwork, courtesy of the lodge's summer campers.</narrative>
  <narrative>In Greensboro village two stores dominate the retail scene. The Miller's Thumb, housed in a former grist mill, is filled with local artwork, fancy kitchen knickknacks, Italian pottery and antiques. Watch water rushing under the red building through a plexiglass-covered hole in the floor.</narrative>
  <narrative>At Willey's Country Store, customer Doug Aronson of Woodbury declares "if you can't find it here, you can't find it anyplace." Wine, appliances, groceries, hardware and clothes are sold at the town institution, housed in a rambling white building that dates to the 1800s and has been owned by the Hurst family for five generations.</narrative>
  <narrative>Look up as you approach Pete's Greens in Craftsbury. The roof of the farm's serve-yourself stand is laden with trailing plants, flowers and herbs. Peek inside at artful displays of colorful organic vegetables.</narrative>
  <narrative>Consider yourself lucky if you hit Stardust Bookstore and Cafe on the idyllic Craftsbury Common during its limited school-centric hours. The store, run primarily by students from Craftsbury Academy, sells new and used books, coffee and espresso drinks inside the quaint 1940s former public library. Part of the proceeds are given to nonprofit organizations and granted as scholarships.</narrative>
  <narrative>Just outside of town down a long dirt road lies Craftsbury Outdoor Center, on Great Hosmer Pond with 10 kilometers of trails open for biking and hiking. Ski director John Brodhead suggests spending an afternoon canoeing, mountain biking, walking with a naturalist, kayaking or relaxing in an Adirondack chair by the lake.</narrative>
  <narrative>Untold treasures lie within Red Sky Trading Co. in Glover. Owner Cheri Safford's whimsy is on display in the unique and colorful assortment of vintage house wares, Melmac resin dishware, trays, china tea cups, garden decor, picture frames and more, that fill the maroon barn.</narrative>
  <narrative>Buttery cookies, dense bars and rich chocolate cakes from Safford's kitchen share counter and refrigerator space with Vermont cheeses, natural sodas and local produce. Don't miss Safford's award-winning canned jellies, jams, bread and butter pickles, chutneys and pickled beets--just like Grandma made.</narrative>
  <narrative>Between a bank of beer coolers and a rack of chips at Currier's Quality Market Inc. stand three stuffed deer and a black bear; turn the corner into the postal area and you'll come face-to-face with a 948-pound moose. More than 100 taxidermy animals are on display in the one-stop shop, including a porcupine, wild boar, ram and British timberwolf.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jim Currier, who's owned the store for 40 years with his family, started the ever-growing collection 25 years ago with a deer head from his father. Hunters with a mount at the store earn "bragging rights," said Currier's daughter Julie McKay. Coming soon: a red fox, possum, and snow goose.</narrative>
  <narrative>By 4 p.m. we hadn't eaten lunch and regretfully skipped Bread and Puppet Museum and its "Cheap Art." We missed Mount Pisgah in Barton, with stunning views of Lake Willoughby, biking in Burke at Kingdom Trails, and a mandarin orange chicken salad at River Garden Cafe. We also passed on flat bread and microbrews at Trout River Brewing Co. in Lyndonville and coffee and chitchat at Miss Lyndonville Diner.</narrative>
  <narrative>Instead we split for St. Johnsbury, where local-food-centric Elements Food and Spirits, like many destinations in the Northeast Kingdom that have irregular hours, isn't open on Monday.</narrative>
  <narrative>At Kham's Thai, chef and manager Souki Luangrath, whose Essex Junction-based parents own the restaurant, says quality ingredients are a priority--he even deveins shrimp. Our refreshing late lunch included fresh spring rolls filled with crisp veggies, savory coconut Tom Kha soup and saucy panang curry with chunks of vegetables.</narrative>
  <narrative>Railroad Street in downtown St. Johnsbury is home to several dozen independently owned shops and restaurants. Moose River Lake and Lodge Store sells jewelry with a Southwestern flair, Adirondack and Amish-style furniture, fine wine kept in a walk-in vault, art by illustrator Philip R. Goodwin, quality sportswear and home decor.</narrative>
  <narrative>Scottie Raymond, formerly an employee at Outdoor Gear Exchange in Burlington, recently opened Kingdom Outdoors, which sells technical outdoor wear and gear. Raymond inked the graffiti-style mural in the skate shop and lounge downstairs.</narrative>
  <narrative>During the day, hit Dylan's Caf for creative breakfast and lunch combinations, the newly opened Village Baker for artisan bread and pastries, or Boxcar and Caboose for coffee drinks and books. If you have time, check out PODO Shoes, the Northeast Kingdom Artisan Guild and Gallery and Frogs and Lily Pads.</narrative>
