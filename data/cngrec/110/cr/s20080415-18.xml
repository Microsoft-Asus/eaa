    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to congratulate Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team on their Division I National Championship and to offer a Senate resolution with my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, to recognize the team's extraordinary accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past Saturday, in Denver, Boston College defeated the University of Notre Dame four goals to one to claim their third national championship and their second since 2001. For the Eagles and their legion of supporters, known as the "Super Fans," this victory marks the culmination of years of hard work in which they reached the Frozen Four's championship game in 3 consecutive years. Junior Nathan Gerbe was named the Frozen Four's Most Outstanding Player.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Led by head coach Jerry York, Nathan Gerbe, captain Mike Brennan, and assistant captains Matt Greene and Dan Bertram, the Eagles compiled an impressive overall record of 24 wins, 11 losses, and 8 ties during the 2007 to 2008 season, which also included Boston College's 14th victory in the historic Beanpot Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With their work ethic and dedication, the Eagles have made the entire Boston College community and all of us in New England proud. We congratulate the entire team, its coaches, and fans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also thank Father William P. Leahy, president of Boston College, who has proved that you can foster a collegiate environment in which both academic and athletic excellence are the order of the day. The team deserves great credit for its extraordinary achievement, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to approve this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Boston Globe be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>At BC, a Moment To Savor</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Nancy Marrapese-Burrell)</narrative>
  <narrative>DENVER.--When Boston College won its NCAA championship in 2001, Bobby Allen was one of the team captains. So it seemed fitting that it was Allen who gave the 2007-08 Eagles a crucial pep talk last week just prior to their departure for the Mile High City and this year's Frozen Four.</narrative>
  <narrative>In essence, Allen told the players to live in the moment, to revel in the joy of the event and remember that hockey is a labor of love.</narrative>
  <narrative>The team took that message to heart. After beating Notre Dame, 4-1, in the title game Saturday night at the Pepsi Center, the seniors in particular felt the weight of the world lifted off their shoulders. They were the ones who most acutely realized it was their last chance after two consecutive failed attempts at the crown. Senior center Dan Bertram said they were determined it wasn't going to elude them a third time.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I think [the experience factor] helped us a lot," said Bertram. "I know with our senior class here, we were all pretty tight. We didn't know exactly what the feeling was like to be on the other side and we sure as heck didn't want to have that this year. Everyone else really saw the passion from our captain [Mike Brennan] all the way down and you can't say enough about just this feeling and the achievement."</narrative>
  <narrative>When Allen and his teammates were celebrating their victory, John Muse was only 12 years old. The Falmouth native, who backstopped the Eagles in all 44 games this season, allowed only two goals in the Frozen Four, one each to North Dakota and Notre Dame.</narrative>
  <narrative>"He's been unbelievable," said Bertram. "I think everyone is going to know who John Muse is now. We're so proud of him and we had so much confidence in him. That's a hard thing, to come in as a freshman, and the whole year he has played solid, consistent hockey. The way he played in the Frozen Four is unbelievable. These guys are lucky to have him for another three years."</narrative>
  <narrative>While Muse was keeping out goals in his end, neither the Fighting Sioux nor the Fighting Irish could do a thing about junior left wing Nathan Gerbe, who tallied 4 points in each game (five goals, three assists) on the way to being named the tournament's most outstanding player. It's as if Gerbe was playing on an entirely different stage than anyone else. All they could do was watch.</narrative>
  <narrative>"In our eyes, he's the best player in the country," said Bertram. "To show up in the biggest games, I think that's the best [praise] someone can give you. He's a big-game player. To lead this team and score those big goals, he's going to be a great player at the national level, too, but it's just so nice to experience and play with him here and just see that talent first-hand. He's a game-breaker and if you give him some chances and loosen up a little bit, he's going to make you pay. The last  two games, he was unbelievable."</narrative>
  <narrative>The seniors provided strong leadership throughout the season, which was not always very smooth. There were winless streaks, injuries, and player dismissals. But the steady upperclassmen helped right the ship for the stretch run and none allowed themselves to get too excited until practically the final seconds ticked off the clock.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I wasn't exhaling until I looked up with six seconds left and said, `All right, I don't think they can score three goals with six seconds left,' " said Bertram. "It's almost surreal when you're sitting there and kind of watching the clock go down, 30 seconds at a time. I guess when it got to 1:30 [left] and I'm thinking, `This is really in out of reach now.' Six seconds was the only time I was like, `OK, start enjoying it a little bit.' "</narrative>
  <narrative>Senior Matt Greene said in his 22 years of living, the feeling of accomplishment is unmatched.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I can't say this is the best feeling I'll ever feel, but this certainly is the highlight of my life so far," he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Greene acknowledged, however, it hadn't quite hit him that although the seniors went out on the ultimate high, his collegiate career is over.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I've got a couple more weeks to stick around the BC campus," said Greene. "It's the last time I'll stare across and give [Andrew] Orpik a wink or maybe throw a tape ball at [Brian Gibbons] or maybe a little bit of ice at [Kyle Kucharski]. That's all a part of being a team.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Hockey is a special sport because you grow in relationships more than I think in any other sport. We deeply mean what we say and it's going to hit me for sure."</narrative>
  <narrative>Bertram said as devastated as they were to lose in the two title games prior to this one, that's how incredible the feeling is to win.</narrative>
  <narrative>"You never want to lose," said Bertram. "It's nice as senior, you're remembered for your last game. There is no better feeling than leaving Boston College, which has been so good to us, on top and winning. It's something I'll never forget and it's something forever I will be proud of."</narrative>
  <narrative>The Eagles will hold an autograph session at Conte Forum at 5:30 this afternoon, followed by a victory celebration at 6:15 p.m.</narrative>
