    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to recognize three great students from New Mexico today. These three students have harnessed their creativity and skills to produce amazing projects which were displayed today at the National Portrait Gallery in honor of National History Day. What a great achievement for these students to be selected out of 500,000 entries to be showcased in the National Portrait Gallery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shannon Burns, from Los Alamos Middle school, has put together a 10-minute documentary on Irish immigration and how it contributed to the American Civil War while Ryan Andrews-Armijo and Ashley Page from Moriarity Middle School contributed a documentary on the racial tensions and the triumph over those obstacles, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team. I was incredibly honored to meet with these three individuals earlier today, and I am impressed by their projects and their tenacity.  I am proud to see these kids learn and put into action what they have learned at school and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also very pleased to hear of 44 other students, in total, from New Mexico participating in the National History Day contest in Maryland today. It is quite impressive to see how well New Mexico was represented in this nationwide contest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National History Day is an academic organization for elementary and secondary children that has been celebrating history for over 25 years now. This exceptional scholarship program gives kids the opportunity to research a historical event and put that research into a format for others to enjoy. This is a great way for our children to learn and explore history while also putting their creativity to work. History is one of the cornerstone subjects taught in America's schools today. When students  learn about the past, they are taught how to handle the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National History Day gives us a unique opportunity to reflect on our past and appreciate where we, as Americans, come from. History makes us who we are, it defines us. We must not forget our history. Learning history is as important today in our schools as it ever was. We must always be stewards of continual learning from our mistakes and victories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations again to the amazing students participating in this great commemoration of history.</paragraph>
