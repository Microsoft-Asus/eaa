    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the brave men and women of our Armed Forces, our local first responders, and our intelligence community for the incredible work they do to protect our Nation and stop the enemy overseas so we will not face them again here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the upcoming anniversary of September 11th, we must take this moment to reflect on the terrible tragedy that occurred 6 years ago, causing our response to this global war on terrorism. We must maintain our resolve against bin Laden who has declared this struggle the "third world war" with Iraq and Afghanistan as the central front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Independent Senator Joe Lieberman wrote in today's Wall Street Journal: "In Iraq we are fighting and defeating the same terrorist network that attacked us on 9/11."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will succeed by remaining dedicated to promoting the safety of American families by denying extremists safe havens. And we are grateful to our servicemembers, professionally led by David Petraeus, who works day and night to defend our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
