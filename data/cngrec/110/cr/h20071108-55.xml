  <narrative>ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13390]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, everybody in America, at least the vast majority of Americans, are very concerned about illegal immigration. And they want it stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in the early 1980s, we passed a bill called the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. It was in about 1986, and it was supposed to stop illegal immigration. And what it ended up being was a magnet for more illegal immigration. It just simply didn't work. So today, instead of 2 or 3 million illegals in this country, we have got maybe 14, 15, 16 million. And we really need to deal with the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the problems we have is that we are not enforcing our laws. Here in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, a person can acquire an illegal driver's license, a fake, a fake Social Security card, a fake green card, and all they have to do is talk to somebody on the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My chief of staff lives over near a place here in Washington, D.C. called Adams Morgan. It's a very popular place, especially for young people. And the ABC News affiliate here in Washington, D.C., recently went down there with a camera and did an interview and watched what was going on as far as giving phony IDs to illegal aliens. And I want to read to you what happened. Here's what they said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"On any given day, you see them walking up and down Columbia Road in Adams Morgan. As soon as you make eye contact with them, they try to offer you freedom as best they can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Seller: `Green card or security card?'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Buyer: `Yes. What will that cost me?'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Seller: `The green card and Social Security card will cost you $140. The driver's license alone will cost you $120.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, they are selling fake IDs. And the people that attacked us on 9/11 had phony driver's licenses and had regular driver's licenses and they used them as ID to get on planes. And here in Washington, D.C., we have these people making phony ID cards, driver's licenses, green cards, Social Security cards, and they're selling them in broad daylight and we are not doing  anything about it. And these people may very well be terrorists and a threat to the  United States of America. I'll go on:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"After jotting down a fake name, using our subject's photo ..... the card sharks put it all together in a private office. Two hundred dollars and a couple of hours later, our subject picks up his documents ..... documents so real looking it's almost impossible to detect anything suspicious ..... identical seals, a new Social Security number, and even affirmation that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has given its okay. It's easy to get a good fake ID that can legitimately fool employers.  And the Federal employment verification "Basic Pilot" cannot detect fraud, which means employers must fend for themselves when determining if a prospective employee is authorized to work in the U.S. What's the point of a system if it doesn't work?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's my question tonight. What are we going to do? We have a system that invites illegal aliens to come into this country. They get education, they get health care, and we have even had legislation passed that would give them an apartment or a home to live in. It's just amazing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now we are not enforcing the laws that would stop these people from selling fake IDs, which could give a terrorist the ability to move about in a very easy way here in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is tragic. Our FBI, our Homeland Security, the State police and the local police in this country need to enforce the laws against creating these fake IDs. It is absolutely essential to keep this country protected and to stop the flow of illegal aliens coming into this country. What's to stop them? Nothing. Right now they get fake ID and they can go anywhere they want, and the American people are sick and tired of it. You talk to any congressman and go to any congressman's district and they  will tell you that the American people want this illegal immigration stopped. And we are not even enforcing the law and stopping the manufacture of fake IDs. We have to do something about it.</paragraph>
