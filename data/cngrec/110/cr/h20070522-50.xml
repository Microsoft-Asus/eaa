  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I was a child and I misbehaved, my mother would give me a stare that could curdle milk. Believe me, when I saw that stare, I knew how angry she was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, after reading the Senate amnesty giveaway plan, I now know how to give that same look, and so do my constituents. Rather than doing what the American people want, securing our borders, the Senate has thrown open the barn doors and given away the farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation already faces huge deficits in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Now the Senate and President Bush want to give away to anywhere from 12 to 20 million illegal immigrants the possibility to get welfare benefits, Social Security and Medicare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents back home in Florida work hard each and every day to pay their taxes and to keep America strong. In contrast, the Senate amnesty plan rewards illegal behavior and gives away our constituents' hard-earned Social Security and Medicare dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen up, America. The Senate amnesty plan is a tax amnesty bill. This is bad legislation.</paragraph>
