    <paragraph>Madam President, tonight the students who belong to the Future Farmers of America chapter at Centerpoint High School located between Amity and Glenwood, AR, are having their annual banquet. Some of these students will graduate next week and begin new chapters in their lives. While every teacher there has contributed to the education of each student I rise to today to honor one teacher there, Troy W. Buck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Troy Buck is a native of Alpine, which is located in Clark County in the southwest part of my State. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in agriculture at the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville and has spent 47 years in vocational agriculture impacting the lives of countless students along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Troy Buck taught for 21 years at Hope High School and built the Hope FFA chapter into the largest in the State. He then moved to Amity, which merged with Glenwood in 1995 to create the Centerpoint School District. Today under Troy Buck's leadership, Centerpoint's FFA chapter has almost 300 students, making it one of the State's largest. It operates the only school-supported meats lab in the State and recently 98 acres was purchased for a school farm. In addition to his educational activities,  Troy also farms 400 acres, most of which is in pasture or hay. He runs 100 head of cattle, operates 2 breeder hen houses, and produces Bermuda hay sold primarily to the racehorse market in nearby Hot Springs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Troy Buck is also a volunteer in his community. The Rockefeller Foundation has recognized him as a leader in small communities. He helped establish and build a building to house an ambulance service in Amity. Troy has  also helped establish volunteer fire departments and a community water system. He serves as president of Alpine Water Association and the Alpine Fire Department. He is a member of the Farm Credit Board, and serves on the State board of  Arkansas Farm Bureau. Additionally, he is a certified first responder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Arkansas is fortunate to have men and women of Troy Buck's caliber who devote their lives to providing excellent education for our children and improving the quality of life in our communities. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Troy Buck for his commitment and service to the State of Arkansas.</paragraph>
