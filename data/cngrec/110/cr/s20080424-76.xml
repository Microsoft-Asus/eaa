  <narrative>FAA REAUTHORIZATION -- (Senate - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3412">S3412</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had the opportunity to meet this afternoon with unions representing different airline entities. I also met with the owners and operators of airlines. We have a real problem on our hands. Fuel costs are now approaching 50 percent of the costs of our commercial airlines--50 percent. It used to be that the No. 1 cost, of course, was labor, personnel, but that is not the way it is. It is approaching 50 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are spending billions and billions of dollars, and most of that money is going to places we would rather it not go, to countries that have certainly nondemocratic forms of government, and a number of them are doing some very bad things with the money we are sending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to approach this FAA reauthorization to try to direct attention to some of the issues we read about every day: 3,000 flights being canceled, airlines flying with improper equipment. We are going to do our very best to have a good debate. I hope we can proceed to this legislation. It is something that is so important for us to do as a country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President,the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the FAA reauthorization bill--I will again remind everyone--will be at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.</paragraph>
