  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to pay special tribute to an extraordinary man, a loving husband, father  and grandfather; a valiant soldier; and a true patriot in every sense of the word--BG Darrell S. Cramer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darrell recently passed away, leaving a tremendous void in the lives of all who knew him. Yet his legacy of service, courage, and dedication will serve as an example for many generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darrell was born in Ogden, UT, to Olvie and Loretta Stuart Cramer and was the oldest in a family of five. He enjoyed his childhood immensely and excelled in athletics and academics. As a young child he developed a strong interest in aviation which would guide his future life. His dream of flying became a reality shortly after enrolling in a civilian pilot training course at Weber College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 7, 1941, Darrell was listening to the radio at home when he heard the news bulletin that stunned the Nation--Pearl Harbor had been attacked, and the United States was now joining the war. The very next day, he drove to Salt Lake City and visited the recruiting offices of both the Army and the Navy to try to enlist in the Aviation Cadet programs. At that time a recruit was to be at least 20 years old and have 2 years of college, so he was turned away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just over a month later the rules were changed, and Darrell, eager to serve his country, immediately enlisted in the Army. He quickly became an excellent fighter pilot candidate and excelled in the training. Thus began a storied and exemplary military career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The highlights of his military service included many tours of duty beginning in November 1942, when Darrell was sent to the South Pacific area as a P-38 pilot assigned to the 339th Fighter Squadron of the 13th Air Force. The young airman flew in the campaigns of Guadalcanal, New Guinea, and North Solomons and completed his tour of duty with credit for the destruction of a Japanese Zero fighter and Betty bomber aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December 1943, he returned to the United States and was assigned to a P-47 combat training school in Abilene, TX. In June 1944, General Cramer was assigned to the European Theater of Operations and flew a P-51 aircraft with the 55th Fighter Group. He finished this tour of duty as a squadron commander with a total of 300 flying hours in 60 missions and credited for the destruction of 11 German aircraft. As such, he joined an exclusive fraternity of fighter ace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of World War II, Darrell returned home, and shortly after, he left active duty to go into business with his father forming the Cramer and Son Coal Company. He went on to pursue additional business opportunities but couldn't put his love of flying behind him and once again joined the Utah Air National Guard. When the Berlin Airlift began in 1948, he was again called to active duty for Operation Vittles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When that operation ended, Darrell once again returned to the United States and began service as director of flying in the Advanced Flying School at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona. This was followed 2 years later with his return to Europe to assume command of the 53rd Fighter Squadron and later the 36th Fighter Bomber Wing in Germany.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This service was followed by assignments in Washington, DC, California, Turkey, Thailand, and Vietnam. In February 1971, General Cramer became the vice commander of the 17th Air Force, Ramstein Air Base in Germany. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1970 and retired from military service in June 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his many years of military service, Darrell was recognized and awarded many times for his courage and exemplary service to our Nation. His military awards and decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with an oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with an oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with 21 oak leaf clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Presidential Unit Citation emblem with two oak leaf clusters, and an Air Force Outstanding  Unit Award Ribbon with an oak leaf cluster. In addition, he was also inducted into the Utah Aviation Hall of Fame and the Order of the Daedalians, a fraternity of pilots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all of these accomplishments, Darrell became a larger-than-life figure to all those who knew him. Yet his humble and unassuming spirit was demonstrated in all he did. His greatest accomplishments he always maintained was marrying the love of his life, Mildred "Mick" McPhie. They built a beautiful life together providing a loving, cherished home for friends, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his later years, Darrell didn't just quietly sit and watch the days go idly by. He found happiness pursuing many hobbies and interests including golfing, skiing, and spending quality time with his brothers and sisters, grandchildren, and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also appreciated computer technology and used it to modernize his work in genealogy and family history. He spent many hours serving in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Family History Program. He shared his knowledge and helped many search for their own ancestors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the wonderful, strong military leader General George S. Patton once said, "It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I don't believe it is foolish for many to mourn the loss of this great man, I do believe that many do thank our Heavenly Father that BG Darrell S. Cramer lived and that he provided such a powerful example of courage, service, and love for generations to follow.</paragraph>
