  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. From June 29-July 4, the residents of Bowman will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bowman is a quaint town of about 1,500 people nestled in the southwest corner of North Dakota. It was founded in 1907 and is named after William Bowman, the territorial legislator, after whom the county is also named.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Bowman is the county seat of Bowman County. It is also home to the Pioneer Trails Regional Museum, which preserves the rich history of the community and surrounding area. Bowman lies in an area of the state that has a number of fossils that are millions of years old. In fact, within the last few years, paleontologists uncovered the fossils of a tyrannosaurus rex. Bowman also plays host to the Bowman County Fair, an annual day fair with live music, games, and other events that adults and  children can enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who call Bowman home, it is a comfortable place to live, work, and play. The people of Bowman are enthusiastic about their community and the quality of life it offers. Bowman won the City of the Year 2006 award from the North Dakota League of Cities. The community has a wonderful centennial weekend planned that includes school reunions, a golf tournament, local musical entertainment, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Bowman, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the next century. By honoring Bowman and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Bowman that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bowman has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
