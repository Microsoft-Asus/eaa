    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is the 100th anniversary of independence for the people of the Republic of Bulgaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 22, 1908, Bulgaria emerged from the control of the Ottoman Empire as an independent nation. Following World War II, Bulgaria was subject to totalitarian rule for much of the 20th century until the defeat of communism in the beginning of the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Bulgaria is a dynamic member of NATO and the European Union. I am grateful for the growing partnership between the United States and Bulgaria, in particular their courageous military contributions in the global war on terrorism. Last month, I was grateful to visit our extraordinary friends during a visit to joint Bulgaria-U.S. training bases in Bulgaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the co-chair of the Bulgarian Caucus, I have seen firsthand for the people of Bulgaria this remarkable achievement of freedom and democracy. The friendship between Bulgaria and America has never been stronger. Much credit is due to the professionalism of the departing ambassador, Ambassador Elena Poptodorova.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
