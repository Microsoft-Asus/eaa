  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last November the American people demanded dramatic changes and provided a substantial Democratic majority. Since the election, President Bush has yet to show he got the message.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While an overwhelming majority of Americans are demanding that the Iraqi Government take more control, the President has, instead, proposed an escalation plan that flies in the face of military experts, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, Democrat and Republican leaders in Congress and the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the President continues his failure to listen when it comes to Iraq, I hope tonight he will actually propose some helpful solutions to some of the most pressing concerns of hardworking middle-class Americans like those I represent in the State of Missouri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Democratic House has already produced positive results for the American people, passing our promised 100-hour agenda. I hope the President embraces these policies tonight and shows the American people that he has heard their discontent and plans to work with the Democratic Congress that the American people chose to take us in a new direction.</paragraph>
