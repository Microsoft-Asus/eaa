    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to highlight one of the most important pieces of legislation yet to pass this Congress: the Veterans Affairs-Military Construction appropriations bill. Each year from 1995 to 2006 the Republican-led Congress passed record increase  after increase for our Nation's veterans. More importantly, the Republican-led Congress made it a priority to pass the VA appropriations bill so that our  veterans could continue to receive the care that they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That, Madam Speaker, cannot be said of this year's VA funding bill. Reports in today's Congressional Quarterly are that the majority is considering holding the vital VA bill hostage as a means of passing a giant omnibus bill to fund government operations. The health and welfare of our veterans is more important to my constituents than it is to score cheap political points here in Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I hope that you can find it in your heart to appoint conferees to the VA-Military Construction appropriations bill and send the President a bill that he can sign. Our veterans deserve nothing less.</paragraph>
