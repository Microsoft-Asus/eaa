    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for far too long our country has suffered from the effects of this administration's lack of an energy plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This New Direction Congress has worked hard to set new standards for energy efficiency and independence. We enacted into law the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years. These standards will actually save the average family $1,000 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We created a diverse portfolio of alternative fuel standards that, when combined with traditional energy sources, puts us on the right track to becoming less dependent on foreign oil. And we helped lower prices at the pump by pressuring the administration to suspend the deposit into the government reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With these efforts we have made important steps. Much more needs to be done. We must come up with a more responsible energy policy that will provide relief for working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the solution to this problem requires Congress to focus on the Nation's efforts of encouraging innovation, while still using the abundant resources we have, like coal. I look forward to working on a comprehensive energy program this week and to make real progress for our Nation.</paragraph>
