  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5741">S5741</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this has been a difficult week. We have spent a lot of time in quorum calls. There has been a tremendous number of speeches. All have been good. I have enjoyed every one of them. But we have been working very hard to move to something on which we can work together. The housing bill has been brought to us by two of our most experienced legislators--Senators Dodd and Shelby. They both served in the House of Representatives. They are experienced. They  understand how Capitol Hill works. Senator McConnell and I have met with them, and we are now at a point, after a long discussion with them--they have had conversations with the administration; I have not had any, but they have--where Members should be advised that tomorrow morning at 9:30, as soon as the admiral completes his prayer and Senator McConnell and I have anything to say, we are going to move</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I advise everyone, the break before the Fourth of July starts a week from the day after tomorrow. In that short week, we have 4 days. We have to make sure we complete this housing bill. We will have to take a run at seeing if FISA can be completed. Either the House is going to send us a bill or we have a message here from them and we will work on that. We also have the little piece of legislation, the supplemental appropriations bill. The House is going to have a rule on that tomorrow. We have  permission, as I understand it, from the Republican leadership in the House that they can do a same-day rule. That matter will come to us sometime tomorrow night or Friday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot to do. We all want to go home for the Fourth of July, and we all need to go home. We have parades and constituents to see. It is an important time. We spend a lot of time here, and it is important we get back to the States during the week rather than only on weekends. I think the Republican leader and I have an agreement on how we will proceed on the housing bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader. We are going to have an opportunity tomorrow to legislate like the Senate has long been accustomed to legislating. We are actually going to offer amendments. They are going to be related to the bill, and we are going to get started. The majority leader and I and Senator Dodd and Shelby all agree on how we ought to go forward. I hope Members on both sides who have amendments that are related  to the subject matter will get them out early. Let's process them. Let's have the votes, and let's let the Senate work its will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have the other items the majority leader has indicated we need to address before the recess. We will work  diligently to get passage on all those matters. There will be a lot of cooperation on this side of the aisle, and I am confident there will be on the other side of the aisle so we can have a productive workweek before the Fourth of July break.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If I could say one or two additional things, I received a letter from, I think, nine Republican Senators and their request was totally valid. They said this is a big piece of legislation. Don't rush into it. I advise all Senators who sent me that letter, the legislation has been available all day. I hope they and their staffs looked through it. If there are provisions in it they think should be changed, that is what tomorrow and the next day and Monday will be all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have a good attendance in the Chamber, during July, there are no Monday no-vote days. In July, we are going to work all the work period. We also have a weekend that we have scheduled that we are going to be in session, July 25 we are going to be in session. Everyone has a lot of notice now to not plan anything for that weekend. We have work we need to do. I will be in close touch with the Republican leader tomorrow and on Monday, before we start our last rush, but everyone will have  a good idea of what we are going to do in the next work period. Right now it is a little bit in flux, but we know there are things we have to complete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, of course, is the last vote for today. We will start tomorrow morning. Hopefully, we will have some votes.</paragraph>
