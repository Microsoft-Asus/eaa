    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I would like to mark the annual chile festival in Hatch, NM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 36 years on Labor Day weekend thousands of New Mexicans and people from around the country converge on Hatch for fun and good food. The Hatch chile festival is the  premiere celebration of this fiery food that is near and dear to the hearts of New Mexicans. Chile, both red and green, is one of the distinctive flavors that makes New Mexico such a wonderful place to live and visit. A good deal of that chile originates in Hatch and it has rightly  earned the title "chile capital of the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this year's chile festival will be a success. I am sure all involved will walk away satisfied and with full stomachs.</paragraph>
