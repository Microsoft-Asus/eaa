    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the community calls him an advocate for children. However, this reverend from Pickens, South Carolina, said he just never wanted to be an elder who sat around and criticized youth; therefore he got out and helped the children at risk in his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A community service leader who has touched lives and strengthened faith, Rev. Julius Scipio is a lifelong minister and a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Anderson, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rev. Scipio has also been a strong advocate for the African American communities in the upstate of South Carolina, specifically in Anderson, Oconee and Pickens Counties. He is said to have blessed the members of his congregation through his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, Rev. Scipio was awarded the national Jefferson Award for his dedication to young African American males by creating the Elephant Men of Pickens County. He created this faith-based organization to represent elephants in the wild that form a circle to surround and protect the young in trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Black History Month, I thank Rev. Scipio for dedicating himself as a public and faith-based servant to protect our at-risk youth.</paragraph>
