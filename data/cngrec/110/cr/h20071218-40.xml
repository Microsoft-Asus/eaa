    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy that the Congress is doing its part today to alleviate the pressure Americans all over the country are feeling due to the subprime mortgage crisis. It is estimated that before this housing slump is over, almost 2 million homeowners will lose their homes due to skyrocketing interest rates on their mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September of this year, the House passed the Mortgage Relief Debt Forgiveness Act of 2007 without controversy. The Members of the House agreed on a bipartisan basis that this relief is necessary to give homeowners peace of mind as they navigate the current difficulties in the housing market. The Senate amendment to this bill further demonstrates Congress's support for this relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans are getting hit by the double whammy of, one, losing their homes to foreclosure and, two, getting slapped with a tax bill when the debt on their home is discharged by the lender. In situations where a lender forgives outstanding debt, it is considered income and, thus, is taxable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that our Tax Code, above all, should promote fairness and equity. Under current law, if your House is under foreclosure and the bank discharges your debt, you receive a tax bill. I don't think that's fair or equitable. It doesn't seem right for individuals in this circumstance to face a tax bill when they really have no increase in their net worth. As I see it, their house went down in value, and the individuals couldn't meet their current requirements, resulting in foreclosure. The  resolution we consider today rectifies that disconnect so that if a person's principal residence lost value, that loss won't give rise to a tax liability. The provision would sunset in 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="3648">H.R. 3648</bill>, as amended, would provide a 3-year extension of the deduction for private mortgage insurance. The deduction makes it easier for homebuyers to avoid having to take out a risky high-interest second loan in order to make a down payment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill includes provisions to make it easier for taxpayers to form housing cooperation corporations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this whole House can join the Ways and Means Committee members in strong support of this resolution. <bill type="h" number="3648">H.R. 3648</bill> restores some fairness to the Tax Code by preventing the unexpected tax consequences of foreclosure from hurting homeowners already smarting from the loss of their homes. Passage today will direct this bill to the President's desk and clear the path for this important legislation to become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400241" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. I've heard concerns from many homeowners in my district about the serious situation in the mortgage market. These declining prices have led some families to sell their homes for less than they paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 31, President Bush spoke from the Rose Garden and called on Congress to address the crisis in the mortgage market. Included in the President's priorities was a bill that Congressman ROB ANDREWS and I introduced in April. Our legislation would relieve tax obligations on those who sell homes that have lost equity and had been forgiven a portion of outstanding mortgage debt. Our measure is the cornerstone of the larger bipartisan bill that we are considering here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law, only two categories of individuals pay taxes when selling their principal residence: those who have been able to realize a capital gain of more than $250,000, or $500,000 on a joint return, and those who lose the equity in their home and are forced to pay taxes if the lender forgives some portion of the mortgage debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfair to tax people on phantom income, particularly when they have suffered serious economic loss and have less ability to pay the tax. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act would relieve this tax burden. The Andrews-Lewis provision states that no tax will be collected when a lender forgives part of the mortgage on the sale or disposition of a principal residence. This proposal has earned the support of the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Realtors  and the United States Department of the Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Addressing this Tax Code inequity and other long-term issues in the housing market goes to the core of our national economic stability. Today, we advance a bill to the President that seeks to calm financial markets, aid local communities, and support one of our most basic American aspirations: homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague Congressman Andrews for his commitment to this issue. I also appreciate the time and effort of my chairman, Congressman Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery and their staffs for moving this important measure to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us is a good first step toward addressing the mortgage situation. But more importantly, this bill is an example of what happens when both parties work together to produce good policy that will benefit millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our Chair, Mr. Rangel, and our ranking member for the hard work that they've done on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you to my friend from Ohio for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bills that come up on suspension are often thought to be of less importance. That surely is not true here today. Tax equity has been a major principle in our efforts this year. And this legislation is an important aspect of that, a response to the subprime mortgage crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The data just released by Fannie Mae show that our State of Michigan leads the Nation in losses on bad mortgages. Other rankings have Michigan at second in the Nation in delinquencies and third in foreclosure inventory. Ohio is next in some respects, but many States, really, all States show immense numbers of people who are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And nothing would seem more unfair than when someone loses their home to a foreclosure, if the bank sells their house for less than they owe, the IRS says "pay taxes," and this remedies it. Also, as mentioned, this bill provides a 3-year extension of the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums, another vital part of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By leveling the playing field among mortgage products, we will make homeownership more affordable, especially at a time when so-called "piggy back" loans are becoming more expensive, and in some cases difficult, to obtain at any price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I close with this remark, "we pay for it." We pay for it. That's also been an important principle, tax equity, but not deepening the hole of fiscal irresponsibility. And this bill lives up to both, equity and fiscal responsibility, and we're proud to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my good friend from Texas, Sam Johnson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. I've said it before and I'm saying it again, the current problems with the mortgage and real estate markets are considerable, but they're not permanent. This bill finally gets it right and provides a 3-year window so that lenders can restructure and write down loans, allowing people to move on with their lives without being taxed on phantom income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have confidence in the American economy and in the fact that real estate markets will rebound. Our economy is sound. The Federal Reserve is  now addressing mortgage lending practices that were out of control. And it's appropriate to restructure loans without taxing phantom income from the forgiveness of these inappropriate loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also glad to see this bill does not impose a luxury tax on one in 20 American families who own a second home. That tax on second homes also would have been an economic disaster for communities that rely upon tourism and recreation as their development strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill before us is an appropriate response to a painful but temporary problem. We should all vote "yes" on this issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman, Mr. Rangel, for allowing me to manage this bill because he knows that in Ohio, the foreclosure epidemic has gone from bad to worse, with new cases growing by nearly 24 percent from 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another colleague of mine on this great committee, in my same class, I yield 2 minutes to Mr. Larson of Connecticut.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400233" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from Ohio. And I also join in commending and thanking Mr. Rangel and Mr. Neal for their efforts in making sure that this legislation came to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me further associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished gentlelady from Ohio. By the end of next year, 2 million foreclosures will occur in this country. That's 2 million people and families whose lives and finances will be uprooted, 2 million communities affected. That's why it was so important for this committee to act. We should not add to their burden. We have to make sure that we preserve the American Dream for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ways and Means Committee reacted swiftly and reasonably to this crisis and said what we could do was make it easier for those who get a raw deal or are having a hard time. We could start by not making them have to pay taxes on money they will never see. And that is the beauty of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also contained in this bill is a provision that helps firefighters and first responders. It wasn't lost on Mr. Rangel, or Mr. Neal either, that it wasn't the FBI or the CIA or the armed services who responded at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, or the fields of Pennsylvania. It was volunteer firefighters. But the IRS, in its wisdom, chooses to treat income that they receive from their county, their State or their communities in terms of rebates on property tax or other  equipment as ordinary income. That is flat-out wrong. And again, I commend the leadership for making sure that we address these issues.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400241" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have voted against this bill twice in the Chamber. I rise today in support of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will now, in the right way, provide relief to American families who, after losing their homes in the past, have gotten a bill from Uncle Sam, and it is wrong. At a time when people struggle to keep their homes and they may lose them or have to sell them at a loss, we shouldn't be kicking them when they are down. This bill will right that wrong, giving taxpayers temporary relief for at least 3 years, and will also allow taxpayers to continue to deduct the premiums that they pay for mortgage  insurance, which will help a number of people afford homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased that the Senate stripped from this bill something we sent out of the House twice, which was wrong. What we attempted to do was to increase the taxes on people who own second homes. Now, the original thought would be, that must be the wealthy. It's not; it's the middle class. In fact, 40 percent of all the home sales last year in America were to second homebuyers. And they're not the wealthy. The average income of those buyers was $82,000. So, we were punishing  middle-class families for scrimping on their first mortgage so they could save up for a vacation home or resort home or retirement home or maybe even an investment. That would have punished families. It would have hurt, I think, many communities whose future relies upon retirees in resort and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me point out, too, that I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Rangel on this, and I appreciate that he recognized this problem and moved on it. I appreciate the leadership of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Andrews, who have fought for this legislation for many years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Brady, we're happy you got a wake-up call. Maybe you could bring us a few other Members over here to our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize now my colleague and good friend from the committee, Mr. Blumenauer, for 2 minutes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are watching fiscal chickens come home to roost with this housing bubble that is slowly working its way through the system. As my good friend from Connecticut mentioned, we are looking at perhaps 2 million foreclosures looming. There is another 2 million figure to keep in mind, and that is the number of loans that are going to reset in the next 18 months. And many of these people were not particularly sophisticated. There are a number of folks that appear to have been lured into subprime loans  that actually would have qualified for conventional, fixed-rate mortgages. And this is a ripple effect that can have a very profound consequence for people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we see a 15-percent drop in housing values, which is projected by Goldman Sachs, we are talking about millions of families who can be in this situation of having phantom income. If it is a 20-percent drop, it is 3.7 million. And some people feel that 30 percent correction is not beyond question, and that would put almost 20 million American homeowners in this negative territory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important for us to make sure that people are not paying taxes on phantom income. Frankly, I am a little disappointed that the legislation that came back to us from the Senate is only 3 years because I fear that this is going to be a longer-term problem. And, frankly, I can't foresee any circumstance where this Congress would like to apply tax rates on phantom income when anybody is under water, getting a loan forgiveness. We have put careful provisions in this to make sure that it is not  unlimited, it is not for wild speculation, but for typical, average everyday homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we pass this bill, but I also hope that we look at a long-term adjustment so that no one who is in this unfortunate circumstance ends up making a tax payment on phantom income when they have lost their home.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I join with my colleague to say I hope that at some point we will be able to extend this so it has no sunsetting provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to thank my friend from Ohio for yielding. I would like to thank my friend, Mr. Lewis, for his hard work on this legislation throughout the process, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery), and obviously our chairman, Mr. Rangel, and other members of the Ways and Means Committee, Mrs. TUBBS JONES in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we started working on this project, it was a matter of simple fairness to Americans who sold a home under difficult circumstances. Now, unfortunately, the problem has grown into one of economic urgency because our economy is in trouble today in large part because of a drop in housing prices and housing values. And one of the reasons that we would have a glut on that market would be if people have to dump their properties on the market because they can't get a workout on the loans that they  have because it would raise their taxes to come to a different arrangement with their lender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the wisdom of the committee, we are fixing this law in such a  way that will encourage people to work out an arrangement with their mortgagee to work out a way they can pay their loans and stay in their homes. And if they stay in their home, we won't have that glut of supply in the housing market. If we don't have that glut of supply on the housing market, prices will stabilize and not drop, which will mean more Americans have more home equity,  more Americans have economic confidence, and our economy can rebound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank all those both on the Democratic and Republican side of the aisle for making this project a reality, in particular the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, for their hard work in making this a reality and urge a "yes" vote on this bill.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure at this time to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke). She is a freshman in Congress and has been a leader in working on a lot of issues, particularly this one; and I yield to her particularly because this bill expands some of the coverages for cooperative housing corporations which I am confident is an issue for the gentlelady from Brooklyn.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412221" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and give praise to the gentlewoman from Ohio for her management of this very important legislation and, of course, to our distinguished chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the dean of our New York delegation, for his leadership on this issue and bringing this issue to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3648">H.R. 3648</bill>, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, because Americans need relief. We need relief. And under this bill, the mortgage debt forgiven through foreclosure, sale, or loan restructuring would no longer count as taxable income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is extremely vital to many New Yorkers, since a subprime tsunami is now sweeping across this Nation and many experts confirm that this wave will continue well into the next year with no end in sight. As a result, foreclosures are increasing at an alarming rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we count the last days of 2007, many expect more than 14,000 foreclosures to be filed in New York City alone. Mr. Speaker, Congress must do all that it can to help Americans to keep their homes. So today I will cast an "aye" vote in support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, which helps struggling homeowners cope with the unanticipated penalty of foreclosure.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400241" topic="">
    <paragraph>In closing, I want to, again, thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery. JIM and the chairman have certainly done a good job in working together to bring about this piece of legislation. Also I would like to thank the majority and the minority staff for their hard work and effort on this. And, too, I would like to thank Kevin Modlin on my staff. He has worked hard to help move this legislation through the process. This is a good day for those  homeowners that are in much need of some help. And of course, Congressman Andrews, thank you so much for your hard work on this and putting it forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time and ask for a "yea" vote on this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, almost all of us dream of a day when we can have a place of our own. For most Americans, buying a home is the single best investment they will ever make. It is the first step to building wealth and can provide financial leverage for a family for a variety of things, including starting a business or funding an education. Therefore, we must put safeguards in place to ensure that people are able to keep their homes and not be thrown into further debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is one reason why I am pleased to rise in support of this piece of legislation that will allow taxpayers to exclude from their income debt that which was forgiven by a financial institution or lender. We cannot sit by as Congress and add insult to injury to our most vulnerable taxpayers. That is why I am so pleased to stand with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in support of this very strong legislation in support of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, <bill type="h" number="3648">H.R. 3648</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.</chair>
