  <narrative>MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007 -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14611">S14611</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early morning of November 4, 2007, in Austin, TX, a man was beaten by a group of college-aged men screaming antigay slurs. Tony Baker, 29, was riding his bike home when three men called to him from a sidewalk. He stopped to engage them since he hadn't understood what they were saying, and the men approached him. When it became apparent to him that the men were shouting antigay insults and that they were hostile, he began to ride off. But it was too late. The men were already upon him and  began punching and kicking him in the head, still allegedly shouting slurs. The beating reportedly lasted about a minute, and Baker ended up in the hospital with minor injuries. The police are investigating the incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
