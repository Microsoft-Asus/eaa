    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday's headlines stated that more people will die from MRSA infections than die from AIDS, but that's just the beginning of the story, for actually some 90,000 people will likely die this year from an infection they pick up in a hospital or receiving health care. Tragic news. We also hear about students in school who have died from MRSA infections. But the point is hospitals are taking actions to reduce its infection rates, and yet Congress  is not doing anything to help address this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do something about it by passing legislation I've introduced, <bill type="h" number="1174">H.R. 1174</bill>, the Healthy Hospitals Act. My legislation would require hospitals to report infection rates. After all, people can find out if their airline is on time; why not be able to find out if your hospital is infection free. Nineteen States currently require reporting, and several other States are considering legislation. Medicare earlier this summer began denying hospitals reimbursement for hospital-related infections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is long overdue that Congress act. Let's standardize hospital reporting practices and fight hospital-related infections. I ask my colleagues to please cosponsor the Healthy Hospitals Act.</paragraph>
