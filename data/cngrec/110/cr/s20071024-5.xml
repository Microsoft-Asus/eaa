    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to immediately return to executive session to continue the consideration of Judge Southwick to be nominated to one of our circuit courts. The debate time until 11 o'clock is equally divided and controlled. The 20 minutes prior to the 11 a.m. vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination will be for the two leaders who will be recognized to speak, with the majority leader controlling the final 10 minutes. That order is already in effect. The consent  agreement says if cloture is invoked the Senate would go to confirmation following that cloture vote. Following disposition of the nomination, there will be 20 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture.</paragraph>
