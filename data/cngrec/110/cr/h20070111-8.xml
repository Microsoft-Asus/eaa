    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Alice Paul, a woman who dedicated her life to equality, to give her a Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul was a remarkable person who made America more democratic by fighting for equal rights and creating opportunities for women to participate in politics. Thanks to Alice Paul, Nancy Pelosi was able to become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Even after her death, her influence continues to be significant on our society and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday marked the day that on January 10, 1918, the House of Representatives first voted to give women the right to vote by approving the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Alice Paul spearheaded the effort to pass the 19th amendment, granting all American women the right to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of Alice Paul's legacy, my daughters, Natalie and Jennifer, have the right to participate in the electoral process. My grandchildren and their children will forever have this right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul's contribution to America cannot be understated. Without her, women may not enjoy many of the rights they have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please cosponsor this important legislation.</paragraph>
