    <paragraph>As a Member of the Budget Committee, I am proud of the 2008 budget that we sent to conference committee this week. Our budget is a responsible one, and it is attentive to America's priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our budget honors our commitment to our service men and women. It provides funding that will enable our veterans' health system to meet increasing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, our budget recognizes the priorities of hard-working Americans. It provides tax relief to middle-income families by fixing the AMT, extending lower tax rates, and continuing the earned income and child tax credits. And it expands SCHIP to provide health coverage to 7 million children of middle-income families who are currently uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, our budget enhances our Nation's economic competitiveness. It makes key investments to ensure our future workforce has the education and skills needed to compete in the global economy. Our budget is fiscally disciplined. It ends the unsustainable "borrow-and-spend" policies of the last 6 years. And it balances the budget in 5 years, setting us on a course to pay down our debt while meeting our obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should all be proud of this budget. It is a new direction; it is the right direction for America.</paragraph>
