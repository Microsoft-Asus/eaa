    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today with pride to introduce legislation honoring Cal Ripken, Jr. on his induction into the Pro Baseball Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill would rename as Cal Ripken Way Interstate 395 in Baltimore, which runs into the city and ends near Oriole Park at Camden Yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Calvin Edwin Ripken, Jr. grew up in Aberdeen, Maryland. A baseball standout from an early age, he led his little league team to the Little League World Series and was a baseball star at Aberdeen High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a professional, Cal spent his entire career with his hometown team, the Baltimore Orioles. Drafted out of high school, he rose through the minor leagues, joining the Orioles full time in 1982 when he was named Rookie of the Year. He then won American League Most Valuable Player honors and led the Orioles to their third World Series Championship in 1983.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From May 30, 1982, until September 19, 1998, Cal never missed a game. He played in an incredible 2,632 consecutive games, passing Lou Gehrig's record of 2,131 on September 6, 1995, in front of family, friends and fans at Camden Yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His career redefined the shortstop position, setting multiple offensive and defensive records, and paving the way for a new generation of players.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cal's stellar career no doubt makes him worthy of induction into the Hall of Fame. In fact, he was elected to the Hall with the highest vote total ever, the highest vote percentage for any position player, and the third highest vote percentage in history. But the numbers don't even begin to explain what he means to our national pastime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Baseball fans, and especially parents, are too often disappointed when our American idols fail to live up to our American ideals. Too often, our sports stars are famous for all the wrong reasons, but time and again Cal Ripken,  Jr. has been a source of pride for baseball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cal was a spectacular player, but not a flashy one. He played fundamental baseball, always doing the little things and setting the example for how a professional should perfect his trade, and he showed up every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the heights of the World Series Championship in 1983 to the depths of the 21-game losing streak that began the 1988 season, Cal was there every day. After the cancellation of the 1994 World Series, many fans marked September 6, 1995, the night Ripken played in his 2,131st game, as the night that America came back to baseball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ripken's commitment to working hard and playing by the rules became known as "the Ripken way." He inspired the people of Baltimore every season with his quiet and unassuming dedication to his work. In fact, I believe that Cal has inspired Americans all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Ripken way" is in many ways synonymous with "the American way." When you ask people about American values, they often mention dependability, loyalty, humility, and old-fashioned hard work. Cal Ripken embodies these values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think Tony Kornheiser captured this well in a column that appeared in The Washington Post on September 7, 1995. He wrote, "When I look at this record, I think I hear the rhythms of America. This celebration of Cal is the fanfare for the common man. Going to work every day, come hell or high water, building a career, providing for a family like our fathers did before us is something we can all relate to. I think America looks at Cal Ripken playing every game, playing them in  the same small town where he grew up, putting his hand over his fluttering heart as the ovations pour over him like tidal waves and signing autographs afterward, and says to itself, here is a man I can respect, here is a man with values I admire. You don't often hear that about professional athletes anymore."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if we pass this legislation, when travelers come to visit Baltimore or pass by on their way to another destination, they will not only be reminded of a terrific ballplayer whose name has become synonymous with the Orioles, but also a model American and the promise of doing things "The Ripken Way."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues agree that this is a fitting tribute to one of the best loved and most enduring figures in the history of baseball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cal, congratulations on your induction into the Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
