    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our intelligence agencies have confirmed that al Qaeda is stronger in numbers and effectiveness than it has ever been. And that's because 5 years ago, when we had bin Laden cornered and crippled, we outsourced the job of capturing him. And then we diverted our focus and our resources to Iraq, which turned out to be his greatest dream realized because it gave him so many propaganda tools as a rallying cry and a recruiting tool. And that's just what happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now, when President Bush says that he envisions a military presence in Iraq similar to South Korea, well, we've been in South Korea for 50 years, this plays into their propaganda. We need to make clear there will be no permanent military bases in Iraq; that we are not there as occupiers, but rather as liberators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's start getting serious about winning this global war on terrorism. We can start today by passing the resolution declaring that the Congress is unequivocally opposed to permanent military bases in Iraq.</paragraph>
