  <narrative>REMEMBERING FRANK STROUD -- (Senate - July 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7569">S7569</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor a man we recently lost--a remarkable individual full of warmth and generous of spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Jackie and I came to know Frank Stroud as a doctor at the Spring Valley Pediatrics practice to which we take our daughters. But before Frank was one of our daughter's doctors, he was a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father said at the end of his life that he hadn't regretted a moment of his career in public life because no other calling gave him the opportunity to impact the lives of so many people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He might have said otherwise had he met Frank Stroud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frank had a remarkable capacity for remembering every detail about you. His ability to make casual acquaintances feel like old childhood friends would have made Members of the Senate green with envy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But public office wasn't his vocation. Nor was the seminary, which he contemplated entering. As his children say, Frank found a higher calling:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Helping children--which Frank did for nearly four decades, specializing in helping children struggling with learning disabilities such as attention-deficit disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But politics was certainly never far from his mind--or his work. His wife Kandy, whom he loved dearly, worked for the Democratic National Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Terry McAuliffe once said, Frank became "the pediatrician for the Democrats," having treated Al Gore's children and Smith Bagley's, among others. And 40 years ago this year, Frank became medical director at the Office of Economic Opportunity which was, of course, at the very center of President Johnson's War on Poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all have unique experiences in our lives that shape the person we become. In Frank's case, one of those experiences was that he was raised by a single mother. One of his children said in his eulogy of his father words that are so poignant today:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"At a big party, he would make sure to dance with all the single ladies as though he knew what it felt like for his mother to sit along the edges of the dance floor."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frank passed away a little over a month ago. At the time, he was doing what he always does: caring for someone other than himself--in this case, his beloved mother Lila, from whom his strength of character was surely handed down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so today, I wish to extend our thoughts and prayers to Kandy, their three children and the entire Stroud family, and quote the words in his obituary, which read:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, he was. Frank will be missed. His memory will remain, his legacy will endure, for as long as the children he cared for grow into the healthy adults Frank always believed they could. And because of Frank Stroud, they most certainly will.</paragraph>
