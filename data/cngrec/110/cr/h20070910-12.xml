    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment over the continued lack of progress in Iraq. The sobering content in both the GAO report and the Jones report should finally be a wake-up call that some Members in this House need in order to act to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The findings should make it clear to this tone-deaf Administration that our current path in Iraq is failing. The problem of sectarian violence in Iraq will not be solved by sacrificing more blood of young Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After losing more than 3,500 of our brave men and women and spending close to half a trillion dollars, it is time to bring our troops home. To continue to ask our service men and women to make the ultimate sacrifice for a misguided policy is simply immoral.</paragraph>
