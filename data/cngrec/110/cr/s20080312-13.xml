  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO GENE SEGERBLOM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to extend the best wishes of the United States Senate to Genevieve "Gene" Segerblom on the occasion of her 90th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born, raised and educated in Nevada, Gene is one of our State's most treasured citizens. She served the public as a nurturing teacher, a Boulder City councilwoman, and a State assemblywoman. Throughout her career, she has been a tireless leader in the fields of historic preservation, sustainable development, cultural affairs, and ethical government practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those familiar only with Gene's family tree might assume that a political career was her destiny. After all, she followed in the footsteps of her mother, Hazel Bell Wines, and her grandfather, William J. Bell, both of whom served in the State legislature. But anyone who knows Gene sees her not as a politician, but as a mother, wife and teacher who took her passion and wisdom into the realm of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few of the things I treasure are paintings I own, painted by Gene's husband Cliff. He was one of Nevada's all-time great painters. Cliff was also a judge of quality, serving the people of Boulder City and other places where he was called upon to render justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene's son Tick Segerblom is now serving with distinction as a Nevada State assemblyman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gene Segerblom has enriched countless lives, including mine. Landra and I are proud to call her a friend, and I wish her health, happiness, and joy as she celebrates this milestone birthday.</paragraph>
