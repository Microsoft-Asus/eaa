  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="JOHN WARNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Today is a day I have dreaded. Today I say farewell to my good friend and esteemed colleague, Senator John Warner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years ago, in an article for a Capitol Hill publication, Senator Warner called attention to the courage of America's war veterans. He explained that the men and women who serve in our military are "heroes [who] share the timeless virtues of patriotism and selfless devotion to duty in defending our country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Warner is one of my "heroes." He is a man who has always displayed "the timeless virtues of patriotism and selfless devotion to duty in defending our country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Senator Warner has spent his life in service to our country. He enlisted in the Navy at the tender age of 17 in order to serve in World War II. A few years later, he joined the Marines in order to serve in the Korean conflict. From 1969 to 1972, he served as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and from 1972 to 1974, as Secretary of the Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1978, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, and is now the second longest-serving Senator in the history of his beloved Commonwealth of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His entire Senate career has been marked by his dignity, style, grace, and integrity. He is one of those men with whom one can disagree without rancor. I cannot recall ever hearing anyone speak ill of John Warner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years ago, on another occasion in which I paid tribute to my good friend, I referred to him as "the classiest of class acts"--and he is. We  will miss his comity, his courtesy, and his refreshing bipartisan spirit always seeking consensus solutions for the good of the country. Whether in committee or on the Senate floor, he never succumbs to the bitter, destructive partisanship which has all too often characterized this chamber in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Warner has spoken out against his own party when he felt that the wrong course was being pursued. When the horrors of Abu Ghraib came to light, John Warner did not hesitate to help write the legislation to restrict the use of torture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Warner embodies the guiding principles set down by another of our country's brave warriors, GEN Douglas MacArthur, who proclaimed his leading lights to be, "Duty, honor, country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, without qualification, I can say that it has been an absolute pleasure to have served with this distinguished and esteemed Virginia gentleman, and I will miss him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I came to know Senator Hagel in 1997 when we worked together on the Byrd-Hagel Resolution related to the Kyoto Protocol. We made a good team because our effort was approved unanimously, by a vote of 95-0.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our work together, I made a new friend because I found Senator Hagel to be a likeable and cooperative person as well as a knowledgeable and hard-working Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My respect for this dynamic Senator increased as I watched him become one of the Senate's most outspoken critics of Mr. Bush's war in Iraq. Several of us were already pointing to the disastrous results of the Bush administration's flawed and failed Iraqi war policies. But Senator Hagel's opposition to the war carried very special impact. He is a conservative, a member of the President's own political party, and a military veteran. In fact, he still carries shrapnel in his chest and remnants  of burns to his face from his service as an infantryman in Vietnam. Senator Hagel now calls Mr. Bush's war in Iraq "an absolute replay of Vietnam."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss my friend and colleague. The Senate needs strong, independent voices like Senator Hagel--lawmakers who are willing to put the best interests of our country and American people over partisan politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when the Senate convenes next January, it is difficult to accept that Senator Domenici will not be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This son of an Italian immigrant grocer was elected to the Senate in 1972, making him the first Republican in nearly 40 years to be elected to the Senate from the great State of New Mexico. He is now the longest serving Senator in the history of New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate, he established himself as an expert on fiscal policies and the intricacies of the Federal budget. Having served with Senator Domenici on the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I have come to know and respect him not only as a dear friend and colleague, but also as a formidable opponent. Senator Domenici and I have clashed swords many times on the Senate floor, and, believe me, when you clashed with him, you would have the fight of your life. He has one of the  sharpest minds on Capitol Hill. He is one of the most knowledgeable people on the budget on Capitol Hill. And he is always prepared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh, how I regret that he will be leaving us all too soon. But I would like to use this opportunity to thank the senior Senator from New Mexico for his wonderful service and to congratulate him on an outstanding career in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Senator Domenici, for all your work for your State, and our country. And, thank you, Pete, for being a friend.</paragraph>
