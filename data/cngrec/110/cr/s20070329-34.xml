    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the memory of deputy sheriff Manuel Villegas, a dedicated public servant committed to protecting the safety of his community, the State of California, and the Nation. Just 17 months into his tenure with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, Deputy Villegas tragically lost his life in an automobile collision while en route to a domestic violence call on March 19, 2007. It is testament to the heroism and commitment to duty of this young deputy sheriff  that he died while trying to protect someone in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Lindsay, CA, Deputy Villegas served honorably in both the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army before joining the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. Deputy Villegas's exceptional work ethic and performance in the Army Airborne School earned him the parachutist rating and enabled him to join the selective ranks of the Army's paratroopers. For his service in the Army Special Forces Group, 307th Infantry Battalion and the Special Forces, 2nd Battalion, Deputy Villegas was awarded  numerous distinctions including the Bronze Star Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, and the National Defense Medal. He also earned campaign medals for his service in Afghanistan and Kuwait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deputy Villegas' decorated service in the U.S. Armed Forces was followed by an equally distinguished record at the Sheriff's Basic Academy. He proved to be an exemplary recruit upon entering the academy on November 14, 2005. He graduated first in his class and was awarded the California Academy Directors Association Award for serving as a model of excellence to fellow students and encouraging others to strive for success. Athletically talented, Deputy Villegas even set the Basic Academy's record  for the mile-and-a-half run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deputy Villegas is described by his colleagues as having been an exemplary deputy sheriff who was well respected and highly invested in making  a difference in the lives of others through his career in law enforcement. Deputy Villegas demonstrated a commitment to the highest standards of his profession and continually sought to distinguish his service to his community and country through hard work and perseverance. He serves as a shining example of the  talent, bravery, and richness of our Nation's law enforcement officials and military personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact of Deputy Villegas' loss will have an immeasurable impact on the lives of his loved ones. His wife Xochitl, four children, Stacie Lee, Ezequiel, Xavier and Israel, and his colleagues at the Riverside County Sheriff's Department have lost a beloved husband, devoted father, and cherished friend. I am saddened to lose this exceptional public servant, yet I am grateful for the heroic sacrifice that he made to protect his community.</paragraph>
