    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have another unanimous-consent request, and this is the one I tried to offer earlier. I ask unanimous consent that if the House further amends <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> with the text of <bill type="h" number="1401">H.R. 1401</bill> and requests a conference with the Senate, the Senate agree to the request and appoint the same conferees which the Senate has already appointed to <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, we have already agreed to the previous consent to go to conference on the 9/11 Commission legislation. We have named conferees on the part of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand it, the House wants to add a new bill to the conference, which includes provisions that were not included in either Chambers' 9/11 bill. I am not familiar with all the provisions of <bill type="h" number="1401">H.R. 1401</bill>, but I know the Senate has not acted on that bill, and we don't believe it was part of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, we need to object to this request at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
