    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Loyola Academy for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects their hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role they have played in giving back to their local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Loyola is a Jesuit High School in Wilmette, IL. They have a longstanding relationship with the Sicangu Tikanga Okiciyapi Habitat for Humanity. For 6 years, Loyola Academy has supported this affiliate, and this past year they provided three groups of volunteers. Loyola Academy's support has been instrumental in making progress in the area that is far reaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Loyola Academy and to congratulate them on receiving this well-earned award and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
