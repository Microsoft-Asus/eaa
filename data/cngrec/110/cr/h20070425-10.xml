    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there will be a conference committee report by the Senate and the House on the Iraq supplement, and the Iraq supplement will have a requested date, suggested date for our withdrawal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not saying we have been defeated. We have won the war. America has won the war. Saddam Hussein's government was toppled and Saddam Hussein is history. We are now in an occupation, and you cannot win an occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You cannot defeat beliefs with bullets. What we have in Iraq and in the Middle East are beliefs that are different from ours, and they can only be won by understanding and through changes, which God would put in people's hearts, and not through bullets. We need a bill to support our troops, and our bill will support our troops with more money than the administration gave it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the President to support the troops with the bill that the Congress will give him and support our troops and bring them home.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
