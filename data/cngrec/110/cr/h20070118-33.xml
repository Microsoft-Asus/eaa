  <speaking speaker="412188" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with the completion of the first 100 hours, I stand here today to discuss an issue of critical importance to southern Arizona, and that is our illegal immigration crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me point out two recent events. On January 12, a Border Patrol agent had a deadly altercation with an illegal immigrant crossing into our district. That investigation is going on at this moment. A couple of weeks ago, members of the National Guard unit assigned to work with the Border Patrol were threatened by an armed gang that came into our country and then left. That incident is being looked at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While many questions still surround these recent incidents, one thing is crystal clear: Now that our 100 hours are over, we must address the illegal immigration crisis and secure the border today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are putting our Border Patrol and the National Guard under tremendous strain. It is our responsibility to provide them with the necessary resources and the tools they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fighting for a comprehensive immigration plan must be a priority for this Congress, Democrats and Republicans working together.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
