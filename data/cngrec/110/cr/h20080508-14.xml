    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 6 days, on May 14, we observe the 60th anniversary of the declaration of the independence of the State of Israel. That's also the 60th anniversary, I'm proud to say, of the day that the administration of President Harry Truman recognized the State of Israel as a free and independent state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the past 60 years, the relationship between the United States and Israel has been based on a shared commitment to democratic values. Also, for the past 60 years Israel has  stood on the front lines in confronting those who would use terror against civilian populations as a means of bringing about political change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout that time, the United States has stood for the political independence and the physical security of the State of Israel. But we usually find ourselves as being in the rear echelons as standing behind Israel more than standing beside Israel. But not any more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ever since 9/11, we in the United States have come to realize that we're members of the same club, that we, too, stand on the front lines alongside Israel in an ongoing war on terror. We not only belong to the same philosophical society, we're also serving in the same outfit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we congratulate Israel on its 60th birthday, we look forward to the day when each of us will be able to devote less of our national treasures to the vital work of survival and national defense and be able, instead, to devote more of our national treasures to more profitable enterprises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of my fellow Georgians, I congratulate Israel on this milestone, and I pledge my best efforts to making the next 60 years of our relationship together years of peace and prosperity.</paragraph>
