    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this concurrent resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, this concurrent resolution makes technical and conforming changes to the Second Chance Act, <bill type="h" number="1593">H.R. 1593</bill>, to expedite its proper enrollment. The House passed the Second Chance Act in November on suspension by a vote of 347-62. May I note for the Record that this is the 10th year during three Congresses that this legislation has been worked on, debated, had witnesses, been voted on; and now we come here today to make some technical changes and, with  our holiday wishes, send this measure on its way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Second Chance Act strengthens overall crime-fighting efforts by helping give ex-offenders tools for staying out of trouble, support for job skills, stable living arrangements, substance abuse treatment, health services, and other very basic resources to successfully rejoin society and lead productive and law-abiding lives. It enjoys, clearly, wide bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This concurrent resolution expedites the process of finalizing the bill and sending it to the President in this session of Congress by making a few corrections brought to our attention after the bill passed the House last month, such as standardizing certain criteria in the process for three different kinds of grants and clarifying eligibility for a prison pilot program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a good measure. The corrections here are technical only. And I am proud to bring it to the attention of my colleagues for passage as urgently as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to start out by thanking Chairman Conyers, who has worked extraordinarily hard for a very long period of time, as he pointed out, on this bill; and also Mr. Danny Davis, who has been a real brick and worked very hard on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this concurrent resolution making corrections to <bill type="h" number="1593">H.R. 1593</bill>, the Second Chance Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 13, 2007, the House passed the Second Chance Act of 2007. This resolution makes technical changes in three sections of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the resolution modifies sections 111 and 112 to require that States pay no less than 50 percent of grant funds to establish reentry courts and the Prosecution Drug Treatment Alternative program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the resolution eliminates in section 231(g) the technical requirement that eligible elderly prisoners who qualify for early release also satisfy the existing law for the compassionate release program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend, a ranking member in the Judiciary Committee, for his important work on this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="270">H. Con. Res. 270</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
