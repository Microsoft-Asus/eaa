    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, following any time that may be used by the leaders, there will be 60 minutes of debate on the motion to invoke cloture on the Dorgan drug reimportation amendment, with the time divided between Senators Dorgan and the Republican leader or his designee. The vote then will occur around 10:30 or a few minutes after that this morning. Members who have second-degree amendments to the Dorgan amendment must file them by 10 this morning. A number of other amendments  are still pending, and today will be a busy day, with votes occurring throughout the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another issue which will need the Senate's attention will be the conference on the budget resolution. The House is going to act either today or Monday appointing conferees, which will mean we will act shortly thereafter. The chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, and the ranking member, Senator Gregg, have had initial conversations about the likelihood of there being motions to instruct the conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Budget Act, there is a maximum of 10 hours of debate to get to conference. I would hope the two managers of that budget resolution, Senators Conrad and Gregg, can make a determination as to how many motions to instruct there will be to give some idea. As I understand the rule, we have 10 hours of debate no matter what. If there are motions to instruct that have been filed and not enough time to debate them, the votes will take place with no debate. I hope there will  be adequate time to debate whatever motions to instruct and basic conversation about that most important budget resolution that we need to complete so we can get to the appropriations bills. I will be discussing this matter with the Republican leader and may have more to say during the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is a lull in the schedule today, we have a number of judges we can vote on. We may do that. Senators Kennedy and Enzi have done a masterful job in moving this matter along. We hope they will continue their masterful work and complete this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do say, as I have said, but it is worth repeating, Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, some would say, are not a matched pair. They have different political philosophies, they come from different parts of the country. But that is really what the Senate is all about. They have set an example of how individual Senators can work together. They are really exemplary, as far as I am concerned, in being able to move a very difficult, complicated piece of legislation by understanding  that this is not the last word. There is going to be a conference. Senator Kennedy has told Senator Enzi that he would be a part of that conference. They trust each other. That is important. We finished the competition bill last week. This is another step forward. I hope we can complete this bill today.</paragraph>
