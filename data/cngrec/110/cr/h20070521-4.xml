    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to help address domestic violence in our country, I rise to announce the re-introduction of the Security and Financial Empowerment Act, or as it is better known, the SAFE Act. Domestic violence is a personal and social tragedy that negatively impacts all of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On average, every day in our country, more than three women are murdered by their husband or boyfriend, and nearly one-third of American women report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The physical and psychological consequences of domestic violence are exacerbated by the less obvious economic consequences. For example, one of the key reasons survivors stay in or return to an abusive environment is because they are financially dependent upon their abuser to provide for them and their children. As a result of the abuse, employed women often lose their jobs due to frequent tardiness or absenteeism or because their abuser stalks and harasses them at work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help break this cycle of violence, I have introduced the SAFE Act with representative Ted Poe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SAFE Act would provide employed survivors of domestic violence with greater employment protections and increased economic stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the SAFE Act would enable the survivors of domestic violence to pursue legal assistance, medical care and meet other immediate needs associated with violence in their lives without the fear of losing their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If survivors of abuse are fired or forced to leave their job as a result of the abuse, the SAFE Act makes them eligible for unemployment benefits. The SAFE Act also helps employers address the negative impact of domestic violence in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it is true that domestic violence is a personal tragedy, it is also true that it has costly negative consequences to employers who pay an estimated $3-13 billion a year in sick leave, absenteeism and lost productivity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SAFE Act helps businesses save money by helping to reduce absenteeism and lost productivity and by enabling businesses to retain valuable and experienced employees, thereby avoiding the high cost associated with training new staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In summary, the SAFE Act empowers survivors of domestic violence. It protects the bottom line of business, and it improves the quality of life of our American society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the many advocacy groups for their support of the SAFE Act and for the work they do every day to end domestic and sexual violence in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I sincerely thank Representative Poe for his cosponsorship, and I look forward to working with him and my colleagues in Congress to pass the SAFE Act and empower women against the violence in their life.</paragraph>
