  <narrative>FURTHER CHANGES TO <bill type="sc" number="70">S. CON. RES. 70</bill> -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10720">S10720</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, pursuant to section 223 of <bill type="sc" number="70">S. Con. Res. 70</bill>, I previously filed adjustments to the 2009 budget resolution for <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>, the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. Those adjustments reflected the Congressional Budget Office's estimate at that time of the budgetary effects of <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CBO has since revised that estimate, increasing the amount of net savings over both 5 and 10 years. As such, <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill> still meets the conditions required for the release of the reserve fund under section 223, including being fully paid for over both the 6- and 11-year time periods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consequently, I am revising the adjustments made on September 29 pursuant to section 223 to reflect CBO's updated estimate. This adjustment affects both the budgetary aggregates  and the allocation provided to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="70">S. Con. Res. 70</bill>.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
