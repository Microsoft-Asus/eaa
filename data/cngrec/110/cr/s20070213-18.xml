    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great Kentuckian, Mr. Danny Orazine, for his 13-year service as county judge-executive to the people of McCracken County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Orazine is the epitome of a man dedicated to serving his county residents, all the while ensuring a strong relationship with the city government as well. He is a modest, ethical, and fairminded man who has given much to McCracken County, and I am proud of the work he has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, December 25, 2006, The Paducah Sun newspaper published an article highlighting Mr. Orazine's many years of service. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record and that the entire Senate join me in thanking this beloved Kentuckian.</paragraph>
