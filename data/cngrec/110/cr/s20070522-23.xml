    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Frankfort, SD. Founded in 1882, the town of Frankfort will celebrate its 125th anniversary this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Spink County, Frankfort was named after Frankfort I. Fisher, a settler who explored the area. It was also named in part after Frankfurt, Germany. Frankfort has been a successful and thriving community for the past 125 years and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and traditions for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Frankfort on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
