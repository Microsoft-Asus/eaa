  <speaking speaker="412193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 930, which will designate February 2008 as "Career and Technical Education Month" and recognize the important role career and technical education plays in the instruction of America's students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, over 15 million students participate in career and technical education programs. Career and technical education programs offer diverse courses in subject areas that support the development of a competitive economy, and the courses are constantly evolving to meet the needs of the global market. For example, the Cisco Networking Academy has focused on giving students across the Nation hands-on activities within its 18 programs to prepare students for career opportunities in telecommunications  and continuing their education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another such institution is Marshall Academy. This CTE program at this Fairfax, Virginia, high school strives to expose students to various career paths through a full line of technical and professional courses. Classes in business management, auto services, criminal justice, and culinary arts are bolstered through business partnerships with companies such as Microsoft, Sheridan Hotels, and Ford Motor Company. Career and technical programs like these are responsive to the business needs of the  community and set students on a successful path for the future. These programs can be found throughout communities across the country and are integral to ensuring America's place in the global economy through the integration of science, math, and literacy in technical course work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of CTE can be seen in the data that we have in students who participate in CTE courses. We know that students who take career and technical education courses are more likely to stay in school and, while there, obtain higher grade point averages than their peers. And we also know that when a course combines rigorous academic content with technical subject matter, students are encouraged to actively engage with their studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, career and technical education programs are an effective means of linking high schools with community colleges. These links introduce students to future learning opportunities and ease the transition to a post-secondary education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, programs such as these help foster a highly educated and skilled workforce through internships, job shadowing, and other cooperative work experiences. These courses provide a foundation of skills that prepare students for gainful employment in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies have shown that students who participate in career and technical education programs have better employment opportunities and earn more than their general education counterparts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am encouraged by the many gains students have made through career and technical education programs and believe that a skilled workforce is paramount when competing in a global economy. In my district, there are four CTE school programs and I think like all Members across the country, they are extremely impressive institutions with great committed faculty and students who are totally motivated and engaged in the special skills that they have the opportunity to get a head start in terms of their  future job growth and their job opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for Career and Technical Education Month, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 930, which supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical Education Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty-five years after the passage of the first piece of Federal vocational education legislation, career and technical education continues to evolve from its original and sole focus of preparing students for work immediately following high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the goal of career and technical education is to empower students to participate effectively in an international economy. Career and technical education programs contribute to broad educational achievements of students. These programs may include classes in basic skills, but also higher level skills, such as the ability to utilize technology, the ability to think creatively, solve problems, and the ability to work independently and as part of a team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Career and technical education is offered in middle school, high school, 2-year community and technical colleges, as well as other post-secondary schools. And career and technical education is designed to prepare high school students to transition successfully to post-secondary education. It is also designed to help college students acquire the skills and knowledge that are needed to find gainful employment. And it is designed to help workers acquire job skills in new fields or to refresh skills  in their existing career path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 18 of the 20 fastest growing occupations within the next decade will require career and technical education. And according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 40 percent of employers report that job applicants need better skills in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Career and technical education programs are an integral part of the public education system and are designed to educate for careers. Career and technical education prepares students for more than just a good-paying job; it is the beginning of a career path. And in today's workforce and economy, it is essential that students and workers remain life-long learners because the cutting edge skills don't remain cutting edge for long. Access to formal and informal training opportunities is critical  to remain competitive. Career and technical education programs are the solution for securing this type of training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's career and technical education programs are increasingly incorporating rigorous and challenging academic content standards. They provide a non-duplicative sequence of courses leading to an industry-recognized credential or certificate, or an associate or baccalaureate degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The programs of study offered through career and technical education are essential for our students and our workforce. For these reasons I stand in support of Career and Technical Education Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I also thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird)  for introducing this bill. At some time I would hope he would answer whether skiing is considered part of career and technical education in his bill. And I ask my colleagues, in the bipartisan spirit that permeates our committee, to support this bill as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) as much time as he shall consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friends and colleagues from Connecticut and Utah. The reference was I had the privilege of graduating from the University of Utah where, to some degree, I majored in skiing, and for me it was a career and technical path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to be here today to speak in support of <bill type="hr" number="930">H. Res. 930</bill>, a resolution introduced by myself and my good friend from Pennsylvania, Phil English. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical Education Month, which we are celebrating this month of February. This resolution expresses the support of the House of Representatives for the goals and ideals of Career and Technical Education Month, recognizes the importance of career and technical education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce, and encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to promote career and technical education as an option to  students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country is currently facing a growing problem of not having enough qualified workers to fill high-demand jobs. Across the Nation, employers are facing difficulties in finding skilled employees. Indeed, one survey showed that nearly 75 percent of employers report severe difficulties trying to hire qualified workers. Career and technical education provides students with the skills they need to find employment in skilled professions and to compete in a growing and competitive global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Career and technical education also helps students receive and complete their education. Those who participate in these programs have higher grade point averages in college and are less likely to drop out. In fact, according to the Department of Labor, career and technical education prepares students for all of the 20 fastest growing occupations in our Nation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Career and technical education is also unique in the way it engages students in their learning. I visited skill centers in my district, including the Clark County Skills Center and the New Market Skills Center in Thurston County last year, and I found students genuinely interested and involved in the classroom and in their education. Indeed, in my school visits, it is not at all uncommon to go to one, apparently, academic class, where students seem disinterested or maybe bored with their course  of study. You encounter them somewhat later in the career and tech courses, and they're motivated, enlightened and enthused. Indeed, I could well imagine a young person saying they have no concern at all for what the Pythagorean Theorem is; A squared plus B squared equals C squared doesn't mean anything to them until they realize that's how you frame a roof, and that suddenly has relevance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the Federal Government needs to focus more attention and resources on career and technical education. The Federal Government funds career and tech ed through the Perkins Act, which is the primary source of funding for career and technical education at the local level. Unfortunately, as we debate this resolution on the House floor, the administration has once again proposed eliminating funding for these programs. In fact, the Perkins grant program has not received a substantial increase  in funding since 2002. I am hopeful we will not only honor career and technical education today, but work in the months ahead to restore funding for these very important programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to applaud the Association for Career and Technical Education for its efforts. I also want to recognize the more than 15 million students currently involved in career and technical education in this country, and the more than 19,000 institutions that are presently offering career and technical education programs nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those folks who are studying and teaching in career and tech programs should know that they have friends and allies here in the Congress. In fact, last year I joined my colleague from Pennsylvania in creating the Congressional Career and Technical Education Caucus. This bipartisan group is working to raise awareness of the benefits of career and technical education in Congress and to support funding and policies to benefit career and technical education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my fellow Members to join the caucus and work with us to expand and strengthen career and technical education in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would just offer a suggestion to my friends and colleagues in this institution and those colleagues who happen to be running for President. We often, in our political speeches, say things like, we want to make college education more affordable. Well, as a former college instructor and a chair of the department, I believe we ought to make college education more affordable, but I would encourage all of us to insert the words "career and technical education" when we talk about supporting  education in this country. We should make career and technical education every bit as high a priority, as high in prestige, and as fully supported financially as we endeavor to do with college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would like to close by thanking again the chairman of the committee, Chairman Miller, and Ranking Member McKeon. And I would also like to thank my good colleagues who spoke on this issue today. I look forward to working with them on issues relating to career and tech education, and I urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400385" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="930">H. Res. 930</bill>, and especially in support of Indiana Tech in Fort Wayne, Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, Mr. Speaker, there is a huge need for high-skilled workers, and Indiana Tech plays a critical role in helping our region meet this demand. Each year Indiana Tech provides thousands of students opportunities to "skill up," so that they can better contribute to local employers and better provide for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the top 20 fastest-growing occupations in our country are supplied by career and technical education. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that nearly three-quarters of employers struggle to hire qualified workers. Clearly the need for career and technical education is severe, and we in Congress must do what we can to encourage its growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In northeast Indiana--as in the rest of the country--a high quality education is critical to obtaining a good, well-paying job. While northeast Indiana is still a manufacturing center of the country, these jobs are becoming increasingly more high-tech and require higher levels of skills and training. Schools like Indiana Tech are helping prepare students for these changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as competition in our global economy continues to grow more fierce, career and technical education is essential to preparing a well-educated, skilled workforce. I ask that my colleagues join with me in expressing support for Indiana Tech and schools like it. They are critical to the future of northeast Indiana, and they are critical to the future of our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="930">H. Res. 930</bill>, supporting the goals and ideas of Career and Technical Education Month, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Washington, Representative Baird. This important piece of legislation expands the pathways to social and economic mobility, for more people in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Career and technical education is a substantial enterprise in this country. Thousands of comprehensive high schools, vocational and technical high schools, area vocational centers, and community colleges offer career and technical education programs. Virtually every high school student takes at least one career and technical education course, and one in four students takes three or more courses in a single program area. One-third of college students are involved in career and technical programs,  and as many as 40 million adults engage in short-term postsecondary occupational training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty-five years after the passage of the first piece of Federal vocational education legislation, career and technical education is evolving from its original and sole focus on preparing students for work immediately following high school. Today's career and technical education programs increasingly incorporate rigorous and challenging academic  content standards and provide a nonduplicative sequence of courses leading to an industry-recognized credential  or certificate, or an associate or bachelor's degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, we have several vocational and technical schools and programs such as the Bradford School, ITT Technical Institute, Everest Institute, Remington College at Houston, and American Intercontinental University in Houston. Each of these schools and programs is committed to providing the skills and technical knowledge necessary for entry-level employment positions in business and industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Career and technical education is about helping students, workers, and lifelong learners of all ages fulfill their working potential. First and foremost it's about high school and college education that provides students with: (1) academic subject matter taught with relevance to the real world, often called contextual learning, (2) second-chance education and training for the unemployed and those seeking to upgrade their employability skills, and (3) corporate training, continuing education,  skills upgrades and refresher courses for those already in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join Congressman Baird in raising awareness about the increased need for career and tech programs that will better prepare and train America's growing workforce. I have long supported education initiatives that not only seek to educate, but to also inspire entrepreneurship. I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Just to close, Mr. Speaker, again, Congressman Baird, who is a passionate advocate on this issue, I think said it all. For all the reasons that he stated and Mr. Bishop from Utah, I would urge all Members to support this resolution and its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
