  <narrative>PRICE OF GASOLINE -- (Senate - June 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5360">S5360</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I spent part of this morning visiting with some experts about the issue of energy speculation and the price of gasoline. I am very concerned about the price of gasoline. I come from a State that not only produces a lot of energy but uses a lot of petroleum products. We are a farm State and a big State with a sparse population. North Dakota is spread over the equivalent of 10 Massachusettses in landmass. We use a lot of energy per capita. When the price does what it  has been doing recently, it is very harmful to a rural State that does a lot of family farming and requires people to travel a lot because of its sheer size.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what happened to oil prices in the last year: They have doubled. There is no justification for that--none. There is no justification for this at all. Get this, crude oil futures hit a record $139 per barrel today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I used to teach a little economics in college--not in a serious way. I taught the supply and demand intersection and what happens to price. I understand all that. If we take a look at supply and demand, there is nothing that justifies what is happening in the futures market with respect to oil prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now back up 14 months, in fact, to the time prior to the price of oil doubling and ask yourself what happened in this world. Were we oblivious then to the fact that India and China were going to want more fuel in their economies? I understand there are probably 150 million Chinese who want to drive cars. Where are they going to get the fuel? A lot of folks in India want to drive cars too. I understand all of that. These signals were already in the market 16 and 18 months ago. That is not different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is also what I understand. Since the first part of this year, our inventories of petroleum stocks have been going up in this country and use has been going down. People are driving slightly less and using less. So what is happening to price? It has doubled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell you what I think is happening. On the oil commodity markets, we have a dramatic orgy of speculation and carnival of greed. Are all of the speculators who are neck deep in these markets there because they want oil or want to hold oil? Have they tried to lift a 42-gallon drum? I don't think so. They want to make money speculating. As a result all of this excess speculation, they are driving up the price of a commodity. That damages this country and injures most Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what has happened to speculation. This Congress and this President have a responsibility to stop it. When excess speculation damages an economy, damages the country and its people, we have a responsibility to stop excess speculation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a picture of NYMEX, where they trade commodities. Most people have seen pictures of the floor of a trading session like this. In fact, I think it was 80 years ago when Will Rogers talked about these guys buying things they will never get from people who never had it. At NYMEX, they trade futures contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me describe what one fellow testified before the Energy Committee. By the way, he has had 30 or 35 years as an executive analyst in these markets. Fadel Gheit said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I am absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. I called it the world's largest gambling hall. It's open 24/7. Unfortunately, it is totally unregulated. This is like a highway with no cops and no speed limits, and everybody is going 120 miles an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the New Jersey Star Ledger wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent to the cost of a barrel of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The president of Marathon Oil, Clarence Cazalot, Jr., said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is an oil executive saying this price isn't justified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stephen Simon, a senior vice president at Exxon, said on April 1, 2008:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how did we get here? On December 15, 2000, in this Chamber, one of our colleagues, Senator Gramm from Texas, stuck a little provision into the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which was included in a very big piece of legislation that was being enacted. I believe it was the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2000, a large supplemental bill being done. That little provision changed everything. Prior to that time, prior to Senator Gramm from Texas putting this provision into law,  every futures contract in this country was subject to regulation and oversight. Senator Gramm stuck a provision in a very big piece of legislation that said essentially certain commodity provisions need not be subject to regulation and oversight. Then it started. That was called the Enron loophole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know something about that because I chaired the hearings at which the late Ken Lay, the CEO and president of Enron Corporation, testified. He raised his hand, took an oath, sat down, and  then took the fifth amendment. He ran one of the biggest energy companies in this country. We found out that at least part of it was a criminal enterprise. It benefitted greatly by the actions of the Congress, and only a few in the Congress knew what they were trying  to do. That created this loophole by which Enron and others down the road could create an energy market that was unregulated, outside of the view of regulators and of the grasp of regulators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now, going forward from December 15, 2000, to today, what is happening is that we have seen, outside of the purview of regulators, a dramatic amount, an obscene amount of speculation in energy markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have met with experts who have said that there is no speculation here. Yesterday, I met with a person yesterday, someone who is an expert in this area and runs a major corporation, who said there is no speculation here. That is just wrong. That is false on its face. All one has to do is look at what is happening in these markets. Can anybody, anyplace, anytime, anywhere tell us that something has happened in the last 14 months in terms of the market fundamentals that justifies doubling the  price of oil or gasoline? There is nothing that justifies that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress cannot sit around any longer. I know the President and the Vice President opposed responding to the electricity crisis out West when they first came to office. I recall when some of us in Congress were trying to take some action against what was happening to hijack wholesale electric prices on the West Coast by the Enron Corporation that they stood by idly. I and others pushed and pushed. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said there is nothing going on there. Dick Cheney  made fun of us, saying these markets are working, we just don't like markets. The President didn't want to do anything. We finally found out what was something illegal happening. Every day was criminal. They were manipulating supply in a criminal way, and there are people sitting in prison for it. Ken</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That cannot continue to be replicated now. We have to do something to soak the speculation out of these futures markets. There needs to be a futures market for energy, I support that. There are legitimate hedging requirements, I understand that. There needs to be liquidity, I understand that. But when you have excessive speculation that damages this country and runs up the price of oil to double the price when, in fact, the market fundamentals do not justify it. Hedge funds, investment banks,  and many others rush into these markets in order to make profits through speculation and the public be damned. It doesn't matter what it does to the country, then something is wrong, and it is the responsibility of the Congress to act. It is our responsibility and requirement. We cannot sit around and ignore this any longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a call from the owner of a trucking company in North Dakota the other day. They have been running a trucking firm for years. His dad ran it, and his family has been running it for four or five decades. He said: I don't think we can continue. We can't afford the price of diesel fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand we have had 12 airlines that have gone into bankruptcy. I know of five in the last 6 or 8 weeks. The fact is, this country cannot exist without a vibrant aviation industry. We have to have airline companies that are able to move Americans back and forth across the country. The price of jet fuel is even worse than the description I just offered with respect to gasoline and oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to work on this issue in a very aggressive and urgent way, and we need to do something that shuts down this speculation. I indicated yesterday that I am working on legislation to try to do that and to try to make certain we have a completely regulated system with respect to the trading of these contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, they ought to be regulated. Some say that, if we try to regulate them here, they will move offshore. We ought to be able to regulate it. If you are in this country, you want to play games in the commodities markets as a speculator, if you are picking up a telephone and trade commodities in this country, as far as I am concerned, you ought to be regulated with respect to your order of commodities contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of work is being done. As I said, I spent part of this morning with experts who understand the complexities and the vagaries of these commodity markets and especially the oil markets and the speculation that is occurring. I side with those who believe there is excessive speculation and that there is a requirement that we do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
