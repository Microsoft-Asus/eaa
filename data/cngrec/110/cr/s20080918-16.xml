  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to talk about another matter which has to do with the public safety of our people. Public safety is among the highest priorities of Government. Americans should feel--and have a right to feel--safe in their homes, their neighborhoods, and their communities. Although the national violent crime rate has dropped substantially since 2000, we know any crime is too much crime. As elected officials, we ought to do what we can to prevent criminal acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, my home State of Florida has, unfortunately, seen a rise in violent crime--a very sharp increase. If we look at the numbers in recent years, there is a clear trend: The murder rate in Florida rose more than 28 percent in 2006 and another 6.5 percent in 2007. Instances of armed robbery increased by 13.4 percent in 2006 and nearly 12 percent in 2007. So while the overall crime rate rose only 1.4 percent--and it was the first time in more than a decade--we did see a rise in violent  crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the crimes committed in Florida are being committed by those with prior records and those who are already fugitives from justice. A U.S. Marshal--a good friend--told me fugitives from justice posed the most risk to society because they have to keep committing crimes in order to keep going and crime then becomes their livelihood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is why, since the creation of the U.S. Marshals Service, their priority has been to capture fugitives. They work closely with local and State law enforcement agencies, they devote the resources necessary to track fugitives across State lines, and they have  several regional task forces set up specifically to go after the worst of the worst criminals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, my State of Florida falls under the purview of the Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force based in Atlanta, GA. Given Florida's size, its population, and the escalation of violent crimes, we need a special focus to more effectively target those responsible for the most serious of crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I requested the resources necessary to establish a regional Fugitive Task Force in Florida. We secured $2.8 million, and while not enough to establish a task force, it did provide the resources to increase the Marshals' presence in my State. Over the past 10 weeks, the Marshals Service put those resources to work in an effort that they call "Operation Orange Crush."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and other places, the Marshals Service linked up with other State and local law enforcement agencies and targeted the worst of the worst fugitive criminals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They went after murderers, rapists, child sex offenders, and gang members, and they very specifically went after violent offenders. The results were absolutely astonishing. Nearly 2,500 fugitives were apprehended. More than 2,900 warrants were cleared, 113 homicide suspects were arrested, and 255 sex offenders were also captured. They also took in 76 firearms and about 100 pounds of illicit narcotics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among those captured in Operation Orange Crush was fugitive David Lee Green, an escapee listed on the Marshals' 15 Most Wanted list, and a criminal who has been on the run since the year 2000, out there committing more and more crime. Green was found in Titusville after escaping from a Federal correctional institution in Elkton, OH, where he was serving a 235-month sentence for cocaine distribution. In addition, he was wanted for machinegun possession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another captured fugitive, Rosalino Yanez, was arrested in Okeechobee County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Authorities in Fort Pierce wanted him for a 2003 murder, when he apparently used a shotgun to fire and kill two men. He is also wanted in Georgia for attempting to commit murder there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another arrested was Nolan Woods, who was captured in Miami on a warrant for sexual assault of a minor. So this man was also captured and put behind bars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are some of the more than 2,400 arrests that were made. These were made possible because of the additional resources this Congress made available to the U.S. Marshals Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given these statistics and what the Marshals Service was able to do in a 10-week period--in just 10 weeks in my State--demonstrates that there needs to be a permanent Regional Fugitive Task Force in Florida. Rising violent crime rates pose a serious threat to our children, our families, and our communities. These results demonstrate that Florida has a need, and the resources used will yield the desired results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Establishing a permanent Regional Fugitive Task Force in Florida will require Congress's support through the fiscal year 2009 and beyond. But given the results of Operation Orange Crush and the outstanding commitment of the U.S. Marshals Service, I am very hopeful we can take the results of this task force and make this be a reality in the coming days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am very pleased, and I wish to give a word of thanks not only to the Marshals Service but also to all law enforcement in the State of Florida who worked together cooperatively to make this terrific result happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
