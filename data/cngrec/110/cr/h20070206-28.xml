  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to draw attention to an honor recently received by my home community back in Lenawee County, Michigan. America's Promise--The Alliance for Youth, a foundation formed in 1997 to help children and youth from all socioeconomic sectors in the United States, recently named Lenawee County one of the 100 best communities for young people as part of its 10-year anniversary celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The criteria for winning included strong community support of children and youth, possessing valuable resources for children and youth, youth and child outcomes, overall progress within communities, and innovations in the areas of policy, practice, and resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Communities in 38 States received this award and Lenawee County is one of the five communities in the Great Lakes State to be named a winner. This recognition is a tribute to all of the police officers, local officials, firefighters, outstanding teachers, community leaders and civil servants that make Lenawee County and south-central Michigan a great place to live.</paragraph>
