    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week marks the third anniversary of the imprisonment of Egyptian parliamentarian and presidential candidate Ayman Nour. He was jailed on charges of forgery during the 2005 presidential elections in Egypt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nour suffers from numerous health problems. He has been subjected to documented physical abuse and has been denied visitation rights afforded to other prisoners. His health condition continues to worsen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members of Congress stand in solidarity with Ayman Nour and respectfully call on President Mubarak to grant his unconditional release. December 10 is Human Rights Day, marking the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In honor of that day, the Egyptian Government should release Ayman Nour. This action would symbolize a recommitment to the inherent dignity of all people and to their equal and inalienable rights.</paragraph>
