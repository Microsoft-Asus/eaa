  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I send a concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="313">H. Con. Res. 313</bill>, to the desk and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.</narrative>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the right to object, but I will not object. I simply want to point out this is a very important thing that we should do for our troops. I'm delighted that someone has suggested that we use the rotunda for this purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know how difficult it has been for the troops in both Afghanistan and Iraq and in other parts of the world. We also know that there is not universal support in our country for the work that they are doing, and this makes their job doubly difficult. So I'm very pleased to support this resolution and make certain that we truly and properly honor the work of our Armed Forces and their families throughout the world when they work in such difficult circumstances.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, I would be delighted to yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would just note that, as the gentleman has mentioned, it is important that we honor the 5 years of service and sacrifice of our troops and their families in the war in Iraq and remember our troops serving in Afghanistan and throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note that Ranking Member Ehlers is a cosponsor of this resolution, and both conflicts are still ongoing. Our troops' efforts have gone above and beyond the call of duty. Their sacrifice and dedication to their country must be honored, as well as the sacrifice and dedication of American troops stationed at home and around the world. And I am pleased that we will have this important recognition in the people's House, in the rotunda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, I simply want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her good comments. And I hope every Member of this Congress will join us in approving this particular resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.</paragraph>
