  <speaking speaker="400620" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the administration has turned a projected 10-year, $5.6 billion surplus into a nearly $3 trillion deficit. Over the past 6 years, America's debt has climbed 50 percent to more than $28,000 per person. It is so bad that this administration has borrowed more money from foreign nations than all previous 42 U.S. Presidents combined. That is the fiscal mess that we inherit from the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe it is time that we finally get our fiscal house in order. Today, we will restore the pay-as-you-go rules that were instrumental to the budget surpluses we experienced in the early 1990s. Pay-as-you-go budgeting with no new deficit spending is a key first step. This will reverse the budget deficits that are currently passing billions of dollars in debt to our children and our grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was wrong to eliminate pay-as-you-go in 2002. We need to begin to treat our Federal budget in the way that working families treat their budgets, and pay-as-you-go is a good first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I hope that this House can act in a bipartisan fashion to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington.</paragraph>
