  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a man well acquainted with crisis, Abraham Lincoln, said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to affirm this confidence and lay out some of the basic facts and principles we face in this unprecedented financial crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fact No. 1: We live in a world which is very different from the realities of a decade ago. The financial world is interconnected and reacts at the speed of digital transactions. There are no borders to hide behind or cooling off periods in which to contemplate at our leisure. Problems arise quickly and solutions must be found quickly yet responsibly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fact No. 2: This crisis we face today touches each and every American. As the recent market events have proven, the crisis has entered a new and critically dangerous phase in which our entire financial system and economy hangs in the balance. The crisis we face today is as serious as any I have faced in my 32 years of public service. When the Secretary of the Treasury talks about the possibility of a collapse of the American financial system, that gets your attention, as it should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Money market accounts, retirement savings, college and small business loans, and home mortgages are all at stake. This is not about Wall Street but about Main Street. It is about every street on which American families live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just think of what you have to tell your son or daughter if they got accepted to some great school, and you are about to get that loan that you need to pay for that education, and then all of a sudden it is not there.  Credit has dried up. Capital is not available. You are going to have to say: By the way, you can't go there now. I am sorry. Mom and dad cannot afford it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small business owners depend on credit to stock their shelves, to supply the goods we buy. If this system collapses, freezes, how are they going to go about providing both goods and services to families, as well as the jobs of folks who work there? This is about every street on which American families live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fact No. 3: This crisis, not unlike energy or health care, is too big for one party to solve. We must work together--Democrats, Republicans, House and Senate, administration and Congress. There was a moment of opportunity yesterday with the White House, Senator Obama and Senator McCain, and the leadership of both sides of the aisle from both Houses. After the debate tonight, we have to get back, as Americans, to figure out how we put this together to provide the stability this  economy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People have asked a lot of questions about how we got there. Outright greed and mismanagement, coupled with an outdated financial regulatory system, have all been part of bringing us to this point. People were sold loans they could not afford. In some instances, I heard of ninja mortgages: no income, jobs, or assets, and yet they got packaged and securitized and passed on and sold to investors throughout the country and the world. Now it seems these securities are not worth what was paid for  them. It has not only put companies in dire straits but our entire financial system as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our obligation now as Americans is to come together and do the right thing, and to do it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fact No. 4: The American people are watching. I have already heard from over 11,000 Minnesotans who have called or written to my office who have expressed their deep concerns about what is happening and what is being proposed. They say: Don't bail out Wall Street. My calls are running 10,000 against and maybe 100-and-something for. They say: Don't bail out Wall Street. Unfortunately, the way this stabilization plan was presented was such in which the public watched and saw it that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Paulson proposed a $700 billion plan to rescue our financial system. People are concerned the plan did not provide for clear transparency, it did not provide for clear oversight. The consensus is, it amounted to a bailout of Wall Street. This is not what the American people want nor should they have that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I share the administration's sense of urgency to act, I share the concerns of Minnesotans from all across the State and certainly Americans all cross the country. So I want to assure folks back home I am not going to move forward on a plan unless it puts taxpayers first and holds Wall Street accountable. But I also want to tell my citizens that it is our obligation and responsibility, before we get out of here--before we get out of here this weekend--to in fact put in place a plan that  puts taxpayers first and holds Wall Street accountable. We need to get there. We must get there. We need a plan that provides effective oversight and transparency. We are not</paragraph>
    <paragraph>going to give the Treasury Department a blank check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is talk about taking some of the options that have been put on the table and been discussed in the last days, that instead of $700 billion as a blank check, that there are X dollars put up first, with the obligation to come back for further approval, with very clear and specific oversight, very clear and specific transparency. We must get there with a plan that holds Wall Street executives accountable for the terrible mistakes they made getting us into this mess--no golden parachutes. We  are going to have to deal with executive compensation. If there is going to be Government assets involved, if they use the Government credit card, folks are going to have to comply with the terms and conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must look into other individuals who enrich themselves on mortgage-related assets while fully knowing of their dangers. There is going to be a lot of looking back. In the long run, shareholders have to have a greater say about executive pay. We must get there with a plan that gets taxpayers the best value for their dollar. If we, ultimately, go forward with the Treasury's plan--or a variation of the plan because we are not going to go forward with that plan--this will be a plan in which the  concerns of my colleagues in the House--they have expressed concerns; my colleagues in the Senate have expressed concerns. We need to go forward in a way that assures that distressed assets are bought--and when I say "bought"--that distressed assets are acquired--I want to be clear about that--acquired at prices that are fair to the taxpayer and any returns that we get as assets come back into this fund after expended, that they have to go to debt reduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about increasing the national debt from over $10.6 trillion to over $11 trillion. As assets come back, as distressed assets regain value over time, as folks get back on their feet, we have to make sure those assets then are put into debt reduction, not more Government spending, not deepening the mess we are in already in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the long term, we cannot go back to business as usual. We need to aggressively undertake fundamental financial regulatory reform. First and foremost, any reform must include stronger regulatory oversight over the entire financial system. The sad reality is that some of our current system goes back to the Civil War era. It is like trying to fight a fire today with a bucket brigade. It is marked by ineffective coordination among regulators and redundant oversight in some areas and lack of  oversight in others. Greater transparency and accountability must be factored in. We must ensure that market participants have a direct stake in their own actions so that taxpayers are not left holding the bag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, it has been described to me as almost a 9/11 kind of moment--that before 9/11, in the area of security, we were not able to think the unthinkable, and we did not have in place a system that allowed us to see and understand that the unthinkable was about to happen. In the situation we face now with this economy, we did not have the regulatory oversight, the transparency to deal with the complex financial instruments that are being used today, so we both did not think the unthinkable  and we had no capacity to know that the unthinkable was about to happen. The unthinkable now stands in the shadows, as we talk about the potential meltdown of the American economic system. That cannot happen, and we will not let that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we must put more cops on the beat to better detect possible threats to the financial system, such as conflicts of interest that could undermine the integrity of the system. And, finally, we must ensure greater regulatory flexibility in order to keep up with market innovations. Regulators should have the ability to intervene before a crisis reaches critical mass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens after the opening bell rings on Wall Street every day affects the folks in Hibbing, MN, just as much as the people in New York City. Wall Street executives must shoulder a great deal of responsibility for this crisis. If taxpayers are being asked to sacrifice, Wall Street too must share in the cost of rescuing the financial system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hardworking Americans deserve to have the peace of mind that their stake in the financial system is appropriately safeguarded and that they are not put on the hook for the mistakes of corporate America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Times are tough. Folks are having a hard enough time dealing with high energy costs and making ends meet. In the short term, we need to act for the sake of our economy. In the long term, we need major reform that protects the American taxpayer and works for our economy. Maintaining a viable and robust financial system is critical to each and every American's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to recognize there are a lot of questions out there, even at this hour on Friday night, as we are moving toward what I hope will be putting in place a system that protects the taxpayer, that holds Wall Street accountable. We are talking about assets, and there is a discussion about Government buying assets. At what price? If we buy it above market price, are taxpayers being ripped off to protect shareholders and bondholders? That should not be  allowed  to happen. If we are to buy assets, then what kind of system do we need to have in place to evaluate and oversee those assets? Are we creating more bureaucracy, more cost, for which, in the end, the taxpayers will suffer?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Could we avoid that, while looking at loans--secure loans, of course, being preferable--but even in cases where there are not enough assets to secure the loans, moving forward from a loan perspective?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the kinds of questions I know those at the table right now need to answer. They need to answer them with a first and foremost principle that the taxpayers must be protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I wish to say that even as we move forward--as we have to move forward to provide stability to the American economic system--we must understand that this is not getting us out of the woods; that, in fact, those challenges to our economy are still there, including the threat of the recession, or the reality of the recession, and I think the economic numbers from this quarter will demonstrate that it is, in fact, where we are today. But greater danger lies ahead in our financial system,  so the expenditure of Government resources now must be done in a way that keeps in mind that there are going to be some major issues that are going to have to be confronted in the near future. There may have to be some further action by this Government to provide stability in order to keep this country moving forward. Those considerations cannot be blocked out as we look at the crisis of the moment. We need to recognize that there are challenges that still await us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people throughout our history have come together at every crisis that has threatened our national or economic security. We, in Congress, working closely with the administration, must protect their interests by working quickly, in a bipartisan way, to help secure a better, safer, and sounder tomorrow. Now is the time for statesmanship, not partisanship. Now is the time for leadership. Now is the time to come together to generate confidence in the American body politic and in the people  that will then reflect confidence in our economic system, that will give the opportunity for a better and brighter future.</paragraph>
