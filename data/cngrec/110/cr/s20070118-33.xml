    <paragraph>Madam President, today I pay tribute to LaMesa Marks-Johns of Louisville, KY, for being recognized as one of America's top educators in the 2006 Milken Family Foundation National Educator Awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The annual Milken Family Foundation National Educator Award was established in 1985, and recipients consist of a network of teachers, principals, and specialists who serve as experts for policymakers seeking to improve the quality of teachers and public education. Award recipients assist in developing comprehensive strategies and policies to ensure that every child receives the highest quality educational experience possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Marks-Johns, a teacher at Shacklette Elementary School, has been recognized by the Milken Family Foundation for her continuing efforts to provide educational experiences in the classroom. She inspires her students to achieve academically and contribute to the community. Ms. Marks-Johns sets an example of leadership for both colleagues and students alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in thanking Ms. Marks-Johns for her dedication and commitment to education. In order for our society to continue to advance in the right direction, we must have teachers like LaMesa Marks-Johns in our schools, in our communities, and in our lives. She is Kentucky at its finest.</paragraph>
