  <speaking speaker="412230" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Congress must immediately send our troops the resources that they need to win this war, without strings and without delay. But instead, the Democrat leadership is proposing to tie the hands of our troops and hamstring our generals with a misguided plan to micromanage the war effort. This is just unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Los Angeles Times has said, "It's absurd to try and micromanage this conflict and the evolution of Iraqi society with arbitrary time lines and benchmarks." And I agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is absurd to assume that this war can be planned by 535 Members of Congress instead of our generals and our Commander in Chief. War by committee is not an option. I encourage the Democrat leadership of Congress to bring forth immediately a clean bill that provides the necessary funds for our troops and leaves tactical decisions in the hands of our generals and those who are experts.</paragraph>
