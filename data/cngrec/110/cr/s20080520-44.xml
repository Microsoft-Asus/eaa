    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the exemplary model of service and conservation provided by the Student Creative Recycle Art Program Gallery as it celebrates Earth Month Coachella Valley. Their efforts to highlight the importance of environmental consciousness through community activities provides an example for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 30 years, America has recognized the importance of environmental preservation, and we have dedicated every April 22, Earth Day, as a day for environmental consciousness. The S.C.R.A.P. Gallery has taken bold steps to heighten America's awareness of conservation in dedicating the entire month of April to environmental awareness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the month of April, the S.C.R.A.P. Gallery operates a number of enrichment activities throughout southern California, aimed at improving youth education and environmental awareness. Events such as field trips that highlight the importance of waste prevention, recycling programs that encourage youth to transform used bicycles into artwork, theater productions that enable students to attend professional children's theater performances focused on conservation, and hands-on events that  allow students to gain direction from local and renowned artists have helped engage youth throughout southern California and helped to highlight the importance of environmental concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than a decade, the S.C.R.A.P. Gallery has been recognized as an integral community organization by numerous organizations and municipalities. The S.C.R.A.P. Gallery has received the Arts Organization Award from the city of Indio, the Best Grassroots Organization Award from the U.S. Department of Education, the Waste Reduction Award from the California Integrated Waste Management Board, the Keep California Beautiful Award, the Governor's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award, and  the Award of Achievement in Education from the Natural Resources Council of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, as the S.C.R.A.P. Gallery dedicates an entire month to conservation and environmental awareness, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their tremendous leadership. The efforts of the S.C.R.A.P. Gallery have successfully engaged communities of young people and have highlighted the importance of environmental awareness throughout their community.</paragraph>
