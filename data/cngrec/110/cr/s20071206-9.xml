    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request I am going to enter in just a minute, but I would like to say that I extend my congratulations to LAMAR ALEXANDER in his recent victory to be part of the Republican leadership. I respect and admire him. He will do a wonderful job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also extend my appreciation to Mr. JON KYL, a Senator from Arizona, a neighboring State of Nevada's, who is going to replace TRENT LOTT. I have expressed to Senator Kyl personally--I haven't had that opportunity with Senator Alexander because we didn't know how that vote would turn out, but I expressed to Senator Kyl my admiration and respect for him. I know he will do a good job for the State of Arizona, the country, and the Senate, and I look forward  to working with both of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we often do on the Senate floor, as Senator Kyl knows--before coming here he was a distinguished lawyer, and I spent a lot of time in the courtroom myself--it is totally appropriate that we on the Senate floor advocate for our constituency, for our party, and for individual Senators in the best way we know how. But it is also very important that we maintain cordial relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we learned in our court experiences, no matter how difficult the case might be, no matter how tense it might be arguing to a jury or to a judge, when that courtroom is adjourned, the attorneys walk out, shake hands, go have a sandwich, have a drink, and go on and prepare for the next case. And that is what I say to my friends, LAMAR ALEXANDER and JON KYL. We are going to have some debates on the Senate floor. That is what the Senate is all about. Some say it is the greatest debating  organization in the history of the world. I don't know whether that is the case, but I have been involved in a few debates and a few tense times on the floor, but I always try--and I haven't always been totally successful at this--to put my emotions aside and walk off the Senate floor and try to be friends with those I was advocating against.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to these two fine Senators from the States of Tennessee and Arizona, I wish them the very best in their new duties.</paragraph>
