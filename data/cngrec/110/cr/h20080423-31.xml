  <narrative>HONORING NORM "JACK" SNOW -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2559]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the past 30 year, Norm "Jack" Snow has been a familiar face in the town of Milo, Yates County, New York, serving as councilman for 12 years before moving into the supervisor position for the last 18 years. Jack has offered his strength, his courage, his convictions to the town of Milo. He announced his retirement at the beginning of this year, much to the dismay of the people he represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of upstate New York, Jack grew up on a dairy farm walking one mile to a one-room schoolhouse, in which he jokes was "uphill both ways." Jack didn't grow up dreaming of politics but decided he could make a difference in the community that he loved. Besides his 30 years of public service, Jack is an active member in the community serving as the President of the Shrine Club, which enables 700 school children from around the State to attend the Shrine Circus each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack cites that the reason he stayed in politics for 30 years was because of the terrific people he worked with every day. But it was us who were blessed to work with Jack, and more importantly, blessed to know him. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
