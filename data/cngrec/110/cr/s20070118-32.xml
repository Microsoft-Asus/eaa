    <paragraph>Madam President, yesterday morning, January 17, a convoy carrying a staff member of the National Democratic Institute and members of her security team was ambushed in Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Andrea Parhamovich, an American citizens, was killed. Three other NDI employees, citizens from Croatia, Hungary, and Iraq, also lost their lives in the attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since June 2003, the National Democratic Institute has been working with Iraqi citizens, outside the Green Zone and at great risk, to help build the foundations on which a true democracy depends. I did not know Ms. Parhamovich, whose life was taken so tragically yesterday. But all of us recognize the ideals which inspired her to undertake such a dangerous mission for her country and the people of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my deepest respect and appreciation to her last true measure of devotion to democratic ideals. To her family, and the families of those who were also killed, I offer my deepest condolences.</paragraph>
