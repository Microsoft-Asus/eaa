    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> and in support of the McKeon alternative. As the father of three college graduates and a college sophomore, I understand the financial burden higher education poses on families and students. That is why I am proud of Republican efforts, particularly those of Representatives Buck McKeon and Ric Keller to expand college access and increase affordability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As lawmakers, our number one education priority should be to ensure that college is affordable for any student. Unfortunately, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> pits the Federal Family Education Loan program against the Direct Loan Program and creates an imbalance in the student loan industry. Instead of helping students, the Democrat entitlement bill would require student borrowers to pay thousands more for a college education. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> creates nine new entitlement programs, placing the interests of colleges and universities  above the needs of low-income students, and does nothing to expand college access and affordability for middle-class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should not be playing politics with college educations. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the McKeon alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
