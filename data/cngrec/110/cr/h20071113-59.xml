  <narrative>SECOND CHANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13828]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the House on the passage of <bill type="h" number="1593">H.R. 1593</bill>, the Second Chance Act. I congratulate my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Danny Davis, who has worked so long and so hard on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation because so many of our citizens who have been led off course deserve a second chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Nation's crime rates have fallen over the last decade, there has been an unprecedented explosion in prison and jail populations, of which 650,000 men and women are released from State and Federal prisons each year, and an even larger number of people are being released from our local jails.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These individuals are arriving on the doorsteps of my neighborhood in Baltimore and in neighborhoods across this great country. Unfortunately, we are failing to integrate far too many of these returning neighbors into the economic and social life of our communities. And, as a result, they are returning to crime and, before long, returning to prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly two-thirds of released prisoners are expected to be rearrested for felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years of release. Such high recidivism rates translate into thousands of new crimes each year, at least half of which can be averted through improved prisoner reentry efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me, these statistics are not nameless and faceless people. They are very real. I live in the inner city of Baltimore, where approximately 700 to 800 former prisoners are reentering our neighborhoods from prison every month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of good work is being done in the City of Baltimore to move these individuals on the path to productive citizenship; however, we can do much more and we can do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Second Chance Act will do just that by addressing critical breakdowns in the services provided. The legislation will strengthen overall efforts to reduce recidivism, increase public safety, and help States and cities to better address the growing population of ex-offenders returning to our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill focuses on development and support of programs that provide alternatives to incarceration, expand the availability of substance abuse treatment, strengthen families, and expand comprehensive reentry services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must end the vicious cycle of recidivism for the benefit of our communities and, indeed, our country. This is an issue that touches many of the problems that our society faces every day. Take, for example, the scourge of illicit drugs; 70 to 80 percent of offenders reentering the community have histories of substance abuse. And if the treatment they need is not sought or available upon release, relapse is likely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prison reentry programs are on the front lines of our national war on drugs, and they are desperately needed in communities like Baltimore City where this war has become increasingly violent. Ex-offenders need help to make a smooth transition into civilian life. Once they make that transition, they have the potential to serve as critical resources to our communities, acting as mentors to our young people and working to unravel the same criminal network to which they once belonged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reentry programs produce successful outcomes for our communities and our citizens, but they are also cost effective. Taxpayer dollars that could go to providing education, health care, or other vitally important services are instead going to support the costly criminal justice system. According to  the Bureau of Justice statistics, expenditures on corrections alone increased from $9 billion in 1992 to $44 billion in 1997. Those numbers have continued  to rise over the past decade. We stand to save billions of taxpayer dollars by reducing recidivism rates by steering our ex-offenders away from a life of crime and into a productive society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every human being deserves a second chance to turn his or her life around. That is why I am so glad that we have passed <bill type="h" number="1593">H.R. 1593</bill>, the Second Chance Act. And again, I thank Congressman DANNY DAVIS for his leadership in introducing and spearheading this legislation. I applaud all of my colleagues who voted in favor of it, and I urge the Senate to move swiftly.</paragraph>
