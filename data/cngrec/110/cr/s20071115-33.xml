    <paragraph>Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in congratulating Villa Madonna Academy Elementary and Junior High School of Villa Hills, KY. Villa Madonna Academy Elementary and Junior High School is recognized as a 2007 No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Blue Ribbon Schools Program has been celebrating high achieving schools for 25 years. Established in 1982 by the U.S. Department of Education, the program has recognized more than 5,200 schools since its inception. This year 11 Kentucky schools join this distinguished list, and I am proud to say that this is the second time Villa Madonna Academy Elementary and Junior High School has been a worthy recipient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By demanding excellence from each and every student, Villa Madonna  Academy Elementary and Junior High School truly celebrates the blue ribbon standard of excellence that the No Child Left Behind Program strives to achieve. Villa Madonna Academy Elementary and Junior High School exemplifies what our Kentucky schools can achieve when we have enough faith in our students to challenge them to their full potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Villa Madonna Academy Elementary and Junior High School on this achievement. The administrators, teachers, parents, and students of this school are an inspiration to the citizens of Kentucky. I look forward to all that Villa Madonna Academy Elementary and Junior High School accomplishes in the future.</paragraph>
