  <narrative>IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES -- (Senate - September 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8268">S8268</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail sent to me through energy</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>The gas prices have hit us so hard that my family cannot afford to fill up the tank but rather $50 at a time. To fill up my diesel tank, it now costs $160. We cannot afford vacations nor can we afford day trips to the mountains. If this is what the speculators wanted, well, they got it. We basically go to work to pay for fuel. I wanted to see my father this year in Bakersfield, California but  that is impossible now. That would be easily close to $1,000  in fuel.</narrative>
  <narrative>What is more frustrating is there is not a thing I can do about it. Groceries have gone up 20%, Idaho Power is planning on raising their rates, [the state of Idaho] wants to increase the car registration to $150. I give up! When my taxes increase (sales, fees, ssn, state, fed ) are more than 50%, I am planning on leaving the workforce and staying home to get all of the benefits of the poor and unemployed.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am absolutely for a free market economy, but with all of the taxes and fuel charges and surcharges on items that require transit, it is going to break this family.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am a [conservative, but have been disappointed with the partisan actions on many issues, including immigration, 2nd Amendment rights, national security. It sometimes feels like those we have elected to lead us have forgotten their responsibilities.]</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>I think we are technically smart enough to drill for oil without endangering the environment. I mean every place that oil can be found. If we listen to the extreme environmentalists, we will all starve to death in the dark!!!</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The lobbyist for the oil companies are too rich and have too many politicians in their pockets. The Solar lobby consists of one man begging for tax brakes. Do the math. The federal government really does not [care] about what we, the American people think so, the best thing we (Idaho) can do is to declare sovereignty from the NeoCon/Zionist regime and just live our lives in peace and harmony. Stop killing for oil. Politicians are not intelligent enough to run my life. They are not intelligent  enough to resolve the problems of the world today. You will never get anywhere with this. It is all a big joke. But, in the end, the joke will be on the politicians. You see, the Federal Reserve's dollar really is of no real value anyway. The fed has put America</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Energy prices are terribly high and that is uncalled for when we have resources in our own country available if we could lesson some of the ridiculous environmental laws that make it next to impossible to drill and refine our own oil. If we could use our own resources the price of crude oil should come down.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am retired and live alone, so my fuel needs are not great. I have children and grandchildren whose energy needs are great and the rising prices of food, health care, etc. make life difficult for them. They work hard and some have their own businesses and they have a hard time making ends meet.</narrative>
  <narrative>We need to make use of the nuclear resources that we already have in place in some areas of our state. Our population is growing and that brings a need for more energy for just living. We need a congress that will encourage not discourage the use of what we have while other sources of energy are being developed.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>I believe every Congressman should be tried for treason to this country who has not supported our energy independence!! They have taken an oath to support the constitution and defend the USA from all enemies foreign and domestic!!! We have lost our sovereignty to the foreign oil countries and the problem lies at the feet of Congress!!! In such a court for treason there would be some found not guilty but there would be many who would be found guilty and should be dealt with accordingly!! Yes we  need to protect our environment but if we go down as a sovereign nation, who in this world will take over our leadership on the issue of environment??? We have to get our oil and energy independence back so that we can lead the world in saving our environment!!! It is not just about money!!! It is about saving this sovereign nation!!!! Not only does our nation depend on it but all the nations of the free world depend on our survival.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>I often wonder whatever has become of Senators and Congressmen that love America beyond their own political gain? For years and years the Senate and the Congress have closed their eyes to passing bills that would have protected we Americans from the horrific gas prices we now face. This situation should never have happened! There is nothing that justifies this crisis!!! As the greatest nation on earth, we should not be dependent upon foreign oil We should never be dependent upon countries that  despise America. We have enough oil in this nation to care for our own people!</narrative>
  <narrative>How shameful what you Senators and Congressmen have done to us, the American people!!! Everyone is financially hurting. In our opinions, it is treason on your part! This situation is not going to get better until we drill here, drill now and pay less</narrative>
  <narrative>We are disappointed and ashamed of our Senators and Congressmen who sat by, and continue to sit by and allow this nation to suffer financially. Do your job or resign!</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>My husband has his own business and it is a small 2 man business but they are a valuable resource to our cities. They have a carpet/disaster and restoration company. They are always busy but because of the high price of everything especially gas it really makes it hard on them. They cannot raise their prices for fear of losing business but then again they have to pay the high price of gas to keep customers and keep them happy. It's a no win for them.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>As a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Idaho, I appreciate your call for suggestions. I have two children, 8 and 12 yrs of age--a boy and a girl. Some of the things that are affected are medical checkups that now go without being done, even with the ridiculous insurance coverage, and then entertainment. So with one big swoop, our lives have just changed in two dramatic ways, one essential at times, the other stress relief. Sad thing is I work in the oil and gas fields. I know that  animal rights activists are full of crap for the most part. I see life in the fields far better off than whatever they seem to see. (Or do not see). It is safer for wild animals than it ever has been, and I just do not see why we do not drill more. I am not a huge</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>As a small business owner (insurance agency), I have come to realize that this dependence on the present energy sources is not just an incapacitation to private concerns, but will ultimately translate into higher ins. premiums due to increased repair costs arising from parts manufacture costs, repair shop employee costs etc.. This crisis will reach into every avenue of our lives. At 56, I am trying to plan for retirement. I am a licensed securities advisor, and as such probably have better information  than most to help to arrive at a reasonable retirement income. However, my present plan, due to energy prices has become doubtful. If my situation is such, what of the common laborer? Will the gov't find themselves caring for the aged in an even bigger way than at present? Where will they get the funds with the increase of baby boomers and reduction of upcoming generations? The energy crisis will be a tremendous cost to our American way of life. I personally believe that all americans should be appraised of those in their voting district that do not support a more aggressive move into the future of energy independance. Perhaps those in elected offices</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

  <narrative>Sixteen years ago we moved 12 miles west of Blackfoot on a small acreage to raise our two daughters along with our dogs, cats, horses, and birds. Our oldest daughter has some learning disabilities and is now an active Special Olympics athlete. It was a long road to where she is today and that was an amazing journey. Not long after moving, through our church's children's ministry, we became aware of a great need for safe and nurturing homes for damaged children. We eventually adopted two boys  and it was a good thing we lived in the country because they liked to make noise. Some years later we started to take in foster children and have now had about 30 needy kids in our home (at different times I assure you). Early in that venture we developed a relationship with the Shoshone-Bannock people at Fort Hall and they have great needs for homes to take care of their damaged children. Many of our foster kids have been native children and we now have three for which the tribe has allowed us guardianship. These children are very needy and spend time daily with various therapists and the oldest went to a developmental</narrative>
  <narrative>We have entrusted you with representing our interests to the federal government so please evaluate this issue very carefully and  if you can find a sound moral and ethical way to help us continue our contribution to our community and our neighbors please strive for that.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thanks for your service.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>First it is nice to hear that the Senate is at least thinking about it but I have to say that if the Senate needs families to write a few paragraphs to explain what impact these conditions are placing on the American family then I am not sure the Senate is in touch with reality as they should be.</narrative>
  <narrative>I have worked hard all my life and have provided well for my family. I am very thankful for the opportunities given me. I know that with hard work, kindness for our fellow man we will continue to do well. However, these impacts will be negative in the long run. They are putting undue stress on my family, on my life and every discussion everyday is about these prices and the affects it has on every aspect of the economy. There will be less productivity, less education, more broken families due  to the financial stress and probably most important less faith in our system.</narrative>
  <narrative>The American public has a government in place that has become so out of touch with who it represents that I am not sure anything will or can be done. There is too much greed and dishonesty in our government system and those that lead this country are in it for their own prosperity and not the prosperity and best interests of the people. I feel the liberals only want power and control. And I am not sure what the Republicans represent anymore.</narrative>
  <narrative>These energy prices impact every aspect of our lives, security and well being. If our government will not do the right thing immediately then there will be ramifications beyond belief and for generations to come. I am sure you know this but I hope you do ..... Our forefathers would have never have let this happen. We would be totally independent of all foreign control. They would have known the liberty and safety of this country would be at jeopardy.</narrative>
  <narrative>Best Regards,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Today, I was in a grocery store where the fellow in line in front of me bought a small bag of tomatoes for $7.00. Tomatoes are not in season here, and have to be shipped from California. The clerk said we will no longer be able to buy Cyrus O'Leary pies, as the company is located in Spokane, almost 100 miles away, and they are no longer willing to deliver further than 30 miles. We are going to have to change our ways of living, buying more locally produced goods. There is great opportunity here  for new local businesses. People are going to have to once again learn how to eat the food that is in season. Maybe local butcher shops will once again thrive, and be able to compete with the giant slaughter houses. None of this local economic development will happen if we once again are able to buy cheap gas.</narrative>
  <narrative>I do not favor anything that will bring the price of gas down. Our own natural reserves of oil in the ground should be saved for future generations to be used in manufacturing and other basic industries, instead of being burned up in internal combustion machines. I agree with you wholeheartedly that we need to turn to nuclear (providing there is adequate resources of uranium) and other non oil energy sources, and end our dependence on oil. Without the pain involved in high oil prices, there will  not be the will to make this difficult transition. Please stop trying to extract the last drop of oil from the ground so we can have cheap gas, and start thinking about the future.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>This hits the nail on the head, Senator. Until we cut down on the long-range use of fuels in this country for private transportation, the costs will--most likely--continue to accumulate and even accelerate.</narrative>
  <narrative>We see it on the highway as semi after semi tools along burning more fuel that an equivalent freight train to handle the same load. Somehow we have to come to grips with this or we are going to find ourselves either walking, or starving, or both.</narrative>
  <narrative>We see it on the highways and bi-ways of this country as 4-wheelers burn up fuel for recreation that could be put to better use. And, if you so much as suggest this might be a waste of precious resources, your political career would be in jeopardy!</narrative>
  <narrative>I appreciate the positive steps that you have taken in regard to legislation. The solutions are going to be hard--drill for oil, conserve what we have, eliminate unnecessary trips and combine errands to save gas. And quit using gasoline for recreational uses. These are some of the first steps.</narrative>
  <narrative>But, ultimately, we are going to have to look deeply at the problem of public transportation in this country. People are too selfish and too intent on achieving their own ends to cooperate until the situation becomes dire.</narrative>
  <narrative>But I am sure you will agree that this attitude of "you will have to pry my dead hands off the steering wheel (or handlebars) to get me to stop my wasteful practices" will actually only cease when we run out of oil or can no longer afford it. And that will be too late to do anyone any good.</narrative>
  <narrative>Limited public transportation options mean that many of us do not have any choice but to keep driving and paying those ever-increasing prices for fuel</narrative>
