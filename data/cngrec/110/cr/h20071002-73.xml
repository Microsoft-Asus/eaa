  <narrative>HONORING OWSLEY BROWN -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11132]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to rise today in recognition of my good friend and a great citizen of my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, Owsley Brown II, as we mark the end of his 46-year career at Brown-Forman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Louisville, Owsley is well known for his success in business. He worked his way up to the top of his family business, and his leadership turned it into a giant in the wine and spirits industry. That fact is all the more astounding, considering that among the top companies in the industry 50 years ago, only his Brown-Forman remains a leader in the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The global expansion has taken the company to heights only dreamed of back then, and the branding under his watch was absolutely unprecedented. Jack Daniel's, a tiny acquisition of a half century ago, has practically superseded the term whisky itself. But in Kentucky, of course, we take the most pride in Brown-Forman's home-grown bourbons: Early Times, Old Forester and Woodford Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Owsley Brown's reputation in business comes not only from making money, but from creating an environment in which people want to work. Owsley himself takes great pride in the fact that the average tenure at Brown-Forman, 14 years, is three times the average for a Fortune 500 Company. The reason for this is simple. For many of these employees, Owsley Brown gave them more than a job; he gave them a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Owsley's place in our community only begins with what happens in the walls and barrels at Brown-Forman Corporation. Through the philanthropy of Brown-Forman, Owsley set the standard for what it means to be a good corporate citizen. His commitment to social responsibility can be seen throughout his work for the Century Council, of which Brown-Forman is a founding member, and in every facet of Louisville life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His dedication to the arts has been critical to Louisville's developing a scene in which music, theater, independent film and visual arts of every stripe have thrived, helping to forge our community's unique and exciting character. His philanthropic devotion to health care has helped make Louisville home to some of the best facilities, doctors, and medical innovation in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's more, as Owsley helped to make Louisville a vibrant 21st-century city, he never lost sight of the need to preserve Kentucky's natural beauty. In fact, he has served as a powerful force in protecting land from overdevelopment, particularly along Louisville's scenic riverfront. Long before conservation hit the mainstream, Brown-Forman began implementing policies to reduce the company's environmental footprint and enhance the environment around us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as Owsley took Brown-Forman to new heights worldwide, our community reaped the rewards. We are fortunate in Louisville, for even as a corporation sees its leader pass the torch into other capable hands, Mr. Brown remains one of our most generous and responsible citizens. His triumph and business exceeds the success of the bottom line. The true achievement he oversaw and engineered was creating a company of fine character and impeccable integrity, just like the man himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring my good friend, Owsley Brown, thanking him for all he has done and wishing him luck as he enters this next chapter of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Owsley, you and Christy now have time to see the world, and I have no doubt that you will use that time to change it.</paragraph>
