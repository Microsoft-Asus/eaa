  <speaking speaker="400060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, recently some Members of the House have proposed using the supplemental appropriations bill to restrict the President's ability to defend our country and its allies from a hostile Iran. Attempts to curtail the bargaining ability and leverage of the United States comes at the precise moment when our Nation must show strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, attempts to dampen our resolve and security send the anti-U.S. forces in Tehran a signal that America is weak. If Iran continues to see that America stands determined to prevent it from going nuclear, it will be encouraged to become a responsible member of the international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we falter, the Iranian nuclear threat may well become a reality. Mr. Speaker, we must not let that happen.</paragraph>
