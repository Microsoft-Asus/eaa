    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, more than 20,000 people descended on Washington today as part of the March for Life rally, marking the 34th anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 44 million children, little boys and little girls, their lives have been lost since 1973, at this origination of Roe v. Wade. They were never given the opportunity to enjoy life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one March for Life participant pointed out today: "Rain or shine, these unborn children don't have that option. They'll never be able to feel the rain on their heads. They'll never be able to feel the wind on their face. So this is a great opportunity for us to march in their honor." And these participants braved cold weather and lots of rain today to participate and stand up for the most vulnerable in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope for a more prosperous day when our country respects the lives of the unborn.</paragraph>
