    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to rise to honor a reporter's reporter, Mr. Jim Wensits, from the South Bend Tribune, who has recently retired. Jim is a proud graduate of Purdue University from 1966. Three days later, he started with the Tribune; and 40 years later he is retiring, after 20,000 articles and editorials. His hallmarks were integrity, accuracy, and fairness. His life's work made the South Bend Tribune a better paper and made our community a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on behalf of everyone back home, Jim, we want to say thank you. We wish Jim a great retirement with his family and with his beloved country music. Good luck, Godspeed, and thank you from everyone back home.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
