  <narrative>HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE STRENGTHENING THE CHIP AND CHAMP PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9188]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week the House will vote on the CHAMP Act, a bill that reauthorizes our Children's Health Insurance Program. This program will provide millions of children new health coverage and, through this program, protects Medicare for America's seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing the CHAMP Act will reauthorize the vital CHIP program, which is set to expire September 30 of this year. Currently 6 million vulnerable American children receive health care benefits through the CHIP. If CHIP did not exist, these millions of children would not have access to quality health care. The CHAMP Act also provides protection for our seniors. It ensures that they continue to have access to the doctors of their choice by stopping a 10 percent payment cut to the doctors and encourages  them to seek preventative health care benefits by eliminating copayments and deductibles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in one bill, this House is addressing the health care needs of our children and our seniors.</paragraph>
