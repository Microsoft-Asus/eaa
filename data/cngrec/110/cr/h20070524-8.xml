    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have served this Nation in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The first was a just war; the second was a tragic misadventure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 31 years of military service, I ran for this office. I have never deviated from believing that a date certain to redeploy from Iraq is the only strategy which can change the incentives for the Iraqis, the Iranians and Syria, to change their behavior and to work for a non-failed state in Iraq. But I have run the Navy $67-billion-a-year warfare program. And I understand that money is only so fungible, and we will run out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a greater good than me, than my office, than my caucus, than this Congress, and that is those that still wear the cloth of this Nation in Iraq that we Americans sent to fight for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot vote to place their security between us and someone we hope might blink, because I do believe, however, after this, that I have great faith that there are those Americans on both  sides of the aisle that will work towards ending this open-ended commitment for their security and America's.</paragraph>
