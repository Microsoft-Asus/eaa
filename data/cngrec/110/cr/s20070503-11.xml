    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize and congratulate the United Parcel Service on its 100th anniversary. In these 100 years, many of us have grown to see UPS's ubiquitous brown vans as symbols of reliability and to know and trust the remarkable people who drive them. As UPS has evolved to become the largest package delivery company in the world, it has become a cornerstone of commerce in America and a vital part of my State's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When James E. Casey founded UPS in 1907 with a $100 loan from a friend, surely it would have been beyond even his wildest dreams that the company would grow to deliver 15.6 million documents and packages every day, to employ 360,600 employees here in the United States, and to make deliveries to over 200 countries and territories throughout the world. By constantly innovating and improving service and  through the dedication of its employees, UPS has reached  the pinnacle of its industry and has set the standard by which its competitors must follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to say that since opening their first facility in Newark, NJ, in 1928, UPS has maintained a significant presence in my home State of New Jersey. It employs more than 18,000 people statewide, making it one of the 10 largest employers in our State. I recently had the privilege and opportunity to visit a UPS hub in Edison to help commemorate UPS's 100th anniversary. At the Edison facility, 3,000 dedicated employees process and sort packages originating from and destined for points all  over our State. Individuals and businesses across New Jersey rely on their efforts every day, and the intricate and sophisticated processes used by these employees ensure that important packages and documents are delivered on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating UPS on 100 years in business. I personally extend my best wishes to the company and its employees in New Jersey and across the world for many more years of success and prosperity.</paragraph>
