  <speaking speaker="400141" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the 35th anniversary of Roe versus Wade, and tonight I would like to recognize Congressman Chris Smith, who has been a committed champion to protect the unborn for as long as he has remained a Member of this body. So I yield now to Congressman Smith.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, 35 years after the infamous Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortion on demand throughout pregnancy, we mourn the estimated 50 million innocent girls and boys whose lives were cut off by abortion, a staggering loss of children's lives, equal to six times the total number of all people, young and old, living in my home State of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Someday, Mr. Speaker, future generations of Americans will look back on us and wonder how and why such a rich and seemingly enlightened society, so blessed and endowed with the capacity to protect and enhance vulnerable human life, could have instead so aggressively promoted death to children and the exploitation of women by abortion. They will note with keen sadness that some of our most prominent politicians and media icons often spoke of human and civil rights, while precluding virtually all  protection to the most persecuted minority in the world today: unborn children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Sunday, Senator Barak Obama criticized Americans for both our moral deficit and what he called our "empathy deficit" and called upon us to be our brothers' and sisters' keepers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Can Senator Obama not see, appreciate or understand that the abortion culture that he and others so assiduously promote lacks all empathy for unborn children, be they black, white, Latino or Asian, and is at best profoundly misguided when it comes to their mothers? Why does dismembering a child with sharp knives, pulverizing a child with powerful suction devices more powerful than 20 to 30 times the average cleaning machine, vacuum machine, or chemically poisoning a baby with any number  of toxic chemicals fail to elicit so much as a scintilla of empathy, moral outrage, mercy or compassion by America's liberal elite?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abortion destroys the very life of our "brothers and sisters," and the proabortion movement is the quintessential example of an "empathy deficit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to be blunt. Abortion is violence against children. It is extreme child abuse. To strip away the euphemism, it is cruelty to children. Sadly, abortion is not only legal until birth, but the daily perpetrators of this terrible injustice are massively subsidized by liberal politicians who enrich the abortion industry with taxpayer funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2008, the largest abortion provider in the Nation, Planned Parenthood, continued to receive huge amounts of taxpayer funds. Some time ago on the floor, Mr. Speaker, I asked Americans, I asked my colleagues, and suggested it was time to take a second look at Planned Parenthood, "Child Abuse, Incorporated." Every year they abort over 265,000 children in their clinics, a huge and staggering, stunning number of child deaths. And yet they get massive amounts of Federal funds and local funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are at least two victims in every abortion. It is time to recognize and accept the inconvenient truth that abortion exploits women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Alveda King, niece of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, has had two abortions. Today she has joined the growing coalition of women who deeply regret their abortions and are part of a group called Silent No More. Out of deep personal pain and compassion for others, they challenge us to respect, protect and tangibly love both mother and the child. The women of Silent No More give post-abortive women a safe place to grieve and a road map to reconciliation. And to society at large, these brave  women compel us to rethink and reassess the chief sophistry of the abortion culture. Reflecting on their famous uncle's speech, the "I Have a Dream" speech, Dr. Alveda King asks us, "How can the `Dream' survive if we murder the children?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, 35 years after Roe, the pro-life ranks today have swelled with abortion survivors, women who tell their stories with great bravery and candor. I remember hearing a woman right outside of the Supreme Court who, while she was actually getting the abortion, said to the doctor, she was only partially sedated, said, "It is trying to move." She said she wanted to get up off of that table and run out the door, and the nurses practically screamed at her and said, "It is too late. The abortion  is already underway." So many others who have actually seen the child after being aborted, very often they whisk the baby away so that there is no contact made, who then tell the story of the nightmares. Again, the Silent No More campaign helps these women reconnect and find reconciliation and hope for their shattered lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, at the March for Life, the ranks of the pro-life movement was filled with young people. I have gone to that march each year for 35 years. I have never seen more young people speaking out passionately, all ethnicities represented, young boys and young girls, teenagers and young adults, who say we are going to be, and are, the pro-life generation. And they have certainly reason to react that way. Every third member of their generation has died from abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, finally, I hope this Congress takes a long and hard second look at the glib euphemisms that are used to promote abortion, the marketing strategies, the polls that have driven this terrible issue forward, and strip it all away. Look at the deed itself: chemical poisoning, dismemberment, partial-birth abortion awakened at least some Members to the cruelty of abortion. Connect the dots. Every method is an act of violence. And again, there are two victims in every abortion, mother and  child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly believe that united in prayer, united in fasting, and with a lot of hard work, just like the abolitionists of old, who said that you cannot discount the humanity of people because of the color of their skin, well, the dependency or the immaturity of a child also should not become a disqualifier. America's dark night of child slaughter will some day, and some day soon, Mr. Speaker, come to an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back to Mr. Franks and thank him for his extraordinary leadership on this human rights issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield to Mr. Walberg.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and good friend from Arizona for the opportunity to speak tonight. I just came back from Iraq and Afghanistan this past week, and on the way back from Kabul to the airport, I looked out of our window of the vehicle we were riding in and I saw two young children running alongside the vehicle, as children will do, having fun together. They were racing each other and racing our vehicle. I looked in their eyes, and I saw nothing but what I would see  in normal little children's eyes having fun, except these two young children had smudged faces and tattered clothes that they were playing in, in a war zone. And I thought to myself, these two little children could be just like a number of children we have read about, through the barbarism of individuals for a particular philosophy would have ammunitions strapped to them, and then, in a barbaric, gruesome way, their lives taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this day, the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we live in a civilized country, well educated, cleaned up, sanitized, and yet, because of a lie, there are innocent women, and indeed birth fathers, as well, who are caught in a lie and a trap that causes them to, in a sanitized way to some degree, yet the ultimate outcome is the same, to snuff out innocent lives for no reason that justifies that taking place. Today marks the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Since that time, nearly 50 million  abortions have been performed. That is a staggering number which intensifies when we recognize each abortion consists of one innocent life snuffed out and at least one other life that is wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I respect the fact that others may disagree, I believe that human life begins at conception. That means that almost 50 million lives have been extinguished since 1973. Because of Roe v. Wade, we have learned that a reckless majority on the Supreme Court can visit untold destruction and pain on us as a Nation if they search for results in individual cases that are outside the scope and text of the history of the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have learned that the activist justices can find "penumbras, formed by emanations" in the Bill of Rights as a basis for establishing new constitutional rights that are not found anywhere in the text or history of the Constitution, as Justice Douglas ridiculously claimed in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, a precedent for Roe v. Wade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, unelected activist judges with lifetime appointments continue to make law rather than to apply the law as it is written. As elected officials, it is our right to make law, and it certainly is not the right of judges and justices to do so. Rather, they must follow the law as we, the accountable decision makers, have written it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have engaged in a long struggle and must continue in that struggle to ensure that the Supreme Court and our lower Federal courts are stocked with people who abide by the text and the history of the Constitution instead of acting as super-legislators in making new law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, on the 35th anniversary of that tragic ruling, my heart is grieved; yet, it is heartened. Though we mourn for lives that could have been, we see significant progress in the fight to defend human life. Just today, a bipartisan majority in the Michigan Senate voted to ban partial birth abortion. Abortions have declined by nearly 20 percent in the past 15 years, and every year Americans have become increasingly pro-life. I, along with millions of Americans, remain committed to  saving the unborn and upholding the right to life our Nation was founded upon. Perhaps the tide is finally turning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also call, Mr. Speaker, for an all-out effort of compassion for the women and the birth fathers who have been caught in the lie of abortion and have had their lives altered. A loving God offers forgiveness and hope and healing, and we, His people, can offer no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pledge to continue to work every day to bring back the sanctity of life to our Nation. And it is heartening to stand here with my colleagues tonight and with hundreds of thousands of individuals today on the Mall and speak for life.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400141" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for leading this hour and for allowing me to be with him tonight and for giving me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, know that my prior career, my profession before becoming a Member of Congress 5 1/2  years ago was I practiced medicine, and not just as a medical doctor, but as an OB/GYN specialist. In that specialty for 26 years, I delivered over 5,200 babies during that time. I am very proud to say that I performed no abortions. But I think it is important for our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, and for men and women across this country to understand how this Roe v. Wade came  about 35 years ago in 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to that, abortion in many States was illegal. It could not be performed. In some instances, yes, it was true that women would have what is known as a criminal abortion done, and sometimes with very devastating consequences to the woman. If the abortion was done by a doctor with skills, surgical skills, there probably were no complications, other than destroying that human life, that little human life. But if the abortion was performed in an unprofessional, botched manner, then the life  not only of the fetus but also of the woman was at stake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was an intern at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, back in those days in the late 1960s, 1969, 1970, yes, there occasionally was a patient on the ward suffering from septic shock. And in one instance I very vividly remember that that patient, that mother who had had an abortion done and the complications thereof, infection set in and she died. And these cases were presented across the country to the Supreme Court eventually, basically, in Roe v. Wade. And then all of a sudden  the Supreme Court said that no State, no State could proscribe abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we got to in 1973. And since that time, of course, as my colleague from Michigan just mentioned, something like 48 million lives have been destroyed in the abortion process, in that so-called safe, legal process, where the procedures are done by licensed physicians, and they are done under certain circumstances, maybe in a hospital with anesthesia, and it is very safe and that no mothers die.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, some mothers do die. But without question, some 48 million little children, potential Members of Congress in fact, lost their lives by this abortion procedure. And that is why I am so proud to be here tonight to join with my colleagues, with the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Smith, Mr. Franks, Mr. Davis, Mr. Walberg, Mr. Lamborn and others to talk about this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Each of us will have a little bit of time. But I am very grateful to be  standing here tonight to know that today on the Mall, right here at the Capitol, we had so many come. I don't know how many thousands of families came. We had something like 12 or 14 Members of Congress speak on behalf of life, the life of the infant, the life of the fetus. This is a very proud day, and it is a very proud evening too for us to stand here for the sanctity of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to focus on a couple of charts that I have got. The first one, if my colleagues will look, basically says this. This is a quote from a very important person, and I will mention her in just a minute. "Abortion, at any point, was wrong. It was so clear. Painfully clear." That ends the quote. This is from Norma McCorvey, better known as Jane Roe from Roe v. Wade. In other words, she was the plaintiff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. McCorvey wanted to have an abortion in a State that didn't allow it, so she was the plaintiff. This quote is taken from her book, "Won by Love" by Norma McCorvey, and she is now a pro-life advocate. She didn't have that abortion, because by the time Roe v. Wade was passed, she had gone on and had that little girl, who is in her mid-thirties now. Mrs. McCorvey, Norma, is also the proud grandmother of two children. Thank God that she didn't have that abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen to what Susan B. Anthony, this is way long, many years ago, in another century, said even before this issue came up. "Abortion is a reflection of our society's failure to meet the needs of women. We are dedicated to systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women to abortion." That is a quote from Susan B. Anthony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I want to point out is that many States now, many States, including my own State of Georgia, I am very proud that we have passed, as this poster shows, a "woman's right to know law," required not just in Georgia, but in 23 States, that women who seek abortions be fully informed about relevant issues such as, the first bullet point, medical risk of abortion; the possible detrimental psychological effects of an abortion; a father's legal responsibility in State laws for paternal child support;  and medical assistance benefits may be available to prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, that we just in the last month reauthorized for an additional 18 months, does include prenatal care so that women are not forced for financial reasons to terminate a pregnancy. So this is really what Susan B. Anthony was talking about so many years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are seeing as a result of that, in my last chart that I want to present, is that over these 35 years, we are seeing a gradual and actually dramatic drop in the number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. Those women who are most fertile, that peaked at 29 per 1,000 women that age back in 1979. Now the latest statistics in 2005, that number has dropped down to something like 19.4. So we are making great progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point that I want to make in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, is we don't need to continue to destroy life. We need to inform women. We need to inform women of their choices, the alternatives to destroying a human life, which in almost every instance they are opposed to. But they are uninformed, they are frightened, they are scared, they are concerned about raising a child as a single parent. But if they are given the opportunity maybe to place that child for adoption, if they know there is financial  help available, if they know that there are counselors who want to work with them that help them if they decide to have their baby and be a single parent, if that is the case, these are the things that we need to be concentrating on, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as I conclude, I just want to say to the gentleman from Arizona, I thank him for giving all of us an opportunity tonight to speak on this hugely important issue. Let's stand for the rights of the unborn. Let's not be so concerned about some person who is already here, man or woman, about their property rights guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. Let's think about what we said in our Declaration of Independence and think about unalienable rights, such as the right to life. Let's think about  what is in the Charter of the United Nations, that every member nation is bound to abide by, and that is the sanctity of life. And, last but not least, what God says in both the New and the Old Testament, thou shalt not kill; you shall not take another's life. That is why we stand here tonight, to bring that to our Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back to the gentleman from Arizona, and thank him for allowing me to be part of this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. David Davis.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Franks, thank you for your leadership on this very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To many of us across this great land of America, life is an emotional issue. To many of us, it is a Biblical issue. The Bible actually tells us that we are knit together in our mother's womb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's go back and just think about a day that we lost a lot of Americans. Let's go back to September 11th, 2001. If you are listening across this great land, just think back how you felt on September 11th when you learned that 3,000 Americans had been killed. Do you remember where you were? Do you remember how you felt? It was 3,000 Americans killed that day. I know exactly where I was and I know how I felt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, where were you on September 12th, September the 13th, September the 14th, September the 15th? Those days, almost 4,000 Americans were killed, and every day subsequent. We are losing Americans to the tune of almost 4,000 Americans a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ronald Reagan once said "abortion is only advocated by persons who have themselves been born." His pro-life position was not limited to the beginning of life issues, but extended all the way to natural death. It is clear that Reagan would have stood against pro-assisted suicide and euthanasia laws. In 1988, he declared "The right to life belongs equally to babies in the womb, babies born handicapped and the elderly and the infirm."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years since our Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade and declared abortion a constitutional right, the assault Mother Theresa rightly called the "war against the child" has claimed nearly 50 million Americans, 1.2 million every year, and, yes, almost 4,000 babies every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pro-life policies such as parental consent and waiting periods enjoy tremendous public support, 82 percent and 74 percent respectively. Washington, this Congress, should deny hundreds of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood and abortion centers that promote and perform abortions here and abroad. The unborn child has the right to life, and that right should not be taken away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Roe v. Wade was poorly conceived and morally wrong. This decision should be overturned. Life begins at conception. An unborn baby should share the birthright of all Americans, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back to the gentleman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his very moving words. I would now yield to Mr. Lamborn from Colorado.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412191" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for putting this time together and for recognizing me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today marks the 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion in the United States. Elective abortion, a tragic practice, is the most common medical procedure performed in the United States. Let me repeat: Abortion is the most common medical procedure performed in the United States, and is perpetuated by a perverse logic that the life of an unplanned child is somehow not of the same value as that of any other child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent study published by the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry in 2006 indicates that women who have had an abortion have a much higher incidence of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors and substance abuse. Abortion can also cause physical side effects, such as reduced fertility, hemorrhaging, and even death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize pregnancy care centers around the country, who defend the lives of the unborn and protect the physical and psychological health of American  women who find themselves in unplanned pregnancies every year. Through the support of selfless men and women devoted to a culture of life, these care centers are able to give concrete, practical assistance to women, from pregnancy testing to prenatal vitamins, ultrasound imaging and  infant supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, many women in the United States are told and believe abortion is the only way. Pregnancy care centers respect these women and their right to know that there are other options. These facilities offer guidance for mothers faced with heart-wrenching decisions. Whether the woman chooses to give the child up for adoption or raise the baby, pregnancy care centers provide counseling, information and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pregnancy care centers across the world have and will continue to reduce abortion rates, save unborn lives, and help women avoid the psychological and physical damages of abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, I mourn the 50 million American lives cut short by abortion, and pray that God continues to protect and strengthen those touched by this tragic practice. I will be among those working to end it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding. I also want to thank him for his extraordinary and compassionate and principled and eloquent advocacy of life. The people of Arizona who cherish life are extraordinarily well served by Mr. Franks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to this well having enjoyed a day, Mr. Speaker, on the National Mall, where over 100,000 Americans by some estimates gathered in the bitter cold 35 years after a Supreme Court decision, and they gathered for one reason and one reason only, because those Americans cherish the sanctity of life and are unwilling to go quietly into that good night, which is an America that walks away from a belief that every life is sacred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>100,000 people. Not at the podium. Not with the television cameras on them, as some of us were. Not with the accolades of people in a movement who will write on the Internet or write editorials how they approve of our stand. But in the obscurity of a throng of tens of thousands, Americans came. In the dead of winter. It was extraordinary, Mr. Speaker, I must say, and it gives me great hope about this movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sanctity of life is the central axiom of Western civilization. It is, I believe, our commitment to the unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness that split the atom of the American experiment and has created the freest and most prosperous and most powerful nation in the history of the world. It is because we embrace that ethic that we are endowed by our Creator with the unalienable right to life. And there, 35 years after Roe v. Wade, 100,000 Americans are still standing  in the cold for that principle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise tonight very humbled to hear the eloquence of my colleagues, but filled with hope after a hurried day in this movement, because I have seen the faces of the foot soldiers of the right to life. I have stood among a throng of young Americans, particularly young women under the age of 30, who are choosing life as never before. In the last 20 years, abortion has declined by more than 20 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I believe, as you could see in those relationships today on the National Mall, it's not just because of political debate, but it's because of moral persuasion. In the last 35 years, I believe in the quiet counsels between mothers and daughters, between grandmothers and granddaughters, the truth about abortion is being told.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Life is winning in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise tonight simply, Mr. Speaker, to speak a little out of turn, and not just to your chair, but maybe to those that are looking in tonight and to say thank you for standing for life. Your efforts on behalf of the unborn are not in vain, and I do believe in our lifetime, if we will exercise the faith and perseverance and compassion and civility that was in evidence on the National Mall today, we will see Roe v. Wade collapse like the Berlin Wall. It will collapse finally and at last on that  day when people on both sides of the debate don't want it there anymore.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Arizona for organizing this Special Order tonight on this day that culminates a long period of time here in Washington across America where we have gathered together to march and to speak and to appeal and to pray for the end of this holocaust of abortion in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have enjoyed those experiences that I have been able to share with my pro-life colleagues. As I went to the mass last night in the basilica and looked out across that sea of faces, more than 10,000 strong on the ground floor of that magnificent cathedral up on the hill in northeast Washington, realizing that there are 10,000 people in the main floor and another 5,000 in the basement, 15 to 16,000, many young people, who have done the pilgrimage from all across America, gotten on a bus and ridden  for hours, maybe 18 or 20 or more hours to get here. They will go to the service, and they came to the march, the march for life today on The Mall in the cold and in the drizzle. They got back on the bus, some of them without even getting a chance to get warm, and headed back to their homes again. Those are people with conviction. Those are people that understand the two simple and basic questions that are before us here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first question is, and so when I ask many high school students in public auditoriums, do you believe in the sanctity of life? Is human life sacred in all of its forms? Is the person sitting next to you, is their life sacred? Is your life sacred? And I get the answer, the universal answer is yes, yes from all of them. I have never had a dissenter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I asked them, there is only one other question you need to ask to determine your position on life, and that is, this sacred life, your life, the person sitting next to you, at what instant did that life begin?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that there is only one instant, and that is the instant of conception. But once a person understands and comes to a faithful conviction that human life is sacred, and it begins at the instant of conception, we also will never lose the debate, will never lose our conviction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would invite anyone in this Congress to come to this floor and debate me on those two points. I would like to have someone stand up and tell me their life began at some other instant than conception, but it will not happen, because they know that the minute, the instant that anybody over here takes a position other than this sacred life begins at the instant of conception, they have instantly lost the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the point that I think all Americans should understand. If they do, this Nation will one day put an end to Roe v. Wade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a Catholic, an active Catholic, and I understand the church's teachings on this. I wonder, sometimes about some of the active Catholics in this Congress that do not necessarily reflect the church's teachings. I would love to see, and I would call out an invitation next year for the special mass at the basilica, for the Speaker to join us there in our public prayer for those 50 million lives of those little babies, those little babies that will never have the opportunity to laugh, to love,  never be hugged at night, never be kissed at night, not a single night, 50 million babies, 50 million little empty pairs of shoes, 50 million empty baby cribs, 50 million toys never played with, 50 million children, innocent as could be, denied the right to life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reflect upon the appointments to the Supreme Court that the President made in this past term, two magnificent appointments to the Supreme Court, and that would be Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. We got a Supreme Court decision that upheld our ban on partial birth abortion finally, finally a measure that came from this Congress that was not denied by the Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I looked across the sea of faces that filled The Mall as far as the eye could see today by the tens of thousands, and perhaps by the hundreds of thousands, and reflected that they all came here to this city today because the Court injected themselves into a policy decision, not a constitutional decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Roe vs. Wade and Doe v. Bolten, both need to be ripped out and both need to be overturned. The two magnificent appointments to the Supreme Court that understand this Constitution to mean what it says and mean what it was understood when it was ratified by our Founders, those appointments are wonderful appointments that move us down the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Constitution will protect life; it will protect marriage. But we must have a Supreme Court that protects the Constitution, that does not amend it with their liberalism and their activism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the next two appointments to the Supreme Court will be more important than the last two. The next two appointments to the Supreme Court will determine whether we preserve and protect life and whether we preserve and protect marriage. Those two are transformational issues before this Congress. We must stand up for life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We said goodbye to the elegant statesman and the great lion for life, Henry Hyde, Chairman Henry Hyde. Many of us count him as a friend. I counted him as one of the honors of my life to be able to call him as a friend and someone whom I admired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The words on the program at Henry Hyde's funeral were a quote from him that say this: "When the time comes, as it surely will, when we face that awesome moment, the final judgment, I've often thought, as Fulton Sheen wrote, that it is a terrible moment of loneliness. You have no advocates. You are there alone standing before God, and a terror will rip through your soul like nothing you can imagine. But I really think that those in the pro-life movement will not be alone. I think there will be  a chorus of voices that have never been heard in this world but are heard beautifully and clearly in the next world, and they will plead for everyone who has been in this movement. They will say to God, 'Spare him because he loved us,' and God will look at you and say not 'Did you succeed?' but 'Did you try?"'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless his life and his effort, and may he save the lives of the unborn.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now, Mr. Speaker, yield to the distinguished gentleman, Congressman Jordan of Ohio.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412226" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his compassion and his commitment to protecting all life, defending those defenseless and his tireless work, and my colleagues as well, who understand that all life is sacred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, as other speakers have done, I want to thank those thousands of families, thousands of young people, thousands of Americans who gathered today in our Nation's Capital. They too understand that life is precious, life is special, life is sacred and it should be protected in all forms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really want to thank them for two things, and I said this today at the rally. First, I want to thank them for having the willingness to engage in the struggle. I learned a long time ago that nothing of meaning, nothing of significance happens by hanging out on the sidelines. You have got to be willing to get in the game step, you have got to be willing to get out of the shadows, step in the game if you are going to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what Americans were doing today here in our Nation's Capital. I also want to thank them for something else. One of the things that all of us as Members of Congress deal with are those interest groups, those lobbyists who want to come talk to us about all kinds of issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say this every chance I get to talk about the life issue. We have all kinds of lobbyists who want to come talk to us, then to talk to us and influence the way things work here in Congress, the way legislation is passed. The reason they want to talk to us is they and their clients have a financial interest at stake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the people who came to our Nation's Capital today, they had nothing to gain financially for doing what they did today. They simply did it because it was the right thing to do. They understand that the truth is the truth, and that life should be protected. I reassured them today. I think we are going to win.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It may take some time, but America always gets it right. Sometimes it takes us a while, but we get it right. We are making progress. We wish it would happen quicker. It has been 35 years now in this struggle. We wish it would happen quicker, but we are getting closer. Someday in this great country, the greatest Nation in history, we will get it right and every single human life will be protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said to many of the folks that I had an opportunity to speak with today, you know, stay positive, because in America things do work out and the truth does prevail in the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told them the story from scripture, and I will finish with this before I yield back to my old friend. The old story from scripture is so appropriate, I think, in that we should stay positive. The story goes, when the Israelites were camped against the Philistines, and every day the Philistine giant would walk out and issue the challenge, Who will fight Goliath? The Israelites' response was, He is so big we can never defeat him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But David's response was, He is so big I can't miss. That is the attitude we saw on display today in our Nation's Capital. That's the attitude that has always been a part of the American experience. That is the attitude we need as we go forward. We will win this effort and all life will be protected in this country because you have great people like Mr. Franks from Arizona. I appreciate his time tonight in scheduling this hour for us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Sali).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, gentlemen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to commemorate National Sanctity of Human Life Day. This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, that landmark decision that so drastically altered the landscape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month also bears a sad distinction. In January 2008, we passed the tragic mark of 50 million lives that have been lost to abortion since Roe vs. Wade. We cannot help but wonder about the implications of this astonishing statistic. We are all concerned about the shortage of workers in our country. So many of those unborn lives lost due to Roe v. Wade would now be in the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about Social Security? Could we not better sustain the vitality of the program if these same workers were paying into the system? These are matters of demographics and economics, yes, but ultimately they are about the most profound issue of all, the simple but indispensable sanctity of human life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this very room, from the view of the distinguished Speaker, the center of relief that looks over all of us is an image of Moses, the lawgiver. In the 90th Psalm, Moses wrote "Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom ..... May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How many of our children will never be able to number their days because their days will never begin? How many will never know God's splendor in the life He wants for each of us, because they never have been allowed to see the light of day?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the father of six and the grandfather of six, five of whom have been born and one who remains unborn, yes, a grandfather of six, I have watched the breathtaking miracle of life unfold again and again. Every time I see a small child, I am reminded of the wondrous blessings of a creator who allows us to share in the miracle of creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of the poet William Wordsworth, "Heaven lies about us in our infancy." It is essential for all of us to remember that in any abortion there are two victims, the mother and the unborn child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have to do a better job of communicating to women in crisis what public and private resources are available to help them, to reach out more vigilantly to these women with a tenderness and a practical compassion our country has shown so often to so many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the selfless unsung sacrifices of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens who care for women with crisis pregnancies and to provide spiritual, emotional and material support for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that we recall the words of our Declaration of Independence, that our creator has endowed all with certain unalienable rights, the first of which is life. The little one in the womb is a person with value independent of his or her mother and deserves the right to that life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members of Congress, we are uniquely positioned to protect the most innocent and vulnerable members of our society, the unborn. If we cannot protect the most innocent and helpless among us, how can we proclaim that we want to provide justice and protection for anyone else?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>May those of us who believe in the uniqueness of human personhood, from conception to death, today again resolve never to cease our efforts to make our beloved country not only a beacon of hope but a sanctuary of human dignity. Surely there can be no higher calling for us as public servants of this blessed land.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400141" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, because the end of the hour grows close, I would now come before this body with a sunset memorial. We intend to repeat this from time to time to chronicle the loss of life by abortion on demand in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is January 22, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand just today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exactly 35 years today, the tragic judicial fiat called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million children. Mr. Speaker, that is more than 16,000 times the number of innocent lives lost on September 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of the 4,000 children that we lost today had at least four things in common. They were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. And each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each of their mothers, whether she realizes it immediately or not, will never be the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, those noble heroes lying in frozen silence out in Arlington National Cemetery did not die so America could shred her own Constitution, as well as her own children, by the millions. It seems that we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the genocidal crimes of past generations, those who allowed their courts to strip the black man and the Jew of their constitutional personhood, and then proceeded to murderously desecrate millions of these, God's own children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to blindness and invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date, those yet unborn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas Jefferson said, "The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath. The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says: "No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the Declaration, not the casual notion, but the Declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet today, Mr. Speaker, in this body we fail to honor that commitment. We fail our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 innocent American babies who died without the protection we should have been given them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so for them in this moment, Mr. Speaker, without yielding my time, I would invite anyone inclined to join me for a moment of silence on their behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe that this discussion tonight presents this Congress and the American people with two destiny questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first that all of us must ask ourselves is very simple: Does abortion really kill a baby? If the answer to that question is "yes," there is a second destiny question that inevitably follows. And it is this, Mr. Speaker: Will we allow ourselves to be dragged by those who have lost their way into a darkness where the light of human compassion has gone out and the predatory survival of the fittest prevails over humanity? Or will America embrace her destiny to lead the world to cherish and  honor the God-given miracle of each human life?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been said that every baby comes with a message, that God has not yet despaired of mankind. And I mourn that those 4,000 messages sent to us today will never be heard. Mr. Speaker, I also have not yet despaired. Because tonight maybe someone new, maybe even someone in this Congress, who heard this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill a baby, that it hurts mothers more than anyone else, and that nearly 50 million dead children in America is enough.  And that America is great enough to find a better way than abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are numbered and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on another day yet to come, may that be the day that we hear the cries of the unborn at last. May that be the day we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a sunset memorial, Mr. Speaker. It is January 22, 2008, in the land of free and the home of the brave.</paragraph>
