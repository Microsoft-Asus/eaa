  <narrative>EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS -- (Senate - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5675">S5675</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300081" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance of extending unemployment insurance benefits to workers whose regular benefits ran out before they could get a new job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know, the labor market is weak. The unemployment rate has jumped to 5.5 percent in April from 5 percent in March. That is an extraordinary jump. This is the largest single month spike in 22 years and the highest level in 3.5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Labor Department's alternative unemployment rate, a measure that includes people who want to work but who are discouraged from actively seeking employment because they cannot find full-time jobs, reached 9.7 percent in May. This latter statistic might be more accurate with what has actually happened in neighborhoods across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Rhode Islanders, the situation is among the worst in the Nation. The number of unemployed Rhode Islanders has risen to approximately 35,000, which has been trending upward and is the highest since June 1994. Indeed, 6.1 percent are jobless right now, a figure which has remained unchanged over the past 2 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the fourth highest unemployment rate in the United States, and the highest rate in Rhode Island since August 1995, more than 12 years ago. It is also critical to point out that almost half, 41 percent of Rhode Islanders unemployed in January, February and March, exhausted their benefits, which is more than any other State in New England. Unfortunately, other economic indicators are equally discouraging. Economists think inflation is here to stay, and it is likely to get worse. We have  received a very poor inflation number this morning which suggests that the forecasts of economists are sadly becoming true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food prices are high. Consumers are able to afford fewer groceries at the supermarket and restaurants are being squeezed by food costs. Food prices across the country spiked by more than 4 percent in 2007, the biggest jump in 17 years, and they are expected to escalate another 6 percent this year, though some items, including eggs and milk, have gone up much more. So we are not talking about luxury items, we are talking about the basics to survive. They are getting more and more expensive as  more and more people are not able to find adequate work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of gasoline has risen 35 percent from a year ago, when it averaged approximately $3. In Rhode Island, it now costs $4.11, on average, for a gallon of regular unleaded, making it very difficult for working families simply to get to school, to get to their job, and to get around the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gross domestic product, the Nation's total output of goods and services, the measure of the overall economic activity of the country, increased at a mere .9 percent in the first quarter of 2008, which is nearly the same as the fourth quarter of last year. This stagnant growth obviously is highly correlated with the rising unemployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April, consumer credit borrowing rose $8.9 billion for the month to $2.56 trillion. This is significantly higher than economists forecast. This means increasingly that Americans are going to their credit cards to get by, and this is a timebomb ready to explode in our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More American families are being overwhelmed by debt. More and more families are forced, because they do not have adequate jobs, adequate wages to face the rising cost of gasoline and food, to take out the plastic. That can only last a certain amount of time. This is a looming problem that we have to recognize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, there is speculation that the impact of the foreclosure crisis will continue to spread. In my home State of Rhode Island, we have the highest foreclosure rate in New England. And the outlook is just as bleak. A recent Credit Suisse report noted that foreclosures could impact about 6.5 million loans by 2012, meaning that nearly 13 percent of residential borrowers could be put out of their homes; 13 percent of homeowners in America are facing the prospect within the next few years of  losing their homes. That is a startling and unacceptable projection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that the economic situation is significantly harsher now than the start of the last recession, the need to extend unemployment benefits is clear. In doing so, we can start to stimulate the economy. We have virtually no growth, we have a foreclosure crisis with escalating gasoline and food prices. If we want to get this country moving again, we have got to stimulate the economy. We tried with the rebates a few months ago; that has not proved effective. Unemployment insurance  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="5676">S5676</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individuals receiving these benefits are going to go right to the store, they are going to fuel their cars, they are going to buy food, they are going to try to take care of their children. This money is going right back in the economy. It is going to stimulate 64 cents more than we invest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that the administration has released a Statement of Administration Policy stating that it strongly opposes the bipartisan measure overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that the minority is unwilling to enact this meaningful legislation before us today. This would make a positive difference for America. I think it is reckless and irresponsible. Unfortunately, it is characteristic of this administration that they would oppose unemployment benefits for Americans while they continue to exhort us to spend billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The contrast could not be more stark and, I think, more condemning of this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we have to pass this legislation. We have to face it. And for my constituents in Rhode Island, it would be extremely useful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Center for Budget Policy Priorities, we have done this, we have extended benefits seven times over the past half century. They have provided much needed relief to workers. This is not something novel and unique. This is something we have done and we should do. We cannot afford to delay extending these benefits any longer. People are struggling throughout this Nation. It is our responsibility to respond to their needs, to give them a chance, to keep them afloat in a very stormy  economic sea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the immediate passage of these unemployment benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I too rise to support extension in unemployment benefits, and express the profound regret I and so many others, not only in this Chamber but throughout America, are having that our minority colleagues blocked the attempt to move this bill forward this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two reasons to do this. One is the individual and the humane, to help the people who need help. Of course, that is first and foremost. But the second is to give a real shot in the arm to the economy. There is no better way when an economy is in recession, going slow, to give it a shot in the arm than unemployment benefits. They are better than tax cuts, better than any long-term spending program. The economists have shown that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to say  no to just about everything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sad status quo is not very good. Look at the number of jobs this economy has lost this year: 324,000. That is probably 1 million people, given that so many of them are family members and breadwinners; 1 million people who had jobs or had loved ones who had jobs last year and don't have them today. We refuse to give them the barest of lifelines, an extension of unemployment insurance? That is disgraceful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk about who these people are because each one is an individual. How about Vincent DiRoma, former senior engineer for Kodak? Not only does he have a wife and three children, he also supports his elderly mother who relies on Social Security to get by. Vincent is currently training for a new career. We all know Kodak has laid off thousands and thousands in the Rochester area, highly qualified people, people with tremendous work ethic who don't want to or can't leave the Rochester area.  Vincent is now training for a new career. He is the kind of American we all appreciate. He is not sitting down and cursing the darkness. He is trying to make his situation better. His old job doesn't exist. An extension of his unemployment insurance will allow him time to complete the training and find a new job to support his extended family which, including himself, is six people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we telling Vincent DiRoma no? Why are we telling the other hundreds of thousands like Vincent no? That is so important. Again, we just block it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Economists, liberal and conservative, will tell us, when an economy is teetering on the edge of a recession, or, as many of us think, in recession, the best way to get money into that economy is unemployment benefits. The people who get them spend it. A tax cut is often saved. That is not a bad thing, but it doesn't mainline money into the economy the way unemployment benefits do. The money is sent out quickly. There is an existing system so we don't have to set up a whole new program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, there have been bipartisan moves to extend unemployment insurance when the economy heads south. Only in this new Congress--this "no, no, no" Congress, where Republicans block everything almost instinctively, atavistically--do we not get this kind of extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, there is an attempt to put this in the supplemental bill. We will try to do that, but it should pass like that. There should not be a single opponent to Vincent DiRoma and the other 323,999 people and families who have lost their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the sake of humanity, those who are unemployed such as Vincent and need the help, and for the sake of our economy, I urge colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider. Again, there is no better way--none--to get the economy moving than an extension of unemployment benefits. It is something we should move to quickly, without partisan wrangling, without ideological preconception. We should just move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, after 7 long years of the Bush administration, our country's economy is in the worst condition it has been in decades. In my State of Rhode Island this week, a gallon of gas cost $4.11. Grocery bills are up. Utility bills are up. Affordable housing is scarce. Many homes are in foreclosure. Health care costs remain high. As a blistering hot summer approaches, there seems to be no end in sight. These are difficult times for many families. But for millions of Americans  who are looking for a job today, the challenges seem almost insurmountable. Today, Senate Republicans showed yet again that they are more loyal to the failed economic policies of President Bush than to Americans who right now need our help. Majority Leader Reid</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Rhode Island, things were a bit worse. Last month the unemployment rate in our ocean State exceeded 6 percent. That is one of the highest in the country. These men and women are being forced to deal with both the deep disappointment of losing their jobs and the challenge of trying to make ends meet for their families in an economy that is in recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of these people is Brian Perry. Brian lives in East Providence, RI. He wrote me earlier this month to ask about the possibility of extending unemployment benefits. Brian had been a law clerk at a firm in downtown Providence, but he has been unemployed since January 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since January 11, he has applied unsuccessfully for more than 65 jobs. One of those positions had more than 300 applicants. Brian is receiving unemployment insurance, but it is not enough. Because he couldn't afford to pay both his mortgage and his monthly COBRA payments, Brian has been without health insurance since the end of January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the United States of America, a working man trying to find a job without health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says it has become more and more difficult just to afford groceries, and some nights he goes to bed hungry. He could go to a food pantry, of course, but he has not yet because he thinks there are too many people who are worse off than he is. Brian's unemployment benefits expire at the end of July.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People such as Brian need our help, and they need it now. What are we here for, if not to help our fellow Americans at times such as this? The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act would help. It would temporarily extend unemployment benefits  13 weeks beyond the ordinary 26-week eligibility period. In States such as Rhode Island, where people have been hardest hit, jobless workers would receive an additional 13 weeks of unemployment compensation.  This critical measure was modeled after a bill introduced in January by Senator Ted Kennedy, a true champion of working Americans. It passed the House of Representatives last week with a strong bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, unemployment insurance is just that--insurance. Millions of Americans go out pounding the pavement each and every day looking for work to support themselves and their families. They find work, they work hard, and they earn their paychecks. As part of an employee's compensation, employers pay into the unemployment insurance system so that workers will be covered if they lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Unemployment benefits help hard-working men and women in  this terrible Bush economy cover bills and living expenses while they search for a new job. The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act could help over 3 million Americans pay the mortgage or the rent or feed their families, as they continue to navigate a perilous job market. In Rhode Island alone, there are more than 18,000 people in need of a job, and their benefits either already have or will soon run out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard the argument that people would not be motivated to find work if we extend this benefit; that they need this little spur to get off the couch and out into the workforce. In my experience, this is a ridiculous argument, a demeaning argument, one that is completely disengaged from the day-to-day experience of regular Rhode Islanders, from ordinary Americans, a true beltway special of an argument. This is a hard-working country, and it is in tough economic times. Good people are hurting.  We should gather together around this legislation, support them as they try to get back into the workforce, and pass this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
