I am very proud of its accomplishments, and I would like to commend all of the people involved in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Audrey Nelson Community Development Award is presented by the  National Community Development Association in recognition of outstanding achievements and exemplary uses of the community development block grant funds. In the spirit of this program, which assists the needs of low-income families and neighborhoods, the city of Valdosta has set a goal of eliminating substandard housing by the year 2010.</paragraph>
