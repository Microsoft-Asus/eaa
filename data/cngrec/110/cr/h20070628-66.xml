  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate this and I appreciate the minority leader asking me to lead this hour tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to have next to me here a little poster that I'm going to keep up during my talk. I am joined by a couple of my colleagues that I will recognize in just a few minutes. I have been blessed to be a part of an organization and a group that has come here on the House floor in the last 18 months or so called the Truth Squad, led very ably by our colleague, Dr. Price from Georgia. I think that we will add to our Truth Squad on a regular basis the group that will be talking about  the House Democrats' Top 100 Broken Promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last fall, the Democrats won a majority in this Congress, in the House and in the Senate, by making many promises to the American people. They have not kept these promises. At the beginning of the 110th Congress, the new majority came to power full of promises for a bipartisan working relationship and a landmark pledge to create "the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history." Unfortunately, the first 6 months of Democratic control have been marked by a long string of broken  promises. Contrary to the pledges they made to the American people, the leaders of the current majority have delivered a more closed, intellectually dishonest, and ethically ambivalent House of Representatives. By decree instead of open debate, Democrats have attempted to weaken our national defense and legislate retreat from the global war on terror, impose the largest tax increase in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am quoting from a new report that the offices of the Republican leaders have put together and will continue to do that throughout my comments tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the 6-month mark of the new majority, the report takes a look at the House Democrats' top 100 promises and how those broken promises have led to little if any accomplishments of note and a record of failure that has undermined the confidence of the American people in this Congress. As I said earlier, this report complements efforts that have been made by other House Republicans, including the Official Truth Squad, and the Truth Squad has been holding Democrats accountable for their promises.  We're going to go over these promises one by one, point them out to the American people and show them what has not happened even though the Democrats made these promises in order to get elected last fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me start with Democratic Promise No. 1: Prepared to Govern and Ready to Lead: "Democrats are prepared to govern and ready to lead." Speaker-Elect Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, in a press release, November 8, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me tell you what the report is on that promise from the Chicago Tribune. The headline on the article, "Democrats Promised Way More Than They've Delivered So Far." June 21, 2007. And this is the quote from that article: "Six months after taking over Congress, Democrats find they have accomplished little of their agenda. Perhaps not coincidentally, Congress's job approval rating has reached a dramatic low. If they can't reverse the trend, some Democrats are starting to worry their majority  could be short-lived."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, for the benefit of the American people who counted on the promises that the Democrats made and who promised a new bipartisan approach to governing, and with our assistance we could have accomplished a great deal in this 6 months, but because they have refused to uphold their promises, they have not been able to fulfill much, if anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now like to recognize one of my colleagues who's here with us tonight who's going to expand upon some of these promises and talk a little bit about how they have affected the American people and perhaps particularly those in her district, the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Americans are disappointed. I think with the change in leadership in the House of Representatives as well as in the Senate, the people thought things were going to be improved. Kind of like when you buy a new container of detergent, it might say New and Improved. Well, I have to say, it's not improved and it certainly isn't new.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were promised transparency. As you know, the gentlelady from North Carolina, if you recall, we had some language about making all earmarks transparent when we were in charge, when the Republicans were in charge. Well, a week and a half ago on this very floor, we found out that that promise of transparency was broken and the promise of transparency in earmarks just didn't happen. As a matter of fact, we were going to be asked to vote on a bill that we had no idea what the earmarks were going to be in. We would be told that when it came back  from conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that clearly, as my momma used to say, was buying a pig in a poke. You didn't know what you were getting and it was a very bad public policy. One of the Democrat promises was that they were going to promote smart and tough security. Let me read a direct quote: "Democrats are committed to protecting our country with real security initiatives that are smart and tough," then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a press release on October 25, 2006, before the November elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, what we find is that the Democrats brought legislation to the House floor supporting the transfer of responsibility for a critical national security program to, of all entities, the United  Nations. And then 230 Democrats voted against a Republican motion to recommit which would have prohibited this transfer of responsibility and made clear that America's national security is and should be the responsibility of America alone. That happened to be  a vote on January 4 of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Fifth Congressional District in Florida, which I represent, and I know, Ms. Foxx, in your district, too, protecting of our borders is so important. Let me read a quote from then Minority Whip STENY HOYER. The quote was made November 25, 2006: "I believe there is virtually unanimous agreement in the Congress that we must secure our borders and know who is entering our country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrast that with May of 2006, and then what we have is a total change on June 15, 2007, when, just 6 months after the Democrats took power in the House, 214 Democrats voted against a Republican proposal to provide funds necessary for the construction of at least two layers of reinforced fencing, the installation of additional and physical barriers, road lighting, cameras and sensors, so that we could make our borders secure. This certainly is not the secure U.S. border promise that was made  before the election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fifth Congressional District has a large number of retirees in it and people who are relying on Social Security. They truly care about the future of our country and the absolute need to be very careful about protecting future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read a quote that was made and that is that they were going to reform entitlement spending to protect future generations. But here's where the broken promise came in. The Democrat budget actually puts off tough and divisive decisions. Democrats did not include proposals to control the growth of entitlement programs that are projected to swamp the rest of the budget. Again, another broken promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While you have a list there of 100 broken promises, whether it's the transparency issue or whether it is reforming entitlement spending, or let me end with one that is so important to my district and that is Social Security and the Social Security trust fund. I would like to read a quote, and this was in March 2007 by a member of the Democrat Party from New Jersey. He said, "We will not borrow the money from the Social Security trust fund and from other creditors around the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, when there was a Republican proposal to prohibit increases in the authorization spending levels if the Social Security surplus has been spent the previous year, that same Member from New Jersey voted to virtually break his promise. That's what Americans are concerned about. That's exactly why the rating of Congress is down to 14. I think it's a combination of thus far the very, very serious broken promises and what the Senate was about to do on immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Americans are very disappointed, and I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for bringing this issue to the House floor. It's important that we remind the citizens, Republicans, Democrats and Independents of the broken promises that have only happened the first 6 months of the Democrat control of this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for bringing this very important issue up.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Florida, who also represents a fifth district, as I represent the Fifth District in North Carolina. We share our names together and the districts that we represent, and our respective States together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to speak a little bit more from this report, and then I am going to recognize one of my colleagues from Texas. I think it's important to sort of set the stage again for these comments. I am very grateful to my two colleagues for being with me tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democratic Promise No. 2, now, as my colleague from Florida said, there are a lot more than 100 of these promises. We have taken the Top 100. Between now and the next 6 months, we know there are going to be a lot more than that, but we only have time to deal with the first 100.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this was Democratic Promise No. 2 that I want to highlight, "We will make this the most honest, ethical and open Congress in history," Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi, press conference, November 8, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promises, this is a quote from the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial, June 10, 2007, entitled, "A Wake-Up Call for Congress. When Democrats recaptured the House last November after 12 years of the minority, they promised voters `the most honest, the most open and most ethical Congress.' Five months after Nancy Pelosi and her leadership took control, that promise remains unfulfilled."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With so little in the way of accomplishments, is it any wonder that a new poll released by Gallup last week showed that just 14 percent of Americans have confidence in this Congress, an all-time low. The previous low point for Congress was 18 percent at several points in the time period from 1991 to 1994, the last time Democrats were in power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, one of the only meaningful accomplishments of this Congress to date has been legislation enacted to fully fund American troops fighting the war on terror, a bill that was carried on the strength of a unified Republican Party. Nearly half of the 39 bills signed into law either named Federal property or billed a road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sharp contrast, Republicans have spoken with one voice and kept our promise made to the American people 6 months ago to return to our core principles and focus on a smaller, less costly, accountable government. Moreover, a unified Republican Conference has proven formidable, effective and successful in exposing flaws and strengthening Democratic legislation by passing 14 GOP motions to recommit in just 6 months, more than House Democrats were able to accomplish in their 12-year stint in the  minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, the new Democratic majority has simply picked up where the old Democratic majority left off, a long list of broken promises, little in the way of accomplishments, and dangerously disconnected from the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to Congress because I wanted to make changes in a positive way and represent the people of my district and the country in a very, very positive way. I think most Members came here for that. It troubles me to see an approval rating of only 14 percent. That is not good for this institution; it is not good for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want us to be able to revive the attitude of the American people toward the Congress. That is why we are holding up these promises that the Democrats have made and not fulfilled that let people know the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now like to recognize my good colleague from the State of Texas (Mr. Carter), who is going to share some more insights into these broken promises.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend and colleague from North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an interesting document that we have got here. I have got a copy, certainly a smaller version than is on the board there. These Top 100 broken promises, I thought it would just be interesting to just thumb through here and turn to a page and see if we can find one that we might find interesting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am just going to randomly look here. Let's see, energy policy, Energy Independence Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promise: "We will make this 4th of July Energy Independence Day." That's coming up next week, I believe. That's from Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi back on May 9, 2007, at a press conference. "The House energy bill has evolved into a heated internecine battle" that threatens to spoil Democrats' hope of passing an overall energy policy by July 4. "Pelosi versus Dingell Heats Up."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Energy Tension Rises At Meeting," Roll Call, one of our newspapers here on the Hill, June 13, 2007. "House Members will depart for the 4th of July district work period without passing independence energy legislation of any kind." That's a quick look through here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look over here at something else. "Eliminate Reliance on Foreign Oil," promise: "To free America from dependence on foreign oil, we will achieve energy independence for America by 2020 by eliminating reliance on oil from the Middle East and other unstable regions of the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Nancy Pelosi, A New Direction for America," her speech, page 6. "During the first 6 months of the Democrat- controlled Congress, no energy independence legislation has been passed by the House, much less sent to the President's desk. But 228 Democrats voted to impose more than $6.5 billion in new taxes on small and independent American energy producers, which will lead to less domestic supply, higher prices for consumers, and an increase  in America's dependence on foreign sources." That's also from Roll Call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's turn over here a couple of more pages and look at what we can find.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Probably one of the things that Americans worry about most is their security for their families and their that children. You know, we don't ever want the United States of America to have to suffer the kind of terrorist activity that our friends in Israel suffer where, when you send your kids to the park to play ball or just swing or just visit with their friends, there is some idiot that wants to blow you up and kill you. We don't want that in this country. Homeland Security is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats, when they ran the last election, they made promises that they would implement all of the 9/11 Commission report. That was kind of their campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"On the first day we control Congress, we will begin by passing all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations," that's what the then minority leader Nancy Pelosi promised in the last election cycle campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another part of that promise, "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she plans to pass all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations within 100 legislative hours of a Democrat takeover of the House of Representatives." That comes from Congressional Quarterly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, now, I am afraid that promise got broken. Let's see what they actually did here. "But the 9/11 package will not include a reorganization of congressional oversight of Homeland Security Department or an attempt to declassify the intelligence budget, despite the fact that those two were key recommendations. Although the Democrats pledged during the election to implement all of the Commission's unfulfilled recommendations, aides now concede that doing so will be harder than they thought,"  Congressional Daily, December 15, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Pass clean spending bills without Iraq policy changes. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member John Murtha, Democrat from Pennsylvania, told reporters last week that he would not use the spending bills to enact policy on Iraq, a war he strongly opposes." That's from Congressional Daily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we have "A Broken Promise." An editorial in the Arkansas Democrat Gazette accused Democrats of using the supplemental spending bill to author resolutions that would severely restrict supplies and reinforcements for American troops in harm's way and would tie the President's hands by imposing all kinds of conditions on his ability to reinforce the troops. It comes from the Arkansas Democrat Gazette editorial, February 21, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CNN John Roberts questioned JOHN MURTHA, Democrat from Pennsylvania, about his slow-bleed scheme to undermine our generals and our troops on the ground on the American Morning, CNN, April, 2007. Mr. Roberts asked "You heard what President Bush said, that Congress shouldn't be micromanaging the war. What do you say?" JOHN MURTHA, "That's our job, John."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the upcoming Department of Defense spending bill, it's clear that House Democrats and Representative Murtha do intend to attach to the latest version of his slow-bleed scheme to undermine our troops. House Democrat leaders are considering votes next month on another legislative package aimed at changing course in Iraq and might announce those plans this week," said aides Monday. "The Iraq language would be an attached to the Defense Appropriations bill." This was June 26, 2007,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's thumb over here just a little bit more and see what we can do. Something that--I just heard a lecture this morning by an expert from over at Georgetown University on international terrorism, where he told us in an hour-long lecture that the resources that we have on the ground, and the intelligence community and the special operations forces that operate are critical in being able to bring down al Qaeda, which is a world-wide network, and, quite frankly, very, very much still alive in countries  like England and Western Europe, and their number one target is still to attack the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He stressed that we have got to have intelligence at every level assisting us in finding these people. I think this was recognized when we started this session of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is a promise, "We all, Democrats and Republicans alike, take very seriously our responsibility to protect the American people. We know the important role that intelligence plays in that."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another bill, another promise, "This bill contains robust funding for critical intelligence programs." The first quote was from Nancy Pelosi. This is from SILVESTRE REYES, chairman of the Intelligence Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is the broken promise. "Democrats pledge to provide full funding for critical intelligence programs. But just months after taking power, they took precious resources away from critical intelligence programs and used the money to fund research on global warming instead. Led by U.S. Representative SILVESTRE REYES of Texas, a coalition of D.C. Democrats say national security will be better served if the CIA cash is used for global warming research, because apparently there just  aren't enough people studying this issue out there." This is from an article that says Intelligence Committee Threatens National Committee, Detroit News editorial, May 13, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can move on. This is fun. You just turn to a page and see what we have got here. I welcome anybody to come turn the page for me. I am not making these things up here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Reform Entitlement Spending to Protect Future Generations. This summer, Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman said the administration would return to entitlements and taxes in earnest following the elections. Senior Democrats on the House and Senate Budget Committees, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, and Representative John Spratt of South Carolina, responded by saying Congress, not the administration, must drive these efforts." That's from The Hill newspaper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But the broken promises, but the Democrat budget plan puts off tough and divisive decisions. Democrats did not include proposals to control growth and entitlement programs that are projected to swamp the rest of the budget in coming decades as the baby boom generation retires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That comes from Congressional Quarterly March 29, 2007. Democrat budget does nothing to curtail runaway entitlement spending, Tallahassee Democrat editorial April 16, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we've just got promise after promise after promise. And as my colleague from North Carolina pointed out to us tonight, we've got an approval rating of this Congress at 14 percent, the lowest in the history of the United States Congress, by my understanding. The last time we were close to this low was back when the Democrats were last in power back just before 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a sacred body here. And it's important to win elections, and people use a lot of tools to win elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But back where I come from, and where a lot of the folks around here come from, when you tell somebody you're going to do something, you ought to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I once had a man tell me, if you ever serve in a legislative body, the greatest tool you take to that body is your word. And if you give somebody your word, you ought to keep it. And if you don't keep it, you ought to go home. And that's a man named Bob Johnson, who there now is an office building in the Capitol complex in Austin, Texas named after this great Texan. That is great advice. And that's why these broken promises, I think, should weigh upon all of us because, quite frankly, a man or  a woman's word ought to be their bond. And if you say you're going to do something, you ought to do it, and if you can't do it, you ought to at least try. And if you're not going to try, then you've broken your promise. And that's really not what this House ought to be all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there's a lot of campaign rhetoric, but a lot of these things were not said in campaign and, in fact, many of them were said right on the floor of this House as a pledge to the colleagues in this House. These pledges shouldn't be broken. We have a duty to raise the level of honor that it now seems to be the American people seem to be perceived is lost in this House of Representatives. I hope we can all take my friend Bob Johnson, who's now passed away, his advice. Let's make our word our  bond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'll yield back to my colleague from North Carolina.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Texas for coming over and helping shed some light on this subject. As he has pointed out, and our colleague from Florida pointed out, a lot of things have been said, not just in the heat of a campaign, but in very deliberate opportunities, either on the floor of the House or in plans that were drawn up, in press releases. These were not slips of the tongue that were made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me point out to anyone who might have just joined us that, in addition to having the Official Truth Squad which has been operating for about 18 months here in the House to correct misstatements that are made by the people on the other side of the aisle so often, a group of us are going to be highlighting this new report which has just come out today, House Democrats Top 100 Broken Promises, put together by the Republican leaders offices here in the House of Representatives. We think it's  important to highlight what was promised to the American people last year, this year and what have been the results of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, while my colleague from Texas was speaking, I was just thinking about the fact that most of our colleagues have left the Chamber tonight, they're on their way home for the 4th of July recess. And I can remember, it has been just a short time ago, that the Democrats promised that they would get all the appropriations bills passed by the 4th of July recess. I'm not sure that that broken promise is even in here. But as of today, we passed 6 out of 12. So half of the appropriations bills  got passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I've even had some of them accuse us of being the problem in not being able to get the bills passed or not being able to go home on Friday afternoon. And I looked at one of my colleagues one day who said that, and I said, wait a minute; who's in charge here? You all blamed us last year for things we didn't accomplish. Now you're blaming us for things you don't accomplish. I find it very interesting that they're very good at doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So our goal here is to simply hold them accountable. I think the American people want their government held accountable for what we promise to do. And as I said earlier, I'm very troubled by having come to a House that I revere so much, this House of Representatives, and find that the American people have such a low opinion of us, based partly, I think, on this very situation that we're faced with, promises made, promises broken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know when I was a child, and I know with my daughter and with my grandchildren, they take promises very, very seriously. And I think the American people take promises very, very seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I know that Republicans did not always live up to their reputation of being fiscal conservatives in the last 4 years, I would say, that they were in control of this House. But I don't think anybody can accuse us of having broken promises the way the Democrats have broken promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, like most of my colleagues, want to work with the Democrats on getting things accomplished for the American people. But we find that difficult to do when we know that we can't count on their word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to bring up a few more of these promises that have been made and broken that I think are going to be very, very good for the American people to be reminded of. I'm going to go in this report that's highlighted here to Democratic Promise No. 16, lower gasoline prices. I know this is a big concern in my district. It's a big concern to me. Promise: "Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices. Join Democrats who are working to lower gas prices now." That was said by then minority leader Nancy  Pelosi, Democrat, California in a press release, April 19, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise: And I'm going to quote from USA Today, May 22, 2007. "The average price of gasoline hit $3.218 a gallon, up a stunning 11.5 cents the past week, and just half a penny shy of the inflation adjusted record the government reported. The average is almost certain this week to pass the inflation adjusted high of 3.223 recorded in May 1981 by the Energy Information Administration." And that comes from an article entitled Average Gasoline Price Nears 1981 Average. And as I said, it's  from USA Today, May 22, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats have been in power for 6 months and gas prices have gone up, not down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democratic Promise No. 17: Make energy reform a top priority. Promise: "Democrats promise to hit the ground running on energy issues if they win control of the House or Senate. Responding to voters concerns about $3 a gallon gasoline and the soaring cost of home heating oil, Democratic leaders in both Chambers have ranked energy as one of their top priorities for the next Congress." That's from an article entitled Energy Reserving a Front Burner, National Journal, September 9, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise: And this is a quote from Energy and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Environment Daily, May 18, 2007. "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat, California, issued a clear directive soon after Democrats took control of Congress this year, promising a comprehensive energy and climate change bill on the House floor by the 4th of July. But with five legislative work weeks to go before that deadline, House Democrats are still left with the task of cobbling together a bill from as many as 11 committees. As for the deadline itself, a House Democratic aide close  to the process said the package will not arrive on the House floor before the July 4th recess."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that aide was certainly correct. We just adjourned today for the 4th of July recess, and we certainly did not have an energy bill to vote on. And 6 months after the Democrats took power in Congress, no comprehensive energy reform has ever been passed by the House, much less sent to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democratic Promise No. 18: Make global warming a top priority. Promise: Again from Speaker  Nancy Pelosi. "The most urgent environmental issue facing us today is global warming." And this comes from a piece attributed to the Speaker, a New Direction for America, page 9.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise: June 1, 2007, Congress Daily PM. "Pelosi says global warming bill might wait until next year. Doesn't sound like it's a very urgent issue if they're going to put it off for a year."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the promises and the broken promises related to energy continue to go on and on and on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Will the gentlelady yield?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>And I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you were reading those interesting broken promises, I was thumbing through here and saw my name in one of them so I thought I might read about it. Broken promise No. 43: Protect U.S. Borders. Promise: "I believe there is virtually unanimous agreement in Congress that we must secure our borders and know who is entering our country." Then-House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, press release May 25, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promise: "Democrats are for the rule of law. We want to get the border security right. We would do what's necessary to protect our borders." Then House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, press release December 15, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise: "Just 6 months after Democrats took power in the House, 114 House Democrats voted against a Republican proposal to provide the funds necessary for construction of at least two layers of reinforced fencing, the installation of additional physical barrier, roads, lighting cameras and sensors pursuant to section 102 (b)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1986." This comes from the GOP Motion to Recommit, a rollcall vote, June 15, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise: "218 Democrats voted against an amendment by Representative John Carter, Republican,  Texas to strike new bureaucratic hurdles in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill designed to undermine the Department's efforts to complete the construction of the fence along the border. As Brit Hume said recently on Fox News: `House Democrats added more than a dozen new rules the administration must meet before it can spend more money on the border  fence.' Special report, Brit Hume, Fox News, June 18, 2007." And I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, thank you for helping to get on the record these broken promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I think over the next several months, we will do our best to make sure that we bring them out one after another, and I am sure we are probably going to have another hundred of them to be able to talk about in the next 6 months without any difficulty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk about fiscal responsibility and taxes a little bit because I think this is something else the American people are quite concerned about. Let me talk about Democratic Promise No. 49, "Restore Fiscal Responsibility." Promise: "Democrats offer a New Direction which includes fiscal responsibility," Democratic Caucus Chairman James Clyburn, press release, October 10, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promise: "We will work together to lead the House of Representatives with a commitment to integrity, to civility, and to fiscal responsibility," Speaker-Elect Nancy Pelosi, press release, November 16, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promise: "It is imperative to the future of our Nation that we come together, Democrats and Republicans, and restore fiscal responsibility," Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Democrat, Maryland, press release, January 23, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise, and this comes from the Post and Courier in Charleston, South Carolina: "Clyburn Defends Budget Earmarks," February 21, 2007. "Now Democratic Whip James Clyburn, Democrat, South Carolina, also said he loves appearing in the Citizens Against Government Waste Pig Book. `I want to be there as often as I possibly can for as much money as I possibly can,' he said."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Folks, these are not conservative publications that are putting these quotes out and calling the Democrats to task. These are what we would generally call liberal newspapers. And there are lots of quotes from the New York Times. I just haven't gotten to them yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise relating to the promises I just read: "Democrats resorted to begging, threatening, and, worst of all, bribing Members for their votes with $21 billion in pork-barrel projects ..... Loading a bill that's supposed to keep our soldiers in bullets, boots, and beans, pork-barrel bribes for congressional colleagues must be a low point in the history of the U.S. Congress. This destroys any pretense Democrats have to being a party of fiscal responsibility and good government." This came  from the Colorado Springs Gazette editorial, March 27, 2007, in an editorial entitled "Buying Votes; Military Funding Bill a Stain on Congress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken Promise: "It's hard to say which is worse: Democratic leaders offering peanuts for a vote of this magnitude or Members allowing their votes to be bought for peanuts." This is from a USA Today editorial, March 22, 2007, entitled "Pork Has No Place in `Emergency' War Bill."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the kinds of things that make the American public cynical about their elected officials. And it is nothing that the Republicans are saying about the Democrats. It is what the publications of this country are saying about them and showing over and over and over how they have broken their promises. I don't think that we could probably get into a stack up to here of all of the statements that have been made in all of the presses about the broken promises of the Democrats in the first 6  months of their majority reign, but I do think that it is important that we point out some of them so people can make the comparison between what has been said to them and what was promised to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democratic Promise No. 57. It is entitled "Institute `PAYGO' to Control Spending."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promise by Speaker  Nancy Pelosi on her Web site: "Democrats are committed to fiscal responsibility through pay-as-you-go budgets so that our children and grandchildren are not saddled with mountains of debt."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise, and again this is not coming from a Republican or conservative publication. This is coming from the San Diego Union Tribune in an editorial dated April 16, 2007. The quote: "In Washington ..... congressional leaders have imposed pay-as-you-go budget rules that exclude the existing entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which dominate Federal spending. So `PAYGO' is really just political cover for new taxes to support new spending."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the people in the country have gotten this other than the Republican Members of this Congress, and it is very important that these things be published so that people understand what they are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you one more here. Democratic Promise No. 58, "Adopt Honest Budgets." Promise: "The new Democratic-led House takes America in a new direction, a fiscally responsible budget with the right priorities. Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt is a master of the budget, and he and his team have done an outstanding job reflecting the right American priorities and values," Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, press release, March 21, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise: "American families don't have the option of using gimmicks to put their family budgets in order. But such rules weren't applied by House Democrats in crafting their budget, which is loaded with trickery that hardly reflects American priorities and values. The House and Senate versions of the budget depend on reserve funds to pay for additional spending. There is only one catch: The reserve funds are empty." And the title of this, "Democrats Banking on Empty Reserves." The  source, Los Angeles Times, March 27, 2007. Again, hardly a conservative place to come up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked earlier about earmarks, and I think that it is very important, again, that we talk a little bit more about the issue of earmarks because I think that was one of the more egregious of the promises that were made and then broken by the Democrats. And had we not called their hand on it 2 weeks ago in this very Chamber with our standing up and protesting what they were doing to keep the earmarks a secret so that the American people could not judge whether the votes we were taking on the  bills were votes that we should be taking, but, no, the Democrats had promised transparency, but they weren't about to do it until we made them do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democratic Promise No. 68: "Allow Lawmakers to Challenge Individual Earmarks." Promise: "I think, first of all, with any bill, any provision, whether it is an earmark or not, there should be transparency. So that is what we have said, and I hope you would agree, that before Members vote on a bill, there should be appropriate time for people to be able to read it, that it would be a matter of public record, and if there is an earmark that can stand the scrutiny, then that transparency will  give the opportunity for it to be there," then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in a press conference, March 16, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broken promise: "Rather than including specific pet projects, grants, and contracts in legislation as it is being written, Democrats are following an order by House Appropriations Committee chairman to keep the bills free of such earmarks until it is too late for critics to effectively challenge them." The title of the article: "House Democrats Sidestep Their Own Rule to Shield Lawmakers' Pet Projects From Scrutiny," Associated Press, June 3, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, we believe that it is our responsibility to bring to the American people a list of these broken promises, the promises made and then the promises broken, because the House Democrats haven't kept their promises to the American people, whether it is the result of inaction or an inability to govern. On issue after issue, the 110th Congress has failed to meet the needs of working families, soldiers battling radical jihadists, senior citizens, and others who are waiting  for Washington to offer serious solutions to the problems facing the country. One look at the polls shows Americans are taking notice and they aren't pleased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But where the majority is failing to lead, Republicans are stepping up. While Democrats broke their promise to operate the House floor in an open, fair, and bipartisan manner, Republicans have found ways to strengthen and expose flaws in Democratic bills. While Democrats broke their promise to lead the most open, honest, and ethical Congress in history, Republicans are pushing for commonsense ethics rules that hold lawmakers to a higher standard. While Democrats broke their promise to deliver  transparency in spending taxpayer dollars, Republicans have forced the majority to restore GOP earmark reforms that bring greater transparency and accountability to Federal spending. While Democrats broke their promise to enact legislation that makes America energy independent, Republicans believe we can lower gas prices and reduce our dependence on foreign energy by increasing domestic energy supplies, conserving more, and investing in the technologies of tomorrow. While</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Republicans are working to earn back the majority, Democrats are acting like the entrenched majority they led before, saying one thing to Americans outside of Washington and doing something different inside the Capitol building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the next few weeks, every House Democrat must answer this key question: Why haven't you kept your promises?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't have a Web site available like some of the other groups do. But I can tell you that this publication, "House Democrats' Top 100 Broken Promises," will be available from any Republican Member of this Congress, and I am sure that we can make it available. I am sure it is on a Web site, probably on the Web sites of all of the leadership: Republican Leader John Boehner, Republican Whip Roy Blunt, Conference Chair Adam Putnam, Policy Chairman Thaddeus McCotter,  Conference Vice Chair Kay Granger, Conference Secretary John Carter, Chief Deputy Whip Eric Cantor, Rules Committee Ranking Republican David Dreier. My guess is that it can be found on any of their Web sites. I am going to make sure that it is on my Web site in the next few days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think, again, it is important that we hold people to the promises that they have made and make sure that the American people don't continue to have this very negative opinion of the Congress of the United States. We want this House to be respected. We want the Senate to be respected. And we need to live up to our promises so that we can get on with the important work that the American people have sent us here to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the people's House, and I am extraordinarily proud to be a Member of this House. And I know I join with other Republicans in saying that we want to bring back respect and integrity to this House so it is not called a House of hypocrisy.</paragraph>
