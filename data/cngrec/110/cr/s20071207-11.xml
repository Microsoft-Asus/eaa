  <narrative>TEFAP EMERGENCY FUNDING -- (Senate - December 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15012">S15012</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday, I stood on the Senate floor and asked for emergency funding for the Nation's food banks. I asked for that funding because there are massive shortages of food bank supplies, empty shelves, and those shortages place at risk children, the elderly, and working families, people who have lost jobs, people who have had a string of bad luck, and families across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke yesterday of Norm, an elderly man in Cleveland, who, after spending his few dollars on rent, on utilities, and medicine, has $19 left. He needs the Cleveland Food Bank. The Cleveland Food Bank, I would add, was awarded the best food bank in the country last year, but it is running short, as are food banks everywhere in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke yesterday of Christian, who has trained to be a nurse's assistant, and who just gave birth. She is unable to find a job as a nurse's assistant, even though she is well trained to do that. She runs short of food, and she relies on, as does Norm, neighborhood food programs, such as the Cleveland Food Bank and other church groups in greater Cleveland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In too many cases there is no dinner on the table. In too many cases there is no food at Christmas time. In too many cases there is just not enough food. We are the wealthiest Nation in the world. Yet we cannot feed our own people. This is an emergency. This is an outrage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I talked about emergency funding to overcome that shortage. We asked for $40 million until we pass the farm bill, which will have some dollars in it to provide some supply for these food banks. We found out that food banks are projecting they will run out of food in February, when originally they thought it would last until July.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In case after case, food banks in Cleveland, in Columbus, in Toledo, and Cincinnati, food banks in the Chair's city of Baltimore, and food banks all over this country are running out of food. Grocery stores are contributing a little less this year, and the Government has not done its part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I talked about some $40 million in funding to overcome that shortage, and today I want to talk about how to pay for it. We can pay for it through shared sacrifice. The budget for Congress includes firewood for fireplaces in the Capitol, fireplaces, in most cases, that don't get used. When children are hungry, we can give up fireplaces. We can give up some travel and some new technology. We can make easy sacrifices to address a tragic need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget for Federal agencies includes annual buying sprees to exhaust whatever is left in departmental budgets. When children are hungry, buying sprees are offensive. We can sacrifice. We can pay for emergency funding for food banks by putting our heads together and shaving some less necessary spending from our own budgets and that of Federal agencies whose oversight is our responsibility. I am asking that we do that. Food banks need resources. We don't need firewood, we don't need buying  sprees, and we can do without some other things. We need to help hungry people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to propose a package of cuts to pay for an emergency increase in food bank funding. I hope every Member of this body supports me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
