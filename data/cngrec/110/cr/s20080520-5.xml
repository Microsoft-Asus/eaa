  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader time, there will be a period of morning business until noon, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the second. At 12 noon, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: Michael McGinn, of Minnesota, to be U.S. Marshal for the District of Minnesota; Ralph E. Martinez, of Florida, to be a member of the Foreign Claims Settlement  Commission of the United States; and G. Steven Agee, of Virginia, to be U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time from noon until 12:30 is equally divided and controlled between Senator Leahy and Senator Specter. The Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly caucus luncheons. At 2:15, there will be 15 minutes for debate equally divided and controlled between Senators WARNER and WEBB or their designees. At 2:30, the Senate will proceed to a rollcall vote on the confirmation of the Agee nomination. Upon confirmation of the Agee nomination--and I am  confident that will take place--the other two nominations will be confirmed by consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following executive session, we expect to consider the House message accompanying <bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>, the 2008 emergency supplemental. As previously announced, the time from 11 a.m. until 12 noon tomorrow will be set aside for tributes to former President Lyndon B. Johnson on the centennial of his birth.</paragraph>
