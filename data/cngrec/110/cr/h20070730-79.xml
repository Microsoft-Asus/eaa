    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>, which I authored in my capacity as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, is a critical piece of legislation that will strengthen the management of the Coast Guard's Deepwater procurement program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> passed both the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on a voice vote and has enjoyed bipartisan support from the members of both the subcommittee and the full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to express my deepest appreciation to Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR for his leadership and support on this measure, and, indeed, for his leadership of our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also express my appreciation to the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Mica, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Congressman LaTourette, for their leadership and the commitment they have shown to the success of our United States Coast Guard through their work on the bill before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, I wish to thank Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON for his wise counsel on this bill and for working with us to get this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deepwater is a $24 billion, 25-year procurement effort through which the Coast Guard will replace or rehabilitate all of its cutters and aircraft. Management of the program was awarded in 2002 through a performance-based contract to a private sector team comprised of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, now known as the Integrated Coast Guard Systems or ICGS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, some of the procurements conducted under Deepwater over the past 5 years have experienced unacceptable failures that have delayed the production of needed assets and contributed to a significant shortfall in Coast Guard patrol hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most widely publicized failure of the Deepwater program is the failure of the effort to lengthen 110-foot patrol boats already in the Coast Guard's fleet to 123 feet. The lengthening was intended to upgrade these boats and extend their service lives while newer assets were being developed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though warned by Navy experts that the proposed designs for the lengthening was inadequate, the Coast Guard proceeded with the effort anyway. Eight boats, which originally cost some $60 million to produce and which had many years of additional service life left, buckled soon after they were lengthened and now sit sadly in the Coast Guard yard in Baltimore waiting for the scrap heap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the failure of the 123-foot patrol boats is not the sole failure of the Deepwater program. The initial design of the Fast Response Cutter was also beset by technical failures, though fortunately these were identified before any ships were built. While this acquisition effort has now been revamped, the GAO reported earlier this year that the design failure has delayed the procurement by at least 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, the failed effort to lengthen the 110-foot patrol boats and the failure of the first design of the Fast Response Cutter wasted another $100 million of hard-earned American taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, despite the obligation of another $100 million, the initial design effort on the Vertical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, which is needed to enhance the surveillance capacity of the National Security Cutter, also failed. This craft had originally been scheduled for delivery in 2007, but the GAO estimates that delivery will now be delayed by as much as 6 years, meaning that the first National Security Cutters will likely enter service without the vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General found that the hull fatigue life on the National Security Cutter, the most expensive asset to be procured under the Deepwater program, may not meet contractual requirements. The IG warns that fixing the hulls of the first two NSCs, which are already well into production, will add potentially significant costs to these ships and may even affect their operational capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this troubling record of failure and waste, during the first 4 years of the Deepwater program, the Coast Guard ranked the contractor performance between "very good" and "excellent" and awarded the ICGS team some $16 million in award fees; in other words, in bonuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such a situation is ridiculous and intolerable. Having convened now three hearings on Deepwater in the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation in the 110th Congress and having chaired an investigative hearing on the 120-foot patrol boat program convened in the full Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure by Chairman Oberstar, we have had the opportunity to closely examine the failures in contractor performance and in Coast Guard management that have occurred since  2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> responds directly to these failures by requiring the creation of the management systems and the appointment of the personnel needed to enable the Coast Guard to manage Deepwater as effectively as the service managed the truly amazing rescues of victims during Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Commandant Thad Allen, the service is already moving decisively to correct past mistakes. Admiral Allen has formed a new procurement directorate to professionalize acquisition management and to put the business practices in place needed to effectively oversee contractor performance and to create lines of strict accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard is now also directly managing the procurement of the Fast Response Cutter, and it has issued a solicitation that includes new measures specifically intended to focus the procurement on producing an asset that will meet all performance requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>, would build on the important reforms Admiral Allen has already enacted by putting in place a comprehensive package of reforms that will strengthen the institutional capacity of the Coast Guard to manage not only Deepwater but all other procurements for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> will require that the Coast Guard be in charge of all technical decisions on Deepwater and would require the use of full and open competition for the procurement of new assets to ensure that the Coast Guard receives the best value for taxpayers' resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> also sets rigorous new standards for the testing and certification of all Deepwater assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires that all new National Security Cutters procured from the date of enactment be certified by an independent third party to meet all contractual requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DHS Inspector General has testified before our subcommittee that the four audits of Deepwater he has conducted over the past 2 1/2  years have revealed the dominant influence of expediency and schedule over performance quality in the management of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the shoddy results of the prioritization of expediency and schedule can be seen in the 123-foot patrol boats, which cannot float, and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, which did not fly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professional certification of the design and construction of NSCs 3 through 8 will help ensure that these assets do not have any structural shortcomings, as such certification should be accommodated in all procurement schedules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, given the serious concerns that currently exist over hull fatigue with NSCs 1 and 2, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> requires that the design used in all future NSCs be submitted to an assessment conducted by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, before construction on the new NSCs begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carderock identified many of the potential hull fatigue problems with NSC 1 and their expertise will help assess whether proposed design changes for subsequent NSCs truly correct design problems that could shorten the hull fatigue life of those ships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> requires that all other new cutters acquired under Deepwater be classified by the American Bureau of Shipping, and it requires that all new aircraft and aircraft engines be certified for airworthiness by an independent third party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Significantly, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> also requires the appointment of a civilian as the head of the acquisitions directorate. Both the DHS Inspector General and the GAO have testified before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation regarding the importance of personnel continuity in the effective management of acquisitions contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Appointment of a civilian with a career's worth of experience in procurement will bring to the Coast Guard the level of expertise that simply is not cultivated among the service's uniformed personnel given that the service lacks a career path to train acquisitions professionals. Of course, while the appointment of a civilian to head Coast Guard acquisitions functions cannot guarantee continuity, the appointment of a uniformed servicemember will guarantee turnover on a predictable schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the implementation of these measures that will prepare the Coast Guard to manage Deepwater, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> requires that private sector contractors be phased out as the lead systems integrator by October 1, 2011. This phase-out can occur prior to that date if the Coast Guard certifies they have the personnel and systems in place they need to perform the lead systems integration function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I remain completely confident in Admiral Allen's leadership of the Coast Guard and in his management of the Deepwater program, but I also believe that Congress must act to build within the Coast Guard the systems that will enable the service to effectively manage procurement efforts, and manage taxpayer resources, long after Admiral Allen has retired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women of the Coast Guard will rely on the assets procured under Deepwater for decades to come to defend our homeland against an ever-growing range of threats. This is a procurement effort that simply must be managed correctly, and I'm confident that the enactment of <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> will ensure that it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has enjoyed bipartisan support, both in the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I also note that the Congressional Budget Office has found that enacting this measure will not affect revenues or direct spending in any way and could result in lower procurement expenditures and reduce the long-term costs of the Deepwater program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I again commend Chairman JIM OBERSTAR, chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for his strong support and his commitment to excellence. Under his inspired leadership, our committee has truly returned oversight and strict accountability to the agenda and is working to enact the ground-breaking policies that are essential to meeting the transportation challenges of the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Mica, for his leadership and support on this measure; and I commend the ranking member of our subcommittee, the distinguished gentleman, Mr. LaTourette, for his hard work and his outstanding leadership on the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to demonstrate their commitment to our brave young men and women in our Coast Guard, our thin blue line at sea, by supporting <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>, the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, makes significant changes to the Coast Guard's Deepwater program and will reform the way that the Coast Guard oversees, manages, and carries out the program as the service takes on the lead systems integrator responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to add my thanks on the floor tonight and appreciate the cooperation of Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings to consider both at the subcommittee and during the full committee markup amendments from our side of the aisle to improve the bill through the markup process. The bill that we are considering today is the product of several oversight hearings and has been developed under the regular order in both the subcommittee and full committee markups. I want to thank  both chairmen for their efforts to develop this bill in a truly bipartisan manner</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate the cooperation of Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman CUMMINGS to consider amendments from my side of the aisle to improve this bill through the markup process. The bill that we are considering today is the product of several oversight hearings and has been developed under the regular order in both Subcommittee and Full Committee markups. I thank both Chairmen for their efforts to develop this bill in a bipartisan manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Subcommittee has held four hearings to oversee the Deepwater program over the past six months, and we have delved into the problems that have troubled this critical acquisition program. This bill addresses many of the areas that were identified through our oversight process. This bill will provide the Coast Guard with the framework to turn the program around and to support the successful acquisition of enhanced vessels, aircraft, and systems necessary to carry out the service's many missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I do want to point out that despite problems with some Deepwater program--most notably the failed 110 to 123 conversion, the program has had successes. Most importantly, the improved communications between shore, sea and air assets have already led to improved operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to note that not all of the program's problems result from contracting issues. The program has never been funded at the level the Coast Guard determined it needed to carry out the program in the timeframe it described. Unfortunately, it appears those funding shortfalls will only get worse in the coming fiscal year. In fiscal year 2007, $1.1 billion was appropriated to carry out the Deepwater program. For fiscal year 2008, the Administration sought $837 million for the program, the  House has provided $698 million, and the Senate has approved an amount of $770 million. At those levels, acquisitions of new ships and aircraft will be further delayed, meaning that ready-to-be-retired legacy ships and planes will be kept in service longer. Those assets will, in turn, incur higher maintenance costs further reducing the funds available to acquire new assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today improves the organization and administration of Deepwater and seeks answers to questions about the implementation of the program. However, if Congress and the Administration continue to fail to seek and provide funds at the level planned for, then Deepwater has no chance of meeting its targets and goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill will not solve the problems that result from funding shortfalls for the Deepwater program, the bill will give the Coast Guard adequate time to build its in-house staff and capabilities to the level necessary to successfully assume the lead systems integrator role and to put in place arrangements to acquire additional personnel and expertise from the private sector and other Federal agencies. This is a necessary programmatic change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this bill and urge all Members to approve <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, the House considers <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>, the "Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act". This legislation is the product of the lessons learned from a series of hearings delving into the Coast Guard's Deepwater program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Subcommittee Chairman CUMMINGS for his diligence in thoroughly examining these problems and for developing a comprehensive bill to get this program back on course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee has held three hearings in the 110th Congress on the Deepwater program--including one that finally adjourned at 11:29 p.m. Committee Members have heard the saga about problems with this program that include inadequate staffing, patrol boats that have been altered in such a way that they are not seaworthy, and construction standards that shorten the fatigue life of cutters below their contracted 30-year life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During these hearings, the Committee heard testimony from the Coast Guard, contractors, the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") of the Department of Homeland Security, and the Government Accountability Office ("GAO"), and in addition received reports from the Defense Acquisition University ("DAU"), the GAO, and the OIG.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we learned from the testimony to the Committee that the Deepwater program is an example of a total abdication of governmental responsibility for overseeing its contractors, the quality of their work, and the timeline for completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> will correct this problem. The bill establishes within the Coast Guard the acquisition management systems, and requires appointment of necessary personnel, to effectively manage the $24 billion Deepwater Acquisition Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As reported by the Committee, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> prohibits the use of a private sector entity as a lead system integrator beginning at the earlier date of October 1, 2011, or the date on which the Coast Guard certifies to the Committee that the service has the trained personnel and resources to implement the system integration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that the Coast Guard intends to move forward well before the 2011 date and I can assure you that this Committee will monitor their progress on taking over the Deepwater program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> also requires the use of full and open competition for procurements under Deepwater, and sets forth specific provisions to be included in future contracts including requirements subjecting designs to technical review and development of independent cost estimates. Transient electromagnetic pulse emanation ("TEMPEST") standards, as used by the Department of the Navy, must be used for procurements requiring TEMPEST certification. The bill further requires that all contracts include provisions  allowing the OIG to privately interview contractor personnel working on Deepwater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also requires the appointment of a civilian Chief Acquisition Officer within the Coast Guard, who would report directly to the Commandant, and specifies a number of authorities reserved to the Chief Acquisition Officer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> sets standards for testing and certification of assets procured under Deepwater. Each cutter--other than a National Security Cutter (NSC)--must be classed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). The design and construction of NSCs, with the exception of NSC 1 and 2, must be certified as capable of being underway for at least 185 days a year for 30 years and the other performance requirements by an independent third-party such as ABS or the Navy. The bill calls for all aircraft to  be certified by an independent third-party such as the FAA or the Navy as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill requires a number of reports to Congress from the Coast Guard to enhance the Committee's oversight of this important acquisition program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Ranking Member MICA and Subcommittee Ranking Member LATOURETTE for working with Subcommittee Chairman CUMMINGS and me on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>, the "Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act of 2007".</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I stand in support of <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> because I recognize the importance of the Integrated Deepwater Systems (Deepwater) program to our National security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to replace our aging ships and aircraft that operate offshore to protect our borders. While this program has come under much scrutiny for being more expensive than previously thought and taking more time to complete, it is still a worthwhile endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyday, valiant members of the U.S. Coast Guard risk their lives to rescue and protect Americans. The continued success of this mission is dependent upon Coast Guard assets which are aging by the day. In the mid-1990s, the Coast Guard decided to replace all of these assets in a single procurement program--the Integrated Deepwater System program, typically referred to as Deepwater. The Coast Guard's plan was to set forth broad mission requirements and then rely on private contractors to determine  the mix of assets necessary to carry out those missions. Ultimately, the contract went to "Integrated Coast Guard System" (ICGS), a consortium headed by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deepwater was intended to replace or modernize the approximately 90 ships and 200 Coast Guard aircraft used for missions taking place more than 50 miles offshore. The primary missions carried out in this "deepwater" zone are drug and migrant interdiction operations, search and rescue, homeland security, and fisheries law enforcement. Unfortunately, this program has been beset with problems. One part of the ICGS's Deepwater plan was to lengthen the Coast Guard's existing 110 foot patrol boats  by 113 feet. Shortly after the first extended boat was delivered, cracks were found in its hull. The Coast Guard dry-docked the boats in December 2006 due to the lack of operational capacity in heavy seas. On February 14, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released a report concerning whistleblower</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the contractor did not install low smoke cabling aboard the 123-foot cutter, despite a Deepwater contract requirement. The intent of this requirement was to eliminate the polyvinyl chloride jacket encasing the cables, which for years produced toxic fumes and dense smoke during shipboard fire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the contractor installed C4ISR topside equipment aboard both the 123-foot cutters and prosecutors, which either did not comply or was not tested to ensure compliance with specific environmental performance requirements outlined in the Deepwater contract. On April 17, 2007, the Commandant of the Coast Guard announced the decommissioning of the entire 123-foot fleet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, there are problems with the National Security Cutter. On January 23, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's Office released a report stating that "the National Security Cutter, as designed and constructed, would not meet the performance specifications described in the original Deepwater contract." The report also states that "The National Security Cutter's design and performance deficiencies are fundamentally the result of the Coast Guard's failure to exercise  technical oversight over the design and construction of its Deepwater assets."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the Inspector General's Office found that "since the deepwater contract was signed in June 2002, the combined cost of National Security Cutters 1 and 2 has increased from $517 million to approximately $775 million." The $775 estimate does not include costs to correct or mitigate the National Security Cutter's structural design deficiencies, additional labor and materials costs resulting from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and the final costs of a $302 million Request for Equitable  Adjustment (REA) that the Coast Guard is currently negotiating with the contractor. Finally, the report states that the Inspector General's Office "encountered resistance" from the Coast Guard and the contractor in its efforts to evaluate the structural design and performance issues associated with the cutter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The IG's findings are very serious and I am deeply concerned about the Coast Guard's ability to manage the Deepwater program. Strict Congressional oversight on the part of the new Democratic Congress has forced the Coast Guard to make several significant changes to this much-needed program and continued oversight is needed. The Homeland Security Committee has already held one hearing on the Deepwater Program this year, and more are planned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> makes improvements to the Deepwater program that will refine the process and make it effective for protecting the homeland for decades to come. For instance this bill creates a process for the Coast Guard to become the lead systems integrator for the program, it opens up competition for procurements, requires the Coast Guard to provide life-cycle cost estimates, requires the appointment of a Chief Acquisitions Officer, establishes testing and certification requirements for Deepwater  assets, provides design criteria for the National Security Cutter, and allows the Department of Homeland Security to work with the United States Navy. These changes to the program are necessary to make Deepwater an effective homeland security program.</paragraph>
