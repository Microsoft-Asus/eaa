  <chair> (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more effective against  disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health insurance and employment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having presumed genetic "defects" such as mental retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to "correct" apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have since been repealed, and many  have been modified to include essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection. However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels Congressional action in this area.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are associated with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular group may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which  afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is voluntary.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and health insurance.</chair>
  <chair> (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination  law, these laws vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence that the American public and the medical community find the existing patchwork of State  and Federal laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, and new therapies.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;center&gt;TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE&lt;/center&gt;</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we consider <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. I first wish to congratulate Representative Slaughter for her leadership on this bill on which she has worked for better than 13 years. It has been a privilege to join her in that work, and I am delighted that it has brought us to today's vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent advances in research have made it possible to identify the genetic basis for human diseases. These breakthroughs, magnificent as they are, have opened the door to early detection and treatment of diseases and prevention strategies geared to a person's genetic makeup. At the same time, this information can also be used to unfairly discriminate against or stigmatize individuals when it comes to insurance and employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To protect individuals from insurance discrimination, <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill> would prohibit health insurers, both in group and individual markets, from canceling, denying, refusing to renew or changing the terms or premiums of coverage based solely on genetic predispositions towards specific diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, in order to protect individuals from employment discrimination, this bill would make it unlawful for employers or other hiring entities to use an individual's genetic information regarding hiring, firing, promotion or other terms and conditions of employment. The legislation requires that genetic information be treated as a part of the individual's confidential medical record and that employers maintain separate forms or files for any genetic information that they may obtain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives passed this legislation a year ago with a strong bipartisan vote of 420-3. Unfortunately, the measure has been held up in the Senate, as usual. With these concerns now resolved, we are close to providing Americans the ability to undergo genetic testing that may indicate early treatment and prevention of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's, without fear of losing their health insurance or affecting adversely the conditions of their employment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself 1 additional minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill currently before us includes clarifying language intended to ease the concerns of some of my colleagues and is identical to the version passed by the Senate last week. These changes include a firewall between title I and II of the bill. The modifications clarify that employers are not liable for health insurance violations under civil rights laws unless the employer has separately violated a provision of title II governing employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The changes also make it clear that while individuals are protected from discrimination based on genetic predisposition, the authority of insurance companies to base coverage and pricing on the actual presence of a disease is not affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These changes broaden the base of support for the bill and allow us to bring it to the House floor with the expectation that it will be signed into law by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this bill and for coming together to make this legislation a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to yield back the remainder of my time to my distinguished friend from California, the Honorable George Miller, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, and that he be permitted to yield that time in accordance with his whims.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while it is not a perfect bill, I do believe it contains a number of important improvements over prior versions of this legislation, including that which I supported a little over a year ago on the House floor. More importantly, it marks a commitment by this Congress to ensure that the laws of the United States protect American workers and health care consumers from discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup. Because that goal is so critical, I will vote for this bill  today, and urge my colleagues to do likewise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I turn to the substance of my remarks, I would like to commend my colleague and fellow Member on the Committee on Education and Labor, Representative Judy Biggert, for her years of work and dedication on this important issue. She has been persistent and effective on so many issues that have come before this committee and this Congress and she should be commended for adding this important bill to her list of legislative accomplishments. I also want to commend the gentlewoman from  New York, the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, who has been Mrs. Biggert's partner in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I noted during our committee's consideration of this bill last year, I believe the title of the legislation before us, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, embodies a proposition that all Members of our committee and indeed our Congress would endorse. Simply put, no employee should face discrimination on the basis of his or her genetic makeup or on any other characteristic other than his or her ability to do the job. Similarly, no employee should risk his or her health insurance  status simply because of the possibility that they might some day develop an illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill was drafted with those fundamental principles in mind, and I believe that through the legislative process, we have taken steps toward ensuring that the bill we send the President today ensures that those principles are fulfilled, while minimizing the potential for unintended consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would take this opportunity to point out a number of improvements in the bill that I think merit attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Foremost, I am pleased that the bill we will send today to the White House for President Bush to sign embodies the same logic as a past executive order issued by President Clinton to ensure that this legislation would not inadvertently serve as a broad new Federal mandate requiring all insurance plans and employers to cover all treatments related to genetic-related conditions. That is exactly the type of unintended consequences we were seeking to avoid, and I am pleased we were able to work this  out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I would highlight a provision in the legislation that ensures that employers who are currently subject to a number of confidentiality and recordkeeping requirements under law are not burdened by yet another redundant set of paperwork requirements. The bill before us today provides that, with respect to genetic information, if an employer maintains employee records and treats them as it does confidential medical records under the Americans With Disabilities Act, it is in compliance with  this new genetics law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, I applaud a significant improvement in the bill; namely, its extension of genetic nondiscrimination protection to all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the issues raised during our committee's consideration of the bill was concern that the bill's protections did not adequately extend to cover children in utero or at early stages of development, or in connection with in vitro fertilization and other technologies. I am very pleased that the final bill before us addresses this issue to the satisfaction of all Members on both sides of the aisle who worked in good faith to ensure the broadest protections possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate amendment we consider today contains a number of other improvements over prior versions, including important provisions relating to those who participate in genetic clinical testing, providing for use of genetic information in matters of public health safety, and ensuring the most focused scheme of remedies possible. These changes represent issues we were able to work through over the past year and which demonstrate how the legislative process is meant to work. We were presented with  well-intentioned legislation, heard meaningful testimony on it and its potential impact on employers and employees alike, raised and debated legitimate concerns, and worked through to bridge the gap between where we began and where we stand today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the staff from both sides of the aisle and in both chambers for making this a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before concluding my remarks, I would be remiss if I did not note for the record that I am still concerned that this bill is in some respects potentially overbroad. While we all agree with the goal of nondiscrimination I discussed earlier, the facts remain that we are poised today to adopt a sweeping new expansion to Federal Civil Rights scheme, the most expansive change since the adoption of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we send this bill to the President to sign into law, I would urge my colleagues to join me in remaining vigilant in the months to come in monitoring the administration of this new law to ensure that it addresses the problems it is intended to correct, and does not simply become yet another bureaucratic burden on employers or a lottery ticket for plaintiffs' lawyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that same light, as courts and administrative agencies interpret and enforce these laws, I would urge them to heed the intent of Congress; namely, that this bill's most egregious penalties must be reserved for the most egregious violations of the law. If experience under this new law shows that this is not the case, I trust my colleagues will join me in supporting swift action to correct any mistakes we have made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I will conclude my comments. As I noted at the outset of my remarks, our actions today will ensure that the law of the United States protects American workers and health care consumers from discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup, a goal I think is shared by every Member of this House. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would add my congratulations and praise to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) for the work that they have done to bring this bill finally to the floor for passage. It is a bill that has languished for over a decade. It is good to see that times have changed. We moved expeditiously last year through three committees and on to the floor, and it will leave this chamber today and head to the  White House for the President's signature. It is a small but long overdue step toward approving our health care system and preventing employment discrimination, and ensures that our laws governing patients' rights are as current as the latest medical technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply stated, the legislation provides peace of mind, and encourages people to take advantage of the miracles of modern medicine without fear of reprisal or consequences at work or in health care or in qualifying for insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GINA, as it is known, prohibits insurers and employees from using the genetic information to discriminate. Thus, a woman who has decided to find out whether she carries the breast cancer gene need not worry about losing her job or health insurance merely because she sought the test. Enactment of this law is critical to protect patients and is needed to encourage people to use robust genetic research and to encourage more research. Additional research will help us determine when we men will get  colon cancer or prostate cancer, and not be afraid to go and receive those tests for fear of being discriminated against.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support of more than 500 groups representing patients, employees, physicians, providers, and others who value the protection that this legislation provides. I urge strong support for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield the balance of our time for the Ways and Means Committee to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), and that he control the balance of our time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and want to commend all those that were instrumental in getting its passage to the floor, particularly my good friend, Judy Biggert from Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made some wonderful advances in health care research over the number of years. I can remember helping to lead the charge with my colleague, Mr. Waxman, on a bipartisan bill to double the money for the National Institutes of Health back in the nineties, and we had a similar effort in the Senate between John McCain, the Republican leader there of that same issue, and Paul Wellstone, a dear colleague who is no longer with us. But, together we passed that bipartisan legislation.  And with those advances, of course we have to look at other things that are pertinent, too, and that is why this Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember traveling to the University of Michigan and meeting with one of the researchers there that in fact had received an NIH grant; and he just weeks before, because of that grant, had identified the breast cancer gene that strikes one in eight women across America. He was excited. And it wouldn't have happened without that NIH money; but with that discovery, it is clear that we have to in fact protect that genetic information from being discriminated against by who knows who.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would say that, thanks to my colleagues, Mr. Deal, the ranking member on the Health Subcommittee who is in a hearing right now, and Joe  Barton, the ranking member, that we have all made advances and worked closely with Chairman Dingell to mitigate what we believed were some significant problems with the legislation as it was introduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other items, we wanted to make sure that any use of information by certain entities regulated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act not also be regulated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under title II of the bill. Such dual regulation of the use of information would have been highly disruptive and certainly inappropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also made numerous clarifications to make sure that the new regulatory scheme did not disrupt reasonable and needed activities by health plans to improve health care, coordinate benefits, process benefits, or educate beneficiaries. It is important for the Congress to be mindful that we are not writing on a blank slate each and every time that we launch one of these new regulatory and liability schemes. And I certainly join many here that are satisfied that these important improvements made  by the Committee on Energy and Commerce are preserved in the bill. I want to commend the bipartisan and bicameral discussions that led to this compromise, and I would urge that we all support it when a roll call vote comes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, I would yield the balance of our time that our committee controls to my friend from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Today, Americans buy health coverage believing they are doing the right thing and expecting that they have secured access for needed health services for themselves and their family. But, unfortunately, this is simply not always true. Individuals, regardless of their age or circumstances, are denied health coverage every day due to the evidence or existence of preexisting conditions. This could be anything from asthma to heart disease, and it could affect anyone from our Nation's  children to our grandparents to each of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 10 years, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act has provided protection for some individuals and families to ensure this information is not used to deny health coverage by either an employer or an insurer; but gaps still remain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the evolution of biomedical research, our Nation's scientists have discovered opportunities to use genetic information to prevent, diagnose, and more effectively treat some of the most devastating diseases of our lifetime. I am honored to represent some of these most brilliant researchers and scientists in Southeastern Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the great medical potential they are exploring, genetic information also has the potential to reduce health care costs with better prevention and disease management. We must ensure that these new revelations do not come with a price: Discrimination by employers, insurers, schools, or others based on genetic information of those who are not even sick but are simply identified as being predisposed to a specific disease. If we do not reassure our fellow Americans that they are safe  in taking full advantage of the opportunities provided by exploring the genetic information, then these advances in biomedical research could well be for naught.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this reason, I applaud my colleague, Representative Slaughter, for introducing the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and for being its champion for so many years. I am proud to support its passage today. It is important for all Americans and their access to health coverage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues have stated, passing this bill is an important step forward in protecting the health of every American. We should be proud of our efforts to work on a bipartisan basis to craft this legislation, and I want to recognize the efforts of the gentlewoman from Illinois, Congresswoman Biggert. This bill should be a model for our efforts to reform health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all agree that individuals should not be discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information. Employers and insurers should not be allowed to use genetic markers to deny employment or health coverage simply because they possess a particular gene. But genetic information can also be used to help patients. Health plans have an ability to interact with both patients and providers to highlight recommended tests and courses of action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, a person that has a gene for a certain type of cancer would be recommended to receive more frequent cancer screenings. Knowing this, the health insurer would know to approve coverage for these additional screenings because they would be at a higher risk of developing that type of cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all preach about transforming medicine to provide more preventative care. Now, we are finally at a point where medical technology can be effectively used to deliver the preventative care that we envision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am certain that the use of genetic information is just the tip of the iceberg. As medicine develops, so must our laws and regulations; yet, we must be careful not to stifle these promising medical advances. I am confident that we can both protect patient privacy and improve the delivery of health care as this legislation does.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I knew that we had served the American people well when the committee passed this bill and then the House passed it almost unanimously in April 2007. Now, a year later, we are on the verge of sending this important legislation to the President with overwhelming bipartisan support in both Chambers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Science and medicine have made great strides in recent years, especially with regard to genetic mapping and research. The potential for finding the answers we desperately seek for so many diseases and afflictions is greatly increased by the research being done. However, in order for these efforts to be successful, the public must be assured that these new discoveries will help and not hurt them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Science will soon be able to tell us about many more diseases that individuals are genetically predisposed to develop. That information should be used only for the public good. It must not be used by companies to pick and choose who gets insurance or who gets discriminated against. They should not be allowed to charge higher insurance premiums because of somebody's individual genetic makeup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This critical piece of legislation will protect individuals from discrimination. This is an important step that Congress is taking today, and I am very happy that we are doing this in a unified spirit. I commend Congresswomen Slaughter and Biggert for their efforts here. And I would also like to thank Chairman Miller and my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee for their work on this and so many other important issues. I urge my colleagues to vote "yes."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which will prohibit health insurers and employers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues are aware, this legislation has been around for quite some time. I have been working on for it more than 7 years, and Congresswoman Slaughter has been working on it for more than 12 years. It's been a long road, and there have been  many times I thought this day would never come; but it is here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over this period of time, I have heard stories from my constituents and other individuals across the country about how genetic information was affecting their lives. Quite simply, they are stories of how our laws have failed to keep pace with medical science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A breast cancer survivor in Chicago told me that even though her doctor recommended she undergo a genetic test to see if she had a 60 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer, which was quite common in the type of breast cancer that they had, she refused the test. She said I can't, I will lose my job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It isn't that she didn't want to know; quite the opposite. She desperately wanted to know, but she feared if she had an adverse result from the test, she would lose her job. She is not alone; studies show that 85 percent of Americans fear employers will use genetic information to discriminate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then there is the woman from Missouri whose sister had suffered from cancer was cautioned by her doctor that undergoing genetic testing would cause her to lose her health insurance. She too chose not to undergo a genetic test. She is not alone; studies show that 84 percent of Americans express concern that health insurance companies would deny coverage based on genetic information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then there is the man with a family history of PKD, decided to take a genetic test but chose to use an alias and pay cash rather than bill his insurance just to keep the test out of his medical file. And he also is not alone; 26 percent of genetic counselors themselves admit that they would use an alias and 68 percent said they would pay for the test out of their pocket to protect themselves from discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dean of a prominent university in Massachusetts told me that the fear of genetic discrimination was hindering clinical trials, slowing the development of life-saving techniques. At NIH, fear of genetic discrimination is the most common reason people cite for not participating in clinical trials on breast and colon cancers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have heard these stories over and over again from individuals wanting to know their genetic risk of developing diseases as far ranging as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Tay-Sachs, and PKD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sad fact is that these individuals are avoiding genetic tests that would empower them with the information that could save their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to let all people know that when the House passes GINA today, we will be just one step away, and that would be the signing by the President, from realizing the medical benefits of genetic testing. One step away from ensuring that people will be able to take a genetic test without risking their jobs and health insurance. One step away from ensuring that patients can stop using aliases and paying out of pocket to keep their genetic tests secret. One step away from ensuring that individuals  will be able to participate in genetic clinical trials without fear of discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the last step is the President's signature, and I am happy to say that he is expected to sign this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is clear to me that by passing GINA and freeing people from fear of genetic discrimination, we can unlock the tremendous life-saving and cost-saving potential of genetic research. More Americans will participate in genetic clinical trials, and more Americans will use these technologies to improve their health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with these improvements comes the prospect of dramatically reducing the chronic care costs that cripple our health care system. We now have more than 500 different health advocacy and business organizations supporting this bill. Recent surveys shows that 93 percent of Americans believe that employers and insurers should not be able to use genetic information to discriminate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With numbers like these, it should be no surprise that the House passed this bill last April 420-3, and the Senate passed it last week 95-0, and the President is expected to sign this measure into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have been waiting for this day for over a decade. Finally we are here, and we are about to pass <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act that we called GINA which was first introduced by Representative Slaughter in 1995 and which was approved by the Senate last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a long road, but the main sponsors of the legislation, Representative Slaughter and Representative Biggert have persevered, and I congratulate them both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be an original cosponsor of GINA which will prohibit employers from using genetic information to discriminate against workers, and will also prohibit health insurers from using such information to raise premiums or to deny coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that many States, including my home State of California, prohibits employers and health insurers from discriminating on the basis of genetic information, and that is good, but these laws vary widely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is important for the Federal Government, as it has with title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, to step forward to establish a national policy, making it clear that discriminating against workers and others based on genetic information is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this bill also contains the provisions of <bill type="h" number="2637">H.R. 2637</bill>, the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007. It was a bill I introduced last year that passed the House in June of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions in <bill type="h" number="2637">H.R. 2637</bill> will increase civil penalties from $11,000 to $50,000 for violations that cause the death or serious injury of a child worker, as if there is any penalty high enough to make up for a child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation, though, provides that a penalty can be doubled when the violation causing death or injury is repeated or willful. The child labor bill was a narrowly drafted bipartisan effort. It is a good foundation for future action on child labor laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am delighted that part of GINA includes my legislation, legislation that can be used to offset the costs of GINA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are living, Madam Speaker, in an exciting age. We have just begun to tap the potential of genetic testing. This bill adds the protection that is needed so this research can go forward and be used wisely.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of this legislation. I would like to thank all of those involved in bringing us to this point, Ms. Slaughter, Mrs. Biggert, and I especially want to mention Mark Zuckerman, Brian Kennedy, Michelle Varnhagen, and Carlos Fenwick from our staff who worked so hard on making this a reality. Thank you very much for your good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about as basic as it gets. It is a fundamental principle in this country that when you walk in and apply for a job, you shouldn't be judged on the color of your skin, your gender, your sexual orientation, your ethnicity, your age, or your religion. To that today we are adding the notion of your genetic background.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think most Americans would understand as a matter of simple common sense that if your grandmother had breast cancer, it should be irrelevant as to whether you get a job or not. If your grandfather was diabetic, it should be irrelevant as to whether you get health insurance or not, and under what terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This simple, powerful, commonsense idea that is embodied in this legislation will become embodied in the law very shortly because of the good work that is being done here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond the basic fairness, the basic principle that we should be judged by our abilities and not by our characteristics, is the point that we discussed earlier during the rule debate. Many Americans justifiably fear that if they share their genetic information with  researchers, that information may wind up hurting them. It may wind up depriving them of a job, depriving them of health insurance, or raising their health insurance premiums.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The very significant protections that are in this bill, soon to become law, will provide a level of assurance for Americans that when we participate in genetic research, as I have by donating my DNA sample to the Coriell Institute in Camden, New Jersey, that we will be protected against misuse of that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This unlocks an exhilarating potential for finding the cure for all kinds of diseases and afflictions that have hurt so many people for so long. So I believe this is a singular achievement. It is an honor to be a part of it, and I know that generations of Americans will benefit not only from the simple fairness that this law will impose in the workplace, but for the great potential that this law will unlock for the investors and inventors and researchers of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No American should ever be denied a job or health insurance or a promotion because of their genetic characteristics. Because of our actions today, this will become the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for his leadership. I thank Mrs. Biggert for her leadership and Chairwoman Slaughter as well, and urge a "yes" vote in favor of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a member of the Health Subcommittee, I thank my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, for allowing me time under his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a proud cosponsor of this bill. I am pleased to see it moving forward after more than a decade of advocacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While researchers' ability to identify genetic markers for diseases has given hope and promise to millions of people regarding how to make more informed choices about their personal behavior, the promise of this breakthrough is hindered, as many of my colleagues have said, by well-founded fears of how information may be abused in the employment and insurance industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While many states, including my own home State of New York, have laws which prohibit discrimination in health insurance, and by employers based on genetic testing and information, it is clear that the laws are not fully comprehensive and that Federal action is necessary, certainly to make it more uniform across all 50 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Fear should not be a deterrent to knowledge. Disregarding available tests for fear of discrimination prevents citizens from making smarter, personalized choices about their own well-being. We know too much to subscribe to one-size-fits-all medicine. And once again, it should be our physicians, not our insurance companies, who influence our health care decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a wonderful bill, very much overdue for enactment, years and years and years in the process. It's supported by hundreds of patient advocate groups, and will make a true impact on the health care of our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, and thank my colleague, Congresswoman Slaughter, for her tireless work term after term to support this bill and ensure that it would eventually become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past several years, genetic discoveries have progressed at a remarkable rate. Today, doctors and scientists have the ability to detect genes linked to common conditions like colon cancer and heart disease. Individuals who learn about their genetic risk factors can make lifestyle changes and begin treatments that prevent these conditions altogether.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But too many Americans don't take advantage of these amazing breakthroughs for a very practical reason. They fear that the information will be used to deny them health insurance or even a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the best way to allay those fears would be to enact universal health care coverage for all, this bill is a fantastic first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By prohibiting discrimination on the basis of our genes, this bill will improve the chances that average Americans can benefit from cutting edge genetic science. It will promote better health care by helping Americans feel secure enough to learn about their genetic risk factors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the daughter of a father who suffers from Alzheimer's and a mother who suffers from arthritis, I personally understand the need to make genetic testing a positive step in understanding one's genetic predispositions and making health care choices. Genetic testing should not be a hindrance to getting or keeping one's job or health care benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill will accomplish many great things, I want to point out just two very important ones. Number 1, it will arm people with necessary and relevant information about their own health. And Number 2, it will ensure that people won't be penalized for seeking and using this valuable information.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the completion of the human genome project 5 years ago made it possible to identify specific genes that trigger diseases later in life. However, out of at fear of losing their jobs or their health insurance, studies have shown that many Americans forego the potential health benefits of genetic testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While involved in a course at the University of Pennsylvania on genetic discrimination, the position paper Dr. Ruth Cowan's students presented to me reemphasized that this concern of genetic discrimination risks stifling further scientific advances in genetic based research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No genetic nondiscrimination laws in health care, such as in my State of Pennsylvania, may mean foregoing cures based upon genetic research. With a young daughter who underwent treatment for a malignant brain tumor recently, I understand why, as scientific technology advances, discrimination cannot grow with it, or we harm not only the quality of life, but life itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With State laws varying in how to maintain the privacy of genetic information, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act will set a national standard and take the first step toward advancing the scientific and health benefits of genetic research and protecting the genetic privacy of Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we are celebrating, or we will shortly with a vote on the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, known as GINA. And today we celebrate it with a great sense of unanimity and agreement about this legislation. But that clearly was not always true over more than the past decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has been controversial to some. It has had a shifting body of opponents to it over those many years. There are many who tried to ascribe attributes to this legislation that either wasn't intended to address or didn't exist at all. But the opposition was formidable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when we celebrate the passage of this legislation today, we must also celebrate the spirit of two women in the House of Representatives that persevered through all of the political debate, as hot it was from time to time, through all of the controversy, through much of the ignorance and misinformation about the legislation, but who, throughout that entire decade, understood the promise of this legislation,  both to those who would not be discriminated  against in the future, but also the promise in terms of medical research and information that would become available to promote, not only cures and treatment, but greater scientific understanding of the genome and our make-ups and its impact on our health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And those two women were Congresswoman Louise Slaughter from New York, and our colleague who is with us in the Chamber today, Judy Biggert from Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's one thing to stand here and say we all agree today. But that wasn't the case, and that was what they kept pushing against year after year to get the Congress to understand the importance of this legislation. We come to that understanding rather late, when you consider that many of the States have taken the steps, many Nations have taken this step, but it's terribly important that we do it so people will be assured that no worker will be discriminated against because of his or her genetic  information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, 41 States have already led the way in passing laws to prohibit discrimination to individual health insurance markets. 34 States have passed laws to prohibit employers from discriminating in the workplace. And the Federal Government has banned discrimination against Federal Government employees. Every American deserves this protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last two decades we've seen incredible scientific advances in the diagnosis and the treatment of once untreatable, undetectable conditions. Scientists now have the incredible ability to identify genetic markers for disease that could and may never occur. Genetic testing can also help prevent diseases by identifying them early.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this amazing potential of genetic testing, advancements have been stifled out of fear of what some may do with the results of those tests. Many Americans forego testing because of that fear, the fear of losing their jobs, the fear of losing their health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We pit that against the knowledge, the discovery and the treatment that would have been possible to those individuals, but the fear prevented them from coming forward. And this is not an isolated fear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2006 research study showed that 85 percent of the respondents believe that without protections, employers would use genetic information to discriminate. 64 percent believe that insurers would use the information to deny critical coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is clear. Title I of the bill prohibits group health plans and insurers from collecting or requesting genetic information with narrow exceptions. It also protects the privacy of this personal information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II of the bill prohibits employers from collecting or using their employees' genetic information. It also prohibits employers from discriminating against employees in hiring, firing and other terms of conditions of employment based upon the genetic information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This final bill makes it clear that, even though employers may not be held accountable for violations committed by health plans under title I, employers remain fully liable for any violations of title II, including violations involving health benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is well settled in this country's employment discrimination laws, such as title VII, the Age Discrimination Employment Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees in their health benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We intend for the courts to continue to interpret employer obligations under GINA similarly to all other civil rights laws. GINA will protect workers like David Escher, a former worker at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, who discovered his employer was trying to prove his injury was caused by a genetic disorder rather than work-related injury. This is precisely the type of discrimination and misuse of genetic information that we seek to prohibit in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The protections provided by GINA are long overdue, and Representatives Slaughter and Biggert have fought, over this last decade, for these important changes, these important provisions in the law. And I want to thank them for all of their hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to take a moment to thank the members of my staff, Michelle Varnhagen, Mark Zuckerman, Brian Kennedy, Jody Calemine and Michael Gaffin for all of their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Congressman Andrews' staff, Carlos Fenwick.</paragraph>

And legislative counsel, Ed Grossman, Larry Johnson and Henry Christrup, for all of their assistance and all of the effort that they put in to making the changes and the distinctions between the actions in the House and the Senate, and all of the controversy that this brought with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time so that Ms. Biggert may make her closing remarks. And again, I want to thank her so much. Her membership on our committee makes us very proud. And her political toughness to see this through to the end, along with Louise Slaughter, is a wonderful story that we celebrate also with the passage of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your kind words. And it's been a long road, but we're here, and with your help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just let me say that there's three benefits that are so important for this bill. Number one is that people will get a genetic test. And if it shows that they have a propensity for having some disease, they can then take preventive measures and take measures that are going to improve the quality of their life. And it's personalized medicine. People have got to take command of their medical lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second of all, because people will take preventive measures, this is going to reduce the cost of health care. It's going to reduce the cost to businesses because their employees will be taking these preventive measures, and it's going to reduce the cost to health care providers because people, again, will be taking these measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as I said before, through the clinical trials, it will increase the ability to find cures for so many diseases if people get into these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, I would really like to take a moment to thank Representative Slaughter, Chairman Slaughter of the Rules Committee one more time, Greg Walden of Oregon who has been a major sponsor of this bill, Congressman Andrews of New Jersey, who has been so helpful, and Mrs. Eshoo from California, who has been so involved. And then Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for all their hard work on this issue. It's  truly been a pleasure to work with all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Mr. McKeon and Mr. Miller again, the chairman and ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee, for all their support. And then the other chairmen, Congressman Dingell and Congressman Barton of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Mr. Upton of Michigan for coming down and working on this today. And then Chairman Rangel and ranking member McCrery of the Ways and Means Committee, and then Representative</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been so supportive of this legislation. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Sharon Terry and the Coalition for Genetic Fairness, as well as all of our other organizational supporters, for all their persistence and their expertise on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Dr. Francis Collins of NIH for his testimony before all three committees in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Finally, I have to thank the staff, all of the staff, who worked so tirelessly for years now behind the scenes on our behalf and put in long, long hours on this legislation. And in particular, my thanks go to Michelle Varnhagen and Jim Paretti from the Education and Labor Committee staff, and then Michelle Adams from Ms. Slaughter's staff, and Brian Peterson of my staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's so many reasons why everybody should vote for this, and certainly having passed the House by 420-3 last April and the Senate 95-0, you say, This is a no-brainer; why didn't this happen a long time ago? And what's been alluded to is to get three committees in the House of Representatives to work on all of the issues, and they are so technical in how they relate to each other and how it relates to privacy and the other HIPAA and ADA and all of the things that had to be brought in here,  I think everyone works so hard just to have a wonderful result. And it's no surprise that we're here, but it just took a long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would urge all my colleagues to vote for this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Congresswoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER for her outstanding leadership on this issue. For 13 years, she has worked to pass this bill protect Americans from genetic discrimination. She's both the powerful chair of the Rules Committee, and a microbiologist, so she knows what she is talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sequencing of the human genetic code is one of the great scientific accomplishments in the history of the world. It has the potential to treat and prevent disease. It is evidence of science's almost-biblical power to heal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But with this scientific breakthrough comes a responsibility to protect Americans from the misuse of their genetic information. Today, the Congress will begin to fulfill that responsibility by passing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation prevents health insurers from adverse coverage or pricing decisions based on a person's genetic predisposition toward a disease. It ensures an employer cannot make adverse employment decisions based on what is in a person's genetic code. It also makes it illegal for an insurer or employer to request or demand a gene test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of this legislation, Americans will be free to undergo genetic testing for diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, without fearing for their job or health insurance. There is life-saving information in those tests. And for scientists, there is information that allows for huge breakthroughs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by the vast majority of the American people, 93 percent of whom do not want employers to have access to their genetic information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is such good policy that this legislation is supported by more than 500 organizations, including a broad coalition of civil rights and religious organizations. Health advocacy groups ranging from the American Academy of Pediatrics to the March of Dimes to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation have endorsed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Congress, it has broad bipartisan support. It also has the support of the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us not wait another day to pass this legislation so it can move to the President's desk for his signature and become law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act. This bill is the product of 10 years of hard work by my colleague Ms. SLAUGHTER and I applaud her for her efforts to pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sequencing of the human genome was an amazing scientific advancement, and has contributed to the rise of genetic testing to inform patients of their proclivity for disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to genetic testing, individuals with a risk of an illness can take precautionary steps ahead of time to ward off disease, which will contribute to lower health care costs over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, it is critical that we protect individuals from any discrimination that could result from the information these tests reveal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The results should not be used by health insurers to deny anyone coverage or increase their premiums because of a pre-disposition to a certain disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the results should not be used by employers to discriminate against employees based on their predisposition to disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of this bill will encourage individuals to seek genetic testing if they so desire without fear of losing their health insurance and give them the ability to seek early medical treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One segment of the health care marketplace was excluded from the bill's protections--the long-term care insurance market. This bill was never intended to regulate the long-term care insurance market, and I understand that current statute treats long-term care insurance differently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, individuals that determine that they are at high-risk for developing Alzheimer's disease will undoubtedly begin planning for their long-term care and probably purchase long-term care insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite all of the good intentions in this legislation, the bill would allow long-term care insurance underwriters to refuse to cover or charge individuals predisposed to such disease higher premiums for a disease they have yet to develop and may never develop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward, Congress should ensure that future legislation extends the patient protections inherent in this bill to consumers who want to plan for their future and purchase long-term care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I am pleased to support this important legislation and send this bill to the President.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which extends crucial Federal protections against discrimination based on an individual's genetic information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new millennium has seen unprecedented scientific advances in genetic research that have brought a renewed hope of solving today's most difficult medical puzzles. Since the human genome was fully mapped in 2003, many in the scientific and medical communities have viewed genetic medicine as the next step toward finding better diagnoses, treatments and possible cures for a wide spectrum of diseases. These advances have also raised legitimate ethical concerns about the potential misuse of genetic  information in workforce and insurance related decisions. Although current law already addresses certain aspects of this issue, the importance of protecting individuals from discrimination and safeguarding the right to privacy cannot be overstated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will guarantee more comprehensive protections from discrimination in health insurance and employment on the basis of genetic information. Specifically, it will prohibit group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to develop a disease in the future. Furthermore, it bars employers, employment agencies, labor organizations or training programs from using an individual's  genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement or promotion decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Genetics is a field of study that offers tremendous promise for medical advancement, but we must give thoughtful consideration to the implications of these emerging discoveries on society. No individual should fear discrimination based on genetic technologies. <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill> will allay concerns about the potential for discrimination, encourage individuals to participate in genetic research, and take advantage of genetic testing, new technologies, and new therapies. I thank Congresswoman Slaughter  for her leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, GINA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 13 years--this bill will finally make its way to the President's desk, to help protect families from genetic discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to the Congresswoman from New York, Ms. Slaughter, for her work in drafting this bill and guiding it through the cumbersome referral to three committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, with Chairman Dingell, Ms. DeGette and Mr. Smith, we were able to include an important provision to protect families from unfair treatment on the basis of the genetic material of their fetuses or children in the process of adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this bill, families may face genetic information discrimination from testing of embryos and fetuses, as well as children who are in the process of adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As genetic testing becomes increasingly common, these provisions will ensure that genetic material gathered through pre-implementation genetic diagnoses, amniocentesis, or other future techniques is not used to limit families' access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Ms. Slaughter for her commitment to reflect these changes throughout the bill in order to avoid any further confusion as to whether or not families can be discriminated against on the basis of the genetic material of their unborn child or child under consideration for adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to work with many Members to include this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. I would like to thank my good friends and colleagues, Representative LOUISE SLAUGHTER and Representative JUDY BIGGERT, for their tireless advocacy to bring this bill to the House floor today and then on to the White House for President Bush's signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing more personal and more deserving of protection than the genetic make-up of each and every individual in our Nation. Advances in science and technology during the past decade have allowed us to map the human genome and opened the doors to treatment and diagnostic capabilities that we are only now beginning to realize. With this power comes great responsibility to protect individuals who learn that they may be more susceptible to diseases such as breast cancer or mental illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as our Nation does not allow discrimination based on race or disability, we must not allow discrimination based on our own genetic identity. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act will prevent health insurers and employers from improperly using our genetic information to make coverage or employment decisions. I urge my colleagues to support this protection of our most basic human right by voting for <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation is long overdue. Recent scientific breakthroughs in sequencing the human genetic code have already transformed the battle against a broad range of medical conditions. Scientists have now identified genetic markers for a variety of chronic health conditions which will increase the potential for early treatment and prevention. However, as much as these advances will improve health care delivery in this country, it has increased the potential for employers and insurers  to discriminate based on an individual's genetic makeup. Such a threat deters the public and science from taking full advantage of the life-saving and cost-saving potential of genetic research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That why we need to pass this much-needed bill. Discriminating against someone because of their DNA is simply unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, I urge colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation so that Americans do not have to live in fear of losing their job or health insurance because of their genetic predisposition towards certain medical conditions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The identification of genetic markers for disease is one of the most remarkable scientific accomplishments we have made. And this ability to identify risks for certain conditions holds so much promise for our ability to identify and practice greater preventive health care in this country. I can never emphasize enough just how important preventive health care is to our well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as with almost all great scientific advancements, we have also opened the door to a whole slew of unintended consequences. And I fear that preventive health care is put at risk when patients decline genetic testing for fear of insurance or employment discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill before us will put aside those fears by offering protection from employment discrimination and closes the loopholes that deter individuals from pursuing information that can save their lives and the lives of others. After all, the biomedical research community is in dire need of greater clinical trial participation. But many patients are wary because they worry that participation in a clinical trial will reveal a genetic predisposition that employers or insurers can use as a basis for  discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill> will provide individuals the security of knowing that they can take advantage of genetic testing and participate in research without the fear that their employment or insurance status be put at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleagues LOUISE SLAUGHTER, JUDY BIGGERT and ANNA ESHOO for their tireless work on this bill over the last 13 years. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="493">H.R. 493</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412259" topic="MOTION OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress today is making an important first step toward protecting Americans from discrimination based on their genetic information. I support this bill and the premise that a predisposition to disease should never be a factor in access to employment or insurance coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, this is only a first step. I am compelled to remind this House, and all Americans, that this bill does not guarantee genetic information will not be abused by employers or insurers. The passage of this legislation should not give consumers a false sense of security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until access to health care is available regardless of current or future health conditions, the potential for genetic discrimination will remain. And until we completely limit access to employee health records, there will be the potential for discrimination by employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, passage of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act today is a strong step toward protecting sensitive genetic information, but no journey is completed in just one step. I look forward to addressing the underlying problems not fixed by this bill so we can truly protect Americans' privacy and guard against discrimination based on preexisting health conditions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The scientific advancement that has been made in sequencing the human genome is groundbreaking. We have only just begun to understand how we can harness the vast amount of information that is included in our genetic code to benefit human health and longevity. The ability to predict disease will greatly increase our opportunities for early treatment and prevention efforts and this can have a real impact on people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am proud to support the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. This bill will provide strong protections to prevent employers and insurers from denying health coverage or job opportunities on the basis of predictive genetic information. Providing this protection will ensure that Americans are not unfairly penalized, either by health insurers or by employers, for something that is a part of their genetic makeup. In addition, these protections will encourage individuals to participate  in genetic research, which will lead to new technologies and new therapies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important nondiscrimination protection is necessitated by the advancements in science, like the mapping of the human genome. And Congress is responsible for making sure that our laws keep up with these scientific advancements, so that we can fully realize the value of these discoveries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of it.</paragraph>
