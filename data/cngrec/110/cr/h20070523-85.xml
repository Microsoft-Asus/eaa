  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from California (Mr. Bilbray) is recognized for 55 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chance to speak before the House today, and it's about an issue that many Americans all over this Nation are discussing, are listening about, and, frankly, are very concerned, if not outraged, and that is the proposal before the Senate this week that would actually not only allow, but demand amnesty for 12- to 20 million illegal immigrants in this country while millions wait patiently outside to immigrate into our country legally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight I am honored to be able to have colleagues here to be able to address the issues and actually talk about what's going on in their districts and address the issue that where does America go from here? How do we stop the Senate from making this terrible mistake? How do we turn the President and the Senate away from the path of amnesty that was followed in 1986, which caused the greatest influx of illegal immigration? How do we get the elite here in Washington to wake up to the fact that  you do not stop illegal immigration by announcing to the world that you are now going to reward up to 20 million people who are illegally in the country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the privilege to recognize the gentleman from Texas at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from California for recognizing me on this very important issue to the people of the United States of America, the opening of our borders and the pouring in of somewhere between 12- to 20 million people who have broken the laws of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk a little tonight about what's going on in my district and what's going on in Texas and what's going on in the country. But, first, I would like to respond to some talk that took place in the last hour, just for a second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we talk about gasoline prices, you know, all this talk about gasoline prices, I saw in this last hour, they kept trying to say all this was President Bush's fault. The Democrats are in charge of Congress. They have told us tomorrow that they are an equal branch of government, and that they are, in fact, in charge of this Nation at this time, and they are responsible for these gas prices. It's time to be responsible to go along with your rights. The Democrat majority has something they can  do about gas prices, but, of course, let's look at what they have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first thing they did in Six for '06 was take away the incentives to encourage domestic drilling and, in fact, place a tax on gas production, and, thus, decrease the availability of American petroleum to replace our burden on foreign petroleum. They proposed a cut-and-run theory on dealing with the issue in Iraq, which, if we cut and run, would turn over the second largest oil reserve in the world to Islamic terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They propose now, out of the Senate, to open our borders to the illegal aliens that are already here and to put together a policy which would encourage more illegal aliens to come across our borders and consume 20 million people's worth of oil and gas in this country. These are the things that they are criticizing the Republican minority for causing the gas prices to go up?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that all just gives you a picture of where we are going right now. Now the Democrats have come out of the Senate, remember, they are the majority in the Senate, too, and they have come out with a proposal to, they say, solve our immigration crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say, and I have told this to the White House, and I have told it to my colleagues here in Congress, and I tell them again, the American people want a solution to the illegal immigrant problem. That's where they see and know the crisis is, and they are saying you have the tools and have had the tools to do something about this problem for a long time, over 20 years, and nothing has been done. The American people see this as a crisis, and they are right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, for 20 years I sat on the bench as a district judge in Texas. When people broke the law, the people of our country, in Williamson County, Texas, they wanted the laws enforced. They called upon our sheriffs and our law enforcement officers to enforce the law, and they called upon our courts and our juries to enforce the law. I am proud to say we did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue is a law enforcement issue as much as any other issue. There are between 12- and 20 million people in this country, we are told by some, came here to start a new life. You don't start a new life by breaking the law, and the American people know that. The American people want something done about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want us to defend our sovereign borders of the United States and to tell these people, you cannot break the laws of the United States and then expect to come into this country and get the benefits and the privileges of being a United States citizen. They are unhappy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Senate bill was announced, I believe it was last Friday, before the end of the day and into Monday, we had over 1,000 phone calls, an estimation. I know we had over 400, I think it was, right here in D.C. Then our other two offices were overwhelmed with phone calls, all from citizens who we, you know, who are people of our community, who live and work in our community, and every one of them said this is an outrage. Do not support this concept of amnesty for people who have broken our  laws. They have to be responsible for their own behavior. We raise our children to be responsible for their behavior, and we expect them to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We tell the American citizens, we set up a series of laws, we call it the rule of law. It is a basic principle of the Republic of the United States that the people respect the rule of law. Without it, democracy and the Republic cannot function. Yet we have proposed a bill that will waive the rule of law for up to 20 million or possibly more than 20 million people that are in this country illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's just not right, that's just basically old country boy not right to the folks back in Texas and to the folks, I believe, across this Nation. They get up  every day, and they abide by the laws of the United States. They pay their taxes. They do the right thing for the right reasons because that's what Americans do. That's the kind of people we want in the country, people who abide by the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To just say that it's a good way to start a new part of our population by letting them break the law to become part of our Nation, it just flies in the face of everything America thinks is right. We hear the argument, we are sure they are good people. I am sure they are good people. They are hard-working people. I have lived in Texas all my life, and I have seen this phenomena all my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are hard-working people. I have visited with many of them in my limited Spanish and find them to be people looking for a job and who are hard-working. But it doesn't change the fact that they are starting their life in the United States of America illegally. This is wrong, and the American people know it's wrong.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="">
    <paragraph>One of the things, I think, people misunderstand when they talk about the amnesty, that people that are here illegally working in the United States are not just violating immigration law. A lot of people don't realize that about 73 to 75 percent of everyone who is here illegally is working illegally because they acquired false documents, stole somebody's ID or identification to work, which is a felony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kennedy proposal in the Senate not only gives amnesty, an exemption from prosecution, for being illegally in the country, but exempts them and gives amnesty for the felony they committed when they used somebody else's identification or used false documentation to acquire a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have got to remember that we are not only giving amnesty for immigration, we are now proposing that we will pick a certain population to be exempt from a felony violation and not only forgiven for that violation, but to be given a special program, the Z visa, that only those who have broken the law qualify for. Those individuals who have been waiting patiently to immigrate into this country illegally are not allowed, under this proposal, to have the Z option, to go for the Z visa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a concept of rewarding illegal behavior, a little felony illegal behavior, when you are telling those who have not broken our laws that you are not going to offer them the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Absolutely. And you hit on a very good point, and I thank the gentleman for yielding. The point that you hit on is that there are people that are trying to do it the right way, that have been waiting patiently to do this the right way in countries around this world; not just from our neighbors to the south, but all over this world that have waited patiently to get the opportunity to come to the United States, following the rules in the effort to go to work, enjoying the freedom of  the world we live in, and ultimately by doing the right thing, the right way, hopefully become American citizens.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time. I am chairman of the Immigration Caucus, and I am proud that my mother is an immigrant, a legal immigrant. She came here, played by the rules; and, as she reminds me again and again, it is an insult to her and everyone else who played by the rules to gain legal status in this country to watch anybody, let alone the Senate of the United States, announce to the world that they are going to give up to 20 million people the cherished ability to live permanently in  the United States and to give them a vehicle towards citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I have the honor to yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for taking on the task of serving as chairman of our Immigration Caucus. I appreciate the leadership that you have given to it and I appreciate the comments that you and Congressman Carter have made tonight. I have several points I would like to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The members of our caucus know that I am very keen on the use of language, and that language makes a big difference. And we keep hearing over and over from the supporters of this Senate bill that this is not amnesty. But I think it is important that we define the word "amnesty," so I looked it up under dictionary.com unabridged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first definition: a general pardon for offenses, especially political offenses against the government, often granted before any trial or conviction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then I like this one, another one from Online Etymology Dictionary: pardon of past offenses, intentional overlooking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is what we are talking about here. And, again, I think it is important that we define what we are talking about. That is exactly what the Senate is proposing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the other thing that I want to say is that I am really concerned with the way this bill has come out. It is being debated in pieces. It was written in secret, sprung on us late in the day, and it didn't go through a committee structure as most of our bills do. It was brought straight to the floor of the Senate. The leadership of the Senate, the Democratic leadership of the Senate wanted to cram it through before the Memorial Day holiday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those kinds of actions are not the actions of people who are proud of what they are doing. If they were proud of this bill, they would have brought that bill to a committee, they would have debated it, they would have heard the arguments pro and con, and then they would have come up with something that was discussed openly with lots and lots of people. That is the way, as Congressman Carter says, our Republic operates. We don't operate in secret. We don't do things like that. We don't  cram bills through in a hurry, especially when they are so controversial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, you mentioned, we want to talk a little bit about our districts. I live in, I think, the most beautiful area of the world, the Fifth District of North Carolina. I am very blessed to live there. And I live among, I think, the brightest, hardest-working people in the world. And they are very intelligent, very conscientious, very patriotic people. They are upset about this proposal. They don't like it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since I came to Congress a little over 2 years ago, I have been telling everybody who would listen, this is the biggest issue in my district, it is the biggest issue in most districts. And why? Because the American people, and again particularly the people in my district, have played by the rules and they understand the importance of the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tell folks over and over what makes this country so special are three things: the rule of law, our moral underpinnings, and our capitalistic way of life. But you can't have moral underpinnings and you can't have the capitalistic system if you don't have the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we can do something about illegal aliens who are here in our country. People say, oh, we can't do anything about them. We surely can. What we can do is start enforcing our laws. We have not been doing that. Both Democratic and Republican administrations are guilty of it. I can't forgive our Republican administrations because they are guilty of it, too. But we can close down our borders and we can enforce the laws as they are now. And I think that what we have to do is we have to look at  this issue of illegal immigration in a very careful, law-respecting way. The solution doesn't lie in wholesale amnesty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the President has said that this bill will treat people with respect. Well, I respect the President, but I have to strongly disagree with him. Because from what I have seen so far, this bill fails to respect the millions of people who have worked within the system and have immigrated to our country legally. And those people who want to come to this country legally, they are doing it the right way. These people have done it the wrong way. We are not going to reward, we cannot reward illegal  behavior by uttering platitudes about respect and fairness. Our first principle on immigration reform has to be upholding American laws. If we do not do that, then our system will be fundamentally flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that the Senate is proposing is going to legalize these people immediately. They talk about triggers being in there, but the triggers don't really go into effect. And the triggers are nothing but laws that we have already had in place for a long, long time. And if this bill passes and is signed by the President, we will be, I think, doing severe damage to our country, not just in the short run, because I think that it  will be both in the short  run and in the long run. There will be a huge battle ahead of us if we pass this bill, because we are going to be facing more and more illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, as I said before, the people of the Fifth District are very bright people. They know amnesty when they see it, and they know that if this bill or something even vaguely like it passes, it is going to dilute the meaning of citizenship in this country, and that is the last thing we want to do. We are the last best hope for freedom in this world; and if we don't enforce our laws and help people come here legally who want to come here, and deal with things on a case-by-case basis, we  are simply going to destroy what it is that is wonderful about our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Bilbray mentioned that his mother was an immigrant but came here legally. My father's parents came from Italy in the early 1900s; my mother's ancestors came much earlier than that from Scotland. But the Ellis Island model was a very, very good model. People had to come here, prove that they were healthy, prove that they either had a job or had a sponsor for them to be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That worked wonderfully well in this country for a long, long time. And think that we have to have something akin to the Ellis Island experience again in this country, where we know that the people who are coming here are coming here because we need them here or they provide a benefit and they can be independent. They will not have to have public assistance.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I may reclaim my time. I think the one thing we don't talk about enough in this country is that there is this perception that we don't allow very much legal immigration inside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States today, Mr. Speaker, accepts more legal immigration than all the rest of the world combined. We are accepting more legal immigration today than at any other time in the history of our Republic. This country is one of the most gracious and welcoming countries, the most welcoming country in the history of the world. And so we have nothing to apologize for when it comes to accommodating, except for the fact that we made a terrible mistake in 1986.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you were talking about the definition of amnesty, it actually comes from the Latin word for amnesia. And maybe what the Senate is forgetting in having this amnesia is what happened the last time they proposed this type of amnesty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Let's just look at what happened when Mr. Kennedy, who promised in 1986 this would be the last amnesty that America would ever have, clearly stated, "It will never happen again."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty years ago, we tried this experiment of rewarding illegal immigration. We were promised that it was only going to be 1 million illegals that were given amnesty. It turned out it was 3 million. Now, 20 years later, rather than having 3 illegals in our country we have 12 to 20. Mr. Kennedy, did your amnesty really eliminate illegal immigration?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell you as somebody who was down at the border, I was actually the chairman of San Diego County on the border, a county of 3 million. The greatest influx of illegal immigration that we have seen in this country happened immediately after the last amnesty. And anyone who says that we are going to stop illegal immigration by announcing to the world that 20 million illegals got rewarded is either ignorant of the facts or willing to fabricate verifications that are absolutely outrageous.  And you cannot stop illegal immigration when you announce that you are going to reward it, and the proof is in history. Last time, Mr. Kennedy, you did this, we had the largest illegal immigration population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, frankly, I think there are people who are proposing this amnesty who know what it will do but will not come clean with the American people. And I think the one thing we saw this week, and I think all of us will agree, is that the elite in Washington think that the American people don't understand this issue. Well, the American people understood it. Within 45 minutes after Mr. Kennedy and the Senators were doing their press conference, the American people started making phone calls,  they started e-mailing, they started faxing. They sent a signal to the Senators and they sent a signal to us that, Washington, we are watching and we are not going to fall for it this time. We are going to stand up and defend our grandchildren's birthright, and we are going to start demanding that you start doing the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think the guilt goes both ways. The public is fed up with the Republicans and Democrats, because they have not seen an administration enforce the law. We have to gain credibility that we really can be trusted with the security of this country by being willing to do the right thing and enforce the immigration laws here. And not until we do that, no matter who is President, no matter what party is in power, will the American public trust us to move on with a lot of other agendas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just want to ask one question. I think that you have touched on a very important point again, and that is that we here in the House of Representatives are the Representatives of the people. We are the people's House. And I think the Senate is completely out of touch with what the sentiment is in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I agree with you, the American people get it. The people of my district get it, and they are very, very bright. I think that we need to be listening to those people. And the House generally does listen to the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I hope that they are going to send a very, very strong message to the Senators about how they feel about this, and turn this around in the Senate, because we need this bill to be killed in the Senate and not even come to the House of Representatives to be debated. But I know that we as Republicans are going to have some alternatives that we will be presenting in this House, and I hope that the majority party, which has made so many promises, none of which it has kept in this session of the  Congress, will listen to the people and say, we are going to take up legislation that will do what needs to be done, which is protect our borders and provide for national security and give the people a true immigration reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. And actually, I guess we've got to remember that 11 months ago, I was standing exactly where you are and gave my acceptance speech for being sworn into Congress. And there were 18 candidates for the 50th District in California. And the people of San Diego wanted to send a clear message to Washington that this illegal immigration issue is something that people need to address. And I think today you're hearing not just one district scream loud and clear that they  want the illegal immigration issue addressed, but you're seeing people calling from all the districts, calling their Representatives and demanding that we finally do the right thing and not sell out on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like yield to the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>And I thank the gentleman for yielding. And you mentioned that your wife came here as an immigrant, and my wife came here as an immigrant also. And I'd like to share just a little bit of our story because I think it gives us a good comparison to what's being proposed in the Senate today and what we used to operate under in this country when you do it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very blessed to the fact that my wife, Erica, fell in love with a law student from the University of Texas law school back in 1965. And I happen to humbly be that law student. And we married in 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to be very honest, I really never even thought about the fact that my wife might have to actually apply to come to the United States after she had married a red-blooded American. You know, I thought that was just the ticket, but quickly found out that wasn't the ticket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had to go down to the embassy, and we had to fill out all these papers. We had to have someone pledge $5,000 to ensure that she would have a sponsor who would take care of her when, if she was allowed to enter the United States and ultimately get a green card to be a resident alien of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had to take a physical, and as she took a physical with several other women her age, one of whom looked very much like her, when they got the lung exams back, this is a personal  thing that happened to us, they came to us and said, I'm sorry, but our exam of your wife's X-Rays shows that she's got tuberculosis, and she may not enter the United States, which we were newly married. We hadn't even been married a month at that time, maybe a month and  a half. We were crushed. And then the doctor came back and said, I'm sorry, we got the wrong X-Ray. This is something we will never forget. And unfortunately, that X-Ray was for another redheaded girl who was in the same physical group that had their physicals, and so I felt very sorry for her, who was also marrying an American, but she was not going to be allowed to come to the United States because she had tuberculosis. But, praise God, it wasn't my wife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we paid our fee. We took our physical examination, we had the background check which is required for all people coming into the United States, and then when we arrived in the United States, in those days every year you had to register with the Federal Government. Every person who was not a citizen but had a green card, between January 1 and January 31 you went down to the post office and you filled out a form every year and told the United States Government where you were if you were a green  card holder in the United States. We don't have that provision anymore. It went away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did all those things. My wife learned American history. She learned the English language. In the meantime, she had three American children, but she still met all the qualifications that you had to have to get to be an American citizen. And in 1976, I was very proud to see my wife raise her right hand and take the oath of allegiance to the United States of America and become a United States citizen. And I am proud of her for many, many reasons, and that's one of them today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's how you do it to do it right, to do it legally, and to become part of what this mysterious wonder that is America. It's not to sneak across a border in the middle of the night and hide out as a lawbreaker to make money. That's not the way you're supposed to come into the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as you pointed out, we have a procedure where people legally come here by the millions, and we welcome them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me point one more thing out, and then I'm going to yield back, and that is here about a month ago we had about, I don't know, looked like several hundred people walking around this building with T shirts on that said "Legalize the Irish." And I stopped some of them in the elevator and said, what in the world does that mean? And they said, well, we're all here illegally, and we want to be made legal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an Hispanic issue. This is an issue for the people who came to Disneyland and never went home. This is the people from all over the world that have overstayed their visas and are staying in the United States, as well as those who come across our borders. They are just as big starting life as a lawbreaker as people who swam the Rio Grande or walked across the desert of Arizona or California or New Mexico in the middle of the night. This is something that is not the right way to become  an American citizen, and we can do better than this, and we must. And I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time. I mean, the American people are such a patient, humanitarian people that maybe sometimes we forget there's a fine line between being the nice guy and being a patsy. My mother immigrated from Australia. She got her citizenship, and she's very proud that she was one of the first Australian war brides to get her citizenship, April 1946. And when she sees that there are not only illegals in the country saying they want to be legalized, they want amnesty, what shocks  her is that the United States allows people to be here illegally and demand, demand that America change its laws to accommodate them because they do not want to play by the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What other Nation on Earth would allow people to be illegally in their country and then demand that their duly elected representative government modify its statutes to accommodate them because they do not want to be bothered by following the laws of their host country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What kind of relationship do we expect to come from a situation to where we accommodate people who come to this country illegally, while we tell those patiently that want to come here legally, sorry, you get put on the back of the list?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, you know, I'm very impressed. Learning a new language is always a big challenge, and your wife did that. My wife didn't immigrate from a foreign country. She came from New Orleans, and we're still trying to understand some of the things she says. My mother immigrated from Australia, and the Australians are going to have to learn English someday themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think the real sad fact is that there are actually people that think that there's some good that can come out of this not only for America, but for the immigrants and immigrants around the world if we think breaking the law is now going to be a standard. If you want to live in a country where their law is bought and sold and shifted around by politicians just for political expediency, there's a lot of countries you can go to. Those countries tend to be poor, downtrodden, and poverty-stricken,  and, by the way, happen to be the places that a lot of these illegal immigrants are coming</paragraph>
    <paragraph>from. But why transfer that corruption from those Third World countries into this country and destroy the mother's milk of freedom, the concept of the rule of law, while at the same time you're saying that the economic backbone of freedom, the middle class, is expendable at the same time?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, there are people that try to accommodate illegal immigration to such a point that this bill that the Senate is proposing will say that an illegal alien qualifies for in-State tuition, even though a United States citizen doesn't qualify. And this really hits me personally, because in the State of California, where I have been a resident since the day I was born, I have paid taxes my entire adult life, I was told that my children, to get in-State tuition, I had to show a personal tax return.  But somebody that they suspect is an illegal alien doesn't have to show their personal records; they just have to show utility bills. And when I said, I'll show you my utility bills, I'll show you all the way back to the '70s; oh, excuse me, sir, you don't qualify because we don't think you're illegal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if the American people think this is just about illegals and just about, you know, 12- to 20 million, they've got to remember that they are going to be put in a position of having to prove more than somebody who is illegally in this country; that American citizens will become second-class citizens to those who are not even citizens and not even legal. This is how absurd this line goes if you follow Mr. Kennedy off the edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And remember, this is the same man, in 1986, that said no more amnesties anymore. I guarantee it. That is a sad state of affairs that the American people are facing, that same big lie, 20 years later. And it's time we say no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I'm so proud, I am so proud to be an American, knowing that the American people called those Senators, e-mailed them, faxed them and wrote them to where the Senate, rather than trying to cram this through this week, were forced to back off and give some time. And now this next week the American people will have more time to read the fine print, read about things like in-State tuition and loans to illegal aliens, and read about what is really in this bill and how bad it really is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I'd like to yield back to the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>And I thank the gentleman for yielding. There are a lot of interesting things in this bill that common sense tells you that nobody's thinking about this. I'll just give one example. They have told us that there are people that have been waiting legally, and they're going to make sure that these illegals will get behind those people, and it will take approximately 8 years to process these people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I just sat down and looked at it. If you take the people that are in the pipeline right now, and I don't remember the number, but it's a couple of million, I think, and we're going to process them over 8 years to get them processed in doing it the right way, these are people doing it the right way, and I can tell you this, I know this for a fact. The last time I checked, which was about 3 months ago, those people we were helping who were doing it  right  processed their papers through the San Antonio office, which is where, our part of Texas, I live just north of Austin, San Antonio office, they were still working on 1999 and 2000. They may be up to halfway to 2001 right now. So they're 7 or 8 years behind. So they got the number right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now they're going to tell us that they're going to take 12 million and instantly process them for a Z visa. About 18 months they say it'll take. So that tells you right off that the standards have got to be different. They have to be different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I was asking questions of someone who seemed to have some knowledge of the bill, and he said, well, you take a full handprint, you run it through all the criminal records, and you find out whether they've got a criminal record. Well, if that's so easy, why is the number one answer that we get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service when we call them, why are we delayed, FBI's got to do background checks? These things are extensive. They take a long time. Wait a minute. Take a full  handprint and run it through the records. That's what we're told we're going to for these Z visas. That's not enough for the legal people, but it seems to be enough for the illegal people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How about the fact that we've got diseases south of our southern border which are incurable, like a strain of tuberculosis? Shouldn't everybody that's here have a medical check? Where is it? Is it going to be there? It doesn't sound like it is.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>So, you know, I think there was some good-hearted people tried, but they tried miserably on this bill. The American people want to take our time and do this right. And right now their concern, if you ask them, you don't hear them say, I want new immigration policy. You hear them say, I want the illegal immigration problem stopped, which means pour the resources to the border, pour the resources to law enforcement, enforce the laws that are on the books. And then when the American people say,  you know what, we can trust our government again to enforce the law, that's when they will be willing to say, now let's work with coming up with alternatives to make this whole thing work. And we can do it right the next time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the wrong bill, the wrong time and, as Ms. Foxx pointed out, shoved down our throat by the Democrat majority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Congressman, you hit on the real point. In a Republic where the governed get to choose the government, trust is an essential component. And there isn't any trust in the American people when it comes to the Federal Government enforcing our immigration laws. There isn't any credibility in the Federal Government when it comes to stopping illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people believe, and rightfully so, that special interests manipulate the Federal Government to stop illegal immigration from being controlled in the past, and that unless they really scream loud and start holding elected officials accountable at the polling box, that they are going to continue to have that type of corruption delivered to them when it comes to the immigration issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to just say clearly, a lot of people say why am I feeling so strong on this concept of amnesty? Why can't we just do it one more time? Let me tell you something. I have talked to people south of the border and in Third World countries all over the world. And if people would take the time to listen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To give an example, a congressman in Zacatecas, Mexico, a Mexican congressman, says to me, Look, BRIAN, you know you have got to educate these people because we all down here know you are going to give amnesty again. They are all going to be U.S. citizens. Why do you think they are coming up illegally? They know you are going to reward them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You go down to places like Central America. They say, Look, we are told come on up now. America is going to give us amnesty. We are going to become citizens. The way to America is come illegal. That message is being heard around the world. We need to send a clear and defined message that says no more amnesty, no more rewards for illegal behavior. You want to be an American? You follow the law and play by the rules. If you are not willing to do it, we will never give amnesty again. And, believe  me, if we send that clear message, if we stop this amnesty, people around world will finally understand, no, it is no longer the option to come here illegally. You have got to play by the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then and only then will we see the ability to control not just our border; but our neighborhoods, our jobs, our parks, our hospitals, our schools, are finally going to be ours, and those that we choose to be our neighbors, not somebody who snuck in and stole away in the middle of the night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so honored to stand here today with you, sir. I appreciate the hard work that you have given the people of Texas and your district, and I look forward to working with you to make sure that we present a workable, enforceable immigration policy that will stop illegal immigration and not allow this proposal in the Senate to move in and allow another illegal immigration wave being caused by another ill-fated amnesty scheme. Thank you very much.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield, I am very honored to appear here with you, Mr. Chairman, with all the great work you are doing on the Immigration Caucus trying to come up with a solution to this illegal immigration in this country. I salute you and all of our colleagues who join you in this effort to come up with reasonable solutions for a very difficult problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to join you in saying to the world, we are asking the rule of law to prevail. It's very simple. This Nation was built on the rule of law. Let the rule of law prevail. And the rule of law does show compassion on the poor and the downtrodden, but it has to exist or they have no protection. And if we start to tear down the rule of law, it is going to be as harmful to those who are downtrodden and poor as it is to the richest man in the world because the rule of law is the basis of our Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I reach out to the Hispanic community who feels like this is targeted to them and say, no, it is targeted to all who come into our country illegally. I reach out to those friends back home that say be compassionate, and say to them we can be compassionate. Let's get law and order back in our land and then let's show compassion. But law and order must come first. It is what this country was built on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to close, Mr. Speaker, by announcing that the American people have really spoken this week, stopped the Senate from forcing something through the Senate. And not only that, they have sent the message to their Members of the House of Representatives. And I would like to announce today that this week, because of all the reaction and the backlash against the Senate amnesty scheme, five new Members have joined the Immigration Reform Caucus in the House of Representatives.  And I am very happy to welcome new Members in that are committed and working hard to be able to finally do the right thing on illegal immigration and start enforcing our laws the way the American people want to do; securing our borders and securing our neighborhoods and securing our future for our grandchildren.</paragraph>
