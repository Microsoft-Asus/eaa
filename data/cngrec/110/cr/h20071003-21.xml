    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me talk about a surge in Iraq the President is not talking about. An outbreak of cholera is spreading across the country, harming and killing innocent Iraqi people. Five hundred new cases were confirmed in Kirkuk in the last 5 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The World Health Organization says there have only been 12 deaths so far, but there are 3,000 confirmed cases and 30,000 more Iraqis are sick. As a medical doctor, let me tell you that cholera is caused by human waste contaminating the water supply. In other words, the sewage treatment plants that we were supposed to rebuild that worked prewar are still not working after the surge. And innocent Iraqis are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a Seattle church group sent me to visit Iraq in 2002, they asked me to see firsthand how Iraqi children were suffering from the effects of the first war in 1990, the subsequent economic sanctions and how their suffering would only get worse in a new war. They were right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cholera is the latest example of a failed war. Instead of talking about the surge, the President should be talking about the scourge of cholera.</paragraph>
