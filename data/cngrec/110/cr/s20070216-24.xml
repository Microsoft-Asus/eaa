    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to recognize the 100th Anniversary of the Bright Star Restaurant in Bessemer, AL. Since 1907, the Bright Star has been providing the citizens of our State and its visitors with delicious food and superior service. Today, this family-owned business, led by Jimmy and Nick Koikos, continues to build on this tradition. While America is famous for its chain restaurants, there remain many of the old ones which have atmosphere, friendship,  and good food. They are a valuable part of our communities and unite us in many ways. The Bright Star is a classic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known for fresh gulf seafood, quality steaks, and fresh vegetables, the Bright Star is certain to satisfy every palate. The restaurant's Greek style specialties are my personal favorites. In fact, I don't believe the broiled snapper, along with the Greek salad, can be topped. Although, admittedly, the daily meat and three-vegetable specials certainly give them a run for their money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Famous faces, like legendary coach Paul "Bear" Bryant and former Senator Howell Heflin, frequented the Bright Star. I am certain that virtually all of our congressional delegation have eaten there including my colleague, Senator Shelby, on many occasions. It is the place for good friends, good food, and even a small taste of politics. Today, you will still see Alabama coaches and fans filing through the dining room on their way to and from seeing the Crimson Tide play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not so long ago, I brought John Ashcroft by for dinner. This was his first visit to Alabama after becoming the U.S. Attorney General, and I will never forget the wonderful reception Jimmy and the staff gave us. I wanted to show off the best of Birmingham, so dinner at this fine restaurant was a no-brainer. Jimmy gave us a mouth-watering overview of the menu, emphasizing as I had hoped that he would, the renown seafood dishes. Everything sounded delicious, however it turned out that the Attorney  General was allergic to seafood and shellfish. I seem to recall he had a steak that he enjoyed, but he certainly missed out on those fresh gulf delicacies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located just outside of Birmingham in the quaint downtown area of Bessemer, the Bright Star is easily accessible and certainly a destination attraction. Moreover, you can always expect a good crowd of folks dining there on any day of the week. Luckily, expansions to the building over the years, including ample banquet space, enable diners to be comfortably accommodated. I look forward to the lunch I have scheduled there for next week, and I highly recommend a visit to all.</paragraph>
