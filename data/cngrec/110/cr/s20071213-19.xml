  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier today, pursuant to section 307 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, I filed revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution. Those revisions were made for Senate amendment No. 3819, an amendment offered to Senate amendment No. 3500, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate did not adopt Senate amendment No. 3819. As a consequence, I am further revising the 2008 budget resolution and reversing the adjustments made pursuant to section 307 to the aggregates and the allocation provided to the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee for Senate amendment No. 3819.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> printed in the Record.</paragraph>
