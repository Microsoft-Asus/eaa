    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="343">H. Res. 343</bill>, as amended, which would support designation of August 11, 2007, as the sixth annual National Marina Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Marina Day recognizes the central role that marinas play in giving shelter and providing gateways to the nearly 13 million recreational boats registered in the United States. National Marina Day is also intended to recognize the important role that recreational boaters and marina operators play in protecting our Nation's critical marine resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recreational boating is a central part of the tourism and recreation industry in the United States. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, in 2005 recreational boating generated an estimated $37 billion in sales and services nationwide. In my own State of Maryland, there are just over 200,000 registered boats. A study by the Maryland Sea Grant program estimated that in 2005 every 7.5 boats in the State supported a job in our State's economy and contributed just over $7,600  in economic activity. Recreational boating contributed an estimated $1.8 billion to the State's gross product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The millions of Americans who participate in recreational boating activities rely on the estimated 12,000 marinas and associated boating facilities in our Nation to access not only the water, but also the support services that boats and boaters need. An estimated 30 percent of these marinas are owned by municipal or State governments and provide the public with water access at low or limited cost. The remaining 70 percent of marinas are private, and many are owner-operated facilities with long  family histories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, however, marinas are not only centers where boats can obtain fuel and services. They are also centers providing boating safety and boating education programs intended to help improve the operating proficiency of recreational boaters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Though 35 States now have some type of operator education or licensing  requirement, the National Transportation Safety Board reported in 2007 that more than 80 percent of all recreational boaters have still never taken any kind of boating educational program. Perhaps in large measure as a result of the still limited enrollment in recreational boating safety classes, total deaths in recreational boating exceed deaths in general aviation. Marinas will  continue to play a critical role in helping to reduce boating accidents and to lower the number of fatalities associated with recreational boating by organizing and hosting boating education programs to complement the technical services they provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that all marina operators through these United States will take the opportunity afforded this year by the National Marina Day to continue their vital effort to expand boating safety programs and efforts. I commend marina operators for their vital role in supporting recreational boating in the United States.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 343, which was introduced by my colleague Harold Rogers, recognizes August 11, 2007, as National Marina Day. This resolution acknowledges the significant contributions that marinas provide to so many of our local waterfront communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are over 12,000 marinas in the United States, and these facilities serve as a place where people who share a passion for the water can come together to enjoy our Nation's oceans, lakes and rivers. Marinas also serve as stewards of the environment and actively seek to protect the waterways that surround them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent a district in which recreational boating plays an important role in the lives of many constituents, and marinas provide an easy access point for citizens who wish to enjoy our Nation's waterways. This resolution highlights the importance of marinas and their role in promoting recreational boating and in connecting people to their local waterways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400340" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding me time, and I want to thank the gentlelady and the chairman for ushering this piece of legislation through the committee and on to the floor honoring and acknowledging the contributions of marina owners and operators across this great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it is fishing one of the 1,000 lakes in Minnesota, cruising the inland waterways of the Sunshine State, or enjoying the 1,200 miles of shoreline along Lake Cumberland in my district, marinas are America's launching point for millions of boats and boaters seeking to enjoy the beautiful rivers, lakes, bays and oceans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These marinas employ nearly 140,000 people at over 13,000 operations nationwide, providing safe harbor and supply depots for boaters. In Kentucky, over 130 marina facilities served over 176,000 registered boats in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, from Fishtrap Lake in the east to Lake Barkley out west. In between in my district is the crown jewel of Kentucky's waterways, Lake Cumberland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 5 million visitors a year jet ski, enjoy bass fishing and cruise the 40,000 acres of Lake Cumberland. Lake associated businesses, including the 11 large scale marina operations, generate over $160 million in economic activity for the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lake area is famously dubbed the "Houseboat Capital of the World," made famous by the prominence of world class houseboat manufacturing in Wayne, Pulaski and Russell Counties. These 100-foot houseboats are literally floating homes, with hot tubs, roof decks, full size kitchens, waterslides, grills, kitchens and the like. These boats are great venues for fishing trips, reunions or weekend escapes on the waterways across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution, Mr. Speaker, recognizes the essential role marinas and the men and women who own and operate them play in the United States, providing their communities and visitors a place where friends and families can come together for recreation, rest and relaxation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the committee for bringing this resolution through to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and designation of National Marina Day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller), the cochair of the Boating Caucus.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlelady yielding, and I certainly rise in strong support of House Resolution 343, which commemorates the marinas of the United States and expresses support for the sixth annual National Marina Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of National Marina Day is to inform the public about the important role that marinas do play in our local communities by providing a very safe, family-friendly venue to encourage the recreational boating industry, which can generate literally millions and billions of dollars in economic activity. The positive spin-off effects of marinas encourage the development of all kinds of businesses and restaurants to supplement the marinas' putting people to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Actually, in my home municipality of Harrison Township, Michigan, a huge part of our commercial tax base is marinas and recreational oriented businesses, and my congressional district is a shoreline waterfront district as well and our marinas play a very large role in the very identity of our region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Great Lakes region alone, boating and marinas generate $4.3 billion annually. Actually, I grew up in the marina business. It was our family business as well as our hobby. So I know firsthand that marinas also provide an essential venue for recreational boating, which is an important part in creating a very high quality of life in a community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While increasing access to our Nation's water resources, marinas also play an important role in keeping our Nation's water clean. Marinas provide an appropriate place to dispose of waste materials so that they are not discharged out into the waterways. Operators of marinas often play an important role in organizing cleanup efforts to collect marine debris to keep our waters clean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, marinas are playing a very important role as well in the defense of our Nation. I say that because they have been partnering with the United States Coast Guard, and the marina operators and their customers are staying vigilant and keeping their eyes open for suspicious activity. Just as our truck drivers are our eyes and ears on the interstate, marina operators and their customers are really our eyes and ears on the waterway as well. Marina operators fill a critical role  in keeping our Nation secure along our liquid borders, such as the one that my home State of Michigan shares with our great neighbors of Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would certainly urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again I want to thank Mr. Rogers of Kentucky for this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 343, commemorating the marinas of the United States and expressing support for the designation of National Marina Day on August 11, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are more than 12,000 marinas in the United States. They provide services and access for millions of recreational boaters to the lakes, rivers, and bays of the United States. In my State of Minnesota, marinas provide boaters access to thousands of lakes and the headwaters of the Mississippi River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each weekend, millions of Americans take to the water from marinas to enjoy fishing, kayaking, sailing, and just cruising down the river enjoying the water. Marinas make all of this happen. They employ more than 140,000 people whose sole purpose is to help boaters enjoy their time on the water safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 11, 2007, National Marina Day will focus on the role marinas play as safe, family-friendly gateways to boating, and the invaluable service marina operators and owners perform as stewards of the environment. Activities include fishing tournaments, boating  safety demonstrations, water sports, and environmental demonstrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also recognize that the role of the marina operator has changed since September 2001. They are helping the Coast Guard and others keep an eye out for suspicious activities on the waterways. Marina operators are on the water every day. They know what is routine--and what looks suspicious. They are keeping a lookout for aggressive behavior, unusual diving, suspicious packages on bridges or terminals, and other activities that appear out of place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure recognize the waterways of the United States as an important component of our national transportation system. However, these waterways also serve another important purpose: They allow people to have fun on the water. Marinas allow these types of recreational activities to occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gendeman from Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS) for introducing this resolution and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 343.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the National Marina Day. Kentucky's Marinas aye a substantial impact on the Commonwealth's economy. The First District of Kentucky is home to many of the United States' most adored lakes, which provide recreation areas for Kentuckians and important habitats for fish and wildlife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it would be too exhaustive to name every lake, two of the largest lakes are Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley. Together they create the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, LBL. LBL contains nearly 17,000 acres of habitats, trails, and campsites, providing tourists with a wide array of outdoor experiences. A canal connecting Lake Barkley with Kentucky Lake forms one of the greatest freshwater recreational complexes in the country. This site has been used for numerous fishing tournaments  and other outdoor events. These lakes are also home to many marinas that facilitate boating and fishing activities. Their presence helps ensure safe and reliable access to our lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the eastern side of my District is another exhilarating outdoor experience. Lake Cumberland is visited by more than 4.7 million people annually. According to the Travel Industry Association of America, the tourism economic impact for the four-county area, Clinton, Pulaski, Russell, Wayne, with access to the lake is $152.6 million. Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began a rehabilitation project at the Wolf Creek Dam on Lake Cumberland, which has impacted some of the marinas in the  area. However, the lake continues to be a great recreation and vacation spot, and we welcome visitors to come enjoy the opportunities available at the lake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marinas are instrumental to recreation and tourism and that is why I stand today in support of this industry. I ask that my colleagues do the same by voting in favor of <bill type="hr" number="343">H. Res. 343</bill> sponsored by U.S. Representative HAL ROGERS.</paragraph>
