    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, General Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and former Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army, urged the Armed Services Committee to "find the courage that our troops display so openly, to deserve their honorable and selfless sacrifice, and to not squander their sacrifices and the gains they have made."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Keane reviewed that the counteroffensive led by General David Petraeus is reducing sectarian violence. Sunnis are rejecting al Qaeda, and more Iraqis are working with our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osama bin Laden has described Iraq, quote, "The most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this third world war. It is raging in the land of the two rivers. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must have resolve to stop our enemies and support our brave troops who are fighting to defend our freedom and protect American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
