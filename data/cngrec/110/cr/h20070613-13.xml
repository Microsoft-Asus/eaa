    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the 109th Congress, Republicans enacted historic earmarking reforms that allowed Members to challenge and debate wasteful earmarks contained in spending bills on the House floor. This was a good step towards increased accountability and transparency in the earmarking process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last fall, Democrats campaigned on a pledge to make this the most ethical Congress in history. But, as they headed into their first appropriations season, we're confronted with the reality of their reforms. It seems that instead of increasing sunshine on how Congress is spending the American people's money, they prefer to create massive secret funds for earmarks that will be inserted into the bill after the votes have been taken on legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what is perhaps most egregious is the fact that they won't even let these earmarks, which are paid for with the American people's hard-earned tax dollars, be debated in the people's House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the most ethical Congress in history. This is a sham.</paragraph>
