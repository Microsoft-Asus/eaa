    <paragraph>The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley Reservation Water Rights Settlement Act sponsored by our colleague from Nevada, Congressman Dean Heller, would ratify and finalize the tribes' water rights settlement agreement with the State of Nevada and with the United States. This bill has faced many obstacles, but through bipartisan work, it is here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last few weeks of July, representatives from the Department of the Interior--the tribes and the staff--engaged in last-minute negotiations about the administration's concerns on waiver language. In the future, it is our hope that these concerns are addressed during committee consideration of legislation and not after the bill has been reported from the committee. We will work with the minority on addressing the need for more consistent waiver language in the next Congress. So I ask my  colleagues to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="5293">H.R. 5293</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This legislation authored by our colleague from Nevada (Mr. Heller) seeks to resolve the water claims associated with the Duck Valley Reservation in Nevada. This bill has undergone many changes. It reflects intense but good faith negotiations between the administration and staff on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic bill manager is correct in stating there is a need for consistency in waiver language, and while this bill's waiver language has been resolved for now, we have received commitments from the Democrats that  they will work together on applying consistent waiver language in all Indian water right settlements in the next Congress. I actually support this bill as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, one of the things that has changed over the past 30 years is we've had the same policies that have brought us to the situation in which we are today. It is the pain that people have faced at the gas pumps. It has been one of those things that has been a shocking realization. The road on which we have been traveling for over 30 years is a road that is simply not working. Sometimes there are people who, unfortunately, are happy with the pain that Americans  are going through at the pumps today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a former mayor of one of the major cities in Utah who did not like the fact that people were not living in his jurisdiction and were living across the county line. In an effort to punish them, he tried to insist that every effort to try and build more infrastructure and roads be hammered at every venue, at every opportunity. It looked at least from my side of that line as if it were punishment for actually deciding to live where you would want to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked once at length at a television and radio interview about the issue that we have with energy and about the problems that people are facing with the energy crisis that we have right now. One of the callers called in and said, you know, what we need to do is to simply have more commuter rail service. Now, I don't quibble with that caller, because he's right. We need to have more commuter rail. That's one of the solutions that we have, but having more commuter rail lines does not solve the  problem of the farmer who has to fill his tractor with diesel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For one of the farmers in my community, every time he fills up that tractor, it's $600 just to fill up one tractor. That is $600 for which he doesn't get reimbursed at the end of the week by putting in a voucher to his employer. It is $600 he has to eat until the end of the growing season when he may or may not receive money back for the sale of the goods that he produces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Commuter lines are great, but they don't help the trucker who still has to bring those products to market. Ninety-five percent of everything we consume comes to a store by way of truck, and commuter rail lines don't stop at grocery stores. Those truckers still have to be able to have the fuel necessary to bring the food to market. We sometimes forget there is a whole segue that is involved in this particular issue of our energy crisis and that everybody isn't part of it. It's in part of the agriculture  that we need. It's in part of the trucking industry that we need. It's in part of the pain that people feel at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those people who are looking at what is coming out of their pockets week after week don't want us simply coming back here and talking about a highfalutin energy policy. It's not an energy policy to them. It is the way they cook their food. It is the way they heat their homes. It's whether they have a job or not. The pain at the pump is what people are feeling right now, but come this winter, there's going to be pain as the prices of heating their homes will increase by 20 to 30 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far, the only solution this Congress seems to want to do to address that situation is to try to increase welfare payments or LIHEAP payments in some way rather than to go to the root cause of that problem, which is 30 years of mismanagement that we have had that brings us to this particular situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also means that food prices will be increasing because it is so much more difficult for the farmers to produce that food, for the processors to process that food, for the truck drivers to deliver that food. All of those are going to come as crisis after crisis after crisis if we do not address a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy policy and do it now. For every week that we delay, we delay and continue on with the pain that real people are facing out there in America, and we are turning  this country almost into a second class society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a principal once who was in the military before he went to education, and he always used to answer many of my requests with the old military phrase "rank has its privileges." It is true. Rank has privileges. That's why, in class, I was able to drink a Dr. Pepper and my students could not, because rank had privileges. That's why I get to park in the Cannon building parking garage and my staff does not. Rank has privileges. Some people are able to write bills in the secrecy of their offices  and to bring them directly to the floor because rank has privileges. Some people are able to establish an agenda here even though 136 Republicans came back here during the recess time and spoke on that floor, asking, begging, demanding that different</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Members met in Philadelphia to do their Constitution, a document we'll be celebrating in a couple of days, they were sent there to make minor adjustments to the Articles of Confederation, but they recognized that some of the States that had sent their instructions had also told them to go beyond that to solve the problem. What they decided was essential, not because it was what literally was put in front of them as their responsibilities, but what was essential to meet the needs of the  people was to solve the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we fail in this Congress to bring an all-of-the-above solution to the floor that is a real solution to real problems, we fail in our responsibility to Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, week after week, we have implored the Speaker of the House to address the most important issue of our day, and that is the energy crisis. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) outlined some of the severe problems that people are having and will continue to have until we address this and do what they expect us to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hear rumors and hints about the possibility of a bill coming to the floor and finally, perhaps, an announcement that we can have a vote on this energy crisis and its solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I first read in the newspaper that Speaker Pelosi had decided to open the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling, I thought it was too good to be true. Unfortunately, it turns out I was right. It really was too good to be true. While all of the headlines proclaimed that the House would finally get to vote on a real energy bill that expands domestic production, it simply wasn't true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats' latest energy plan lists the current moratorium on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf and replaces it with a provision that virtually guarantees that no drilling will ever take place there. Democrats are proposing to ban all drilling up to 50 miles off the coast, cutting off all access to some of the most promising areas. Then between 50 and 100 miles of the coast, the Democratic plan leaves it up to the States to decide whether to allow drilling. However, their plan cleverly  leaves out any incentives to the States to actually start drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the Democrats' bill, our all-of-the-above American Energy Act, which I'm proud to support, does not permanently lock up the most promising area for production. Instead, it allows the States to decide whether to allow drilling up to 50 miles off their coast, keeping those most promising areas available for consideration. It doesn't take an expert to see that by leaving out any sort of revenue sharing agreement my Democrat colleagues ensure that the States will have no real motivation to  take any action whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Energy Act, on the other hand, provides appropriate incentives for the States to make sure they see some of the benefits of drilling off their shores. Our bill includes revenue  sharing to provide the States with the financial motivation they need to act. States could use those royalties to benefit their citizens as they see fit. At the same time, all Americans would benefit from lower energy prices. This is a real energy bill. This is what  citizens expect and deserve from us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's time to stop playing games and wasting time. Let's have a straight up-or-down vote on the American Energy Act and give Americans the relief they deserve. They can't wait any longer and they shouldn't have to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just note that the energy crisis must be addressed in a deliberative fashion, not by a bumper sticker's reading "drill here; drill now" approach that would have us drilling in the National Mall. We will have all of the bills but one that includes accountability and a bill that transitions us to a better future--we must wean ourselves from this addiction to oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will have a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree with everything that Ms. Bordallo just said in her comments, that we should have an energy policy that comes in a deliberative fashion, which means that the bills should be allowed to have committee process. They should be allowed to have public hearings. They should be allowed to have an open rule so that Members can amend them in committee or here on the floor. That is the deliberative process. Those are the rules that these people try to establish.  That's the concept of the rules that these people try to establish so that we can go through this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everything she said is exactly accurate, except we're not going to do that. We're going to have a bill written in secret and unveiled on the floor. And if it, by chance, has an open rule, I'll be the very first one to be surprised and will probably apologize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But she is right. That is exactly, that is exactly what needs to take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I will certainly be watching for transparency and accountability in this bill. And let us hope that this is included when we are debating on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I again urge Members to support the bill at hand.</paragraph>
