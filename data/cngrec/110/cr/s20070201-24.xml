  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment I have filed to eliminate a provision that was added to the minimum wage bill regarding employee leasing firms, also known as professional employer organizations, or PEOs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have fought for a clean minimum wage bill, on the grounds that workers have been waiting 10 long years for this raise. During that time, businesses have seen record profits and productivity--and that has been equally the case in States and regions that have raised the minimum wage. Yet now we are being asked to include this aggressively anti-worker PEO provision in order to pass a minimum wage increase in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For my colleagues and others who may not know what a PEO is, let me explain. It is an organization that handles administrative details for workers who actually do work for another company. For example, I might technically be employed by Tristate PEO, but I actually show up to work every day at Main Street Construction Company. Companies use PEOs so they don't have to handle the tax-and-benefits paperwork for many of their workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language in the PEO provision, however, seeks to make these PEOs the "employer of record" for tax purposes. PEOs have sought to become the "employer of record" under various laws because they would like to be able to tell employers that the PEOs can independently take care of payroll taxes, workers' compensation, unemployment  insurance, and the like. However, in the past, PEOs have misrepresented what jobs are covered by workman's compensation--for  instance, by characterizing construction workers as clerical. Under current law, legal responsibility for employer obligations typically remains partly or wholly with the worksite employer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Making a PEO the sole employer makes the evasion of labor and employment standards much easier. The National Employment Law Project and other worker-rights advocates have concluded that the language now in the bill would make it harder for employees to go to an arbiter and get unpaid overtime, unemployment insurance benefits, or workman's compensation benefits if the PEO collapses. And this is by no means hypothetical. Such collapses have happened not just with small, fly-by-night operations,  but with large PEOs like Administaff and Simplified Employment Services, SES.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, when SES allowed health insurance premiums to go unpaid and then went bankrupt, it left employees like Melanie Martin out in the cold. She said "We trusted him to pay our insurance premiums, and now I'm stuck with a $7,000 surgery bill. Every time I think about this, I cry."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, when MidAtlantic Postal Express in Roanoke, VA, went bankrupt, the U.S. Treasury wasn't the only one left holding the bag. Employees were left wondering where to turn for thousands of dollars in back pay. Victory Compensation Services was the PEO handling the workers' pay and benefits, and admitted that workers had no workman's compensation coverage even though MidAtlantic had paid Victory premiums. But Victory blamed MidAtlantic for the unpaid payroll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let's say that you are newly unemployed trucker who is owed $7,000 in back pay. This is a complicated mess for a worker to try to navigate just to get a paycheck that he or she is owed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is part of a larger, systemic problem. Working people in the United States feel less and less empowered in our you're-on-your-own society. Seventy percent of families are headed by either dual-income couples or a single parent. The housing bubble is bursting. Globalization is sending American jobs overseas. Pensions are being frozen at an unprecedented pace. The national savings rate has actually gone into negative figures. Women are working an average of 500 more hours more per year than  in 1979. But productivity has increased 70 percent since then. People are working harder and getting paid less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this context of economic anxiety, we shouldn't be making it even harder for workers to organize, negotiate or enforce contracts, or fight for their rights under law. But that will be the sure-fire result if the final bill has this PEO provision in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to strip this provision from the bill. We must not sacrifice worker rights in exchange for this modest and long-overdue increase in the wages for those at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have long supported an increase in the minimum wage. I am pleased that, with the leadership of the new majority in Congress, this minimum wage increase will be passed by a bipartisan majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996 Congress raised the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour in two steps to $5.15 an hour. That increase was enacted more than 10 years ago. Since then, the real value of that wage has eroded by 21 percent and the nearly 5.5 million workers earning the minimum wage have already lost all of the gains from the 1996-1997 increase. Since then, Gallup polls have shown that 86 percent of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business, and nearly half of small business  owners think that the minimum wage should be increased. Since then, 29 States, including Michigan, as well as the District of Columbia have recognized the importance of keeping our working families out of poverty by increasing State minimum wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, since the 1970s, poverty has increased by 50 percent among full-time, year-round workers. Currently, 37 million Americans, including 13 million children, live in poverty. As the most prosperous nation in the world, our minimum wage should be a living wage, and it is not. When a father or mother works full time, 40 hours a week, year-round, they should be able to lift their family out of poverty. A full-time minimum wage laborer working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks earns $10,700  per year--more than $6,000 below the Federal poverty guidelines for a family of three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that a full-time minimum wage job should provide a minimum standard of living in addition to giving workers the dignity that comes with a paycheck. These lower paid workers, many of whom have entered the workforce due to the welfare reform, should be rewarded for entering the workforce, not penalized by a poverty wage. A higher minimum wage has the potential to ensure that lower paid workers will be protected from falling into poverty and possibly back on the welfare rolls. The minimum  wage increase during the recession in 1991 provided much needed income to poor people and helped to increase spending in the economy. 58 percent of the benefit of the 1996 increase went to families in the bottom 40 percent of income groups. Over one-third of the benefit went to the poorest families--those in the bottom 20 percent of income groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the real value of the minimum wage is $4.00 below what it was in 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be at least $9.37 an hour today, not $5.15. According to the United States Department of Labor, over 60 percent of minimum wage earners are women; almost 40 percent are minorities, and nearly 80 percent are adults. These hardworking Americans deserve a fair deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the long overdue minimum wage provision, this bill contains a package of tax provisions. I am pleased that these include a number of measures to crack down on abusive tax dodges, including an improvement to current law to end the tax benefits received by companies that reincorporate and set up shell headquarters in offshore tax havens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that the bill extends the work opportunity tax credit, which allows employers credit against wages for hiring workers from targeted groups such as recipients of public assistance, qualified veterans, and "high risk" youth. I have heard from a number of Michigan companies that the WOTC program is important to them in their hiring members of these targeted groups, and I am pleased that this provision will be extended through the end of 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that the tax provisions would put in place a limit on the amount that corporate executives and other highly paid employees can place tax-free into deferred compensation plans. Under current law, public companies cannot deduct more than $1 million per year for compensation paid to their top officers. However, compensation that is "deferred," meaning the employee doesn't have immediate access to it, is not subject to this $1 million limit; so deferred compensation packages have  become a main way that company executives can get multi-million dollar compensation packages while their companies continue to take a tax write-off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen these excessive packages time and again in recent stories about runaway executive compensation totaling tens of millions of dollars. Tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars have been salted away in this fashion for corporate executives, and companies have simply found another way to game the system by excluding this "deferred compensation" from those individuals' income for the year. It is more than time for Congress to put an end to this game which has fueled excessive executive  pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would set a limit on the amount of compensation that could receive tax deferral at the lower of $1 million annually or the average of the previous 5 years compensation. The ability of corporate executives to defer tax on up to $1 million in compensation is still a significant benefit that stands in stark contrast to the minimum wage we are attempting to raise for those at the lowest end of the pay scale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only right that those who are at the low end of the pay scale who work hard should receive a fair wage and be able to support their families. These people do not always have the leverage to negotiate a fair salary. This bill to increase the minimum wage will help to move them to a more livable wage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I will unavoidably miss the final vote on  the minimum wage bill but I come down here now to ask unanimous consent that the RECORD reflect, immediately after the vote, my announcement that I would have voted against this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In so doing, I remain consistent on the issue. Government is best when it is does not pick winners and losers--when it does not competitively advantage one group of people over another or one set of States over another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator DEMINT offered an amendment to equally and fairly increase the minimum wage by $2.10 for each State over what the wage is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that the liberals voted against the DeMint amendment is proof that their bill as now constituted is really about damaging the competitiveness of middle America--the so-called red States, disparagingly called `'fly-over country" by liberals--compared to the liberal fringe States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this amendment, the underlying legislation would partially exempt minimum wage workers in higher-cost States that already have State minimum wage rates greater than the Federal level of $5.15 an hour, and completely exempt minimum wage workers in highest-cost States that have State minimum wage rates near $7.25 an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DeMint amendment would increase the Federal minimum wage equally for workers in all States at the same rate as <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill> would increase the minimum wage from the current Federal minimum wage rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator KENNEDY's arguments against this amendment have been both confusing and contradictory. On the one hand, he said that we need a one-size-fits-all mandate, and then he said that Massachusetts has a higher cost of living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not stand for people in Washington, DC, damaging the competitiveness of Oklahoma against other States. If Oklahomans vote to change our own laws, that is one thing, but we are not going to buckle under to DC and the liberal fringe States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus I would vote nay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following chart be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I speak today in support of passage of <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The Federal minimum wage has not been increased in almost 10 years and an increase is long overdue. I have been a strong supporter of an increase in the Federal minimum wage for many years and I am delighted the Senate is finally about to vote for an increase in the Federal minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This much-needed increase is projected to benefit close to 13 million Americans either with a direct increase in their minimum wage or indirectly by promoting higher wages for other working Americans earning more than the minimum wage. This increase is sorely needed because the current minimum wage cannot adequately support workers as its value has eroded significantly since the last increase in 1997. Furthermore, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that after adjusting for inflation,  the value of the minimum wage is at its lowest level since 1955. As the costs of housing, health care, energy, and education continue to skyrocket, we must raise the minimum wage to provide millions of hard-working Americans the respect and dignity their work demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More and more of these working Americans find themselves mired in poverty or living on the cusp of poverty. Right now, there are 37 million Americans living in poverty, including 13 million children. Since the 1970s, poverty has increased by 50 percent for full-time, year-round workers. Minimum wage workers who work full time earn $10,700 a year, which is almost $6,000 below the Federal poverty guidelines for a family of three. No American should work full-time, year- round,  and still live in poverty. While this modest increase in the Federal minimum wage will not eliminate poverty, it will provide hard-working Americans with a well-deserved increase in their wages. This increase will provide more money for workers to purchase prescription drugs, to pay utilities and rent,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with this increase in the Federal minimum wage, workers in Wisconsin and throughout the country will still struggle to afford housing. The National Low Income Housing Coalition estimates that the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Wisconsin is $666 a month and calculates that a worker in Wisconsin needs to make $12.80 an hour to avoid paying more than 30 percent of his or her income on housing. According to NLIHC data, a full-time minimum wage employee earning the current $5.15  an hour needs to work 79 hours a week, 52 weeks a year to afford a two-bedroom apartment. Madam President, 79 hours a week is almost the equivalent of two full-time minimum wage workers and the number of hours of work required to cover the costs of an apartment are even higher in States with higher housing costs. It is a disgrace that in many cases, minimum wage</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately hunger and food insecurity are also a reality for far too many minimum wage workers. Even in a State known for its diverse agricultural production, many Wisconsinites periodically face hunger. Food Stamps, or FoodShare as it is known in Wisconsin, serves over 25 million nationwide and 329,000 Wisconsinites. Even with this and other Federal nutrition assistance programs combined with the dedicated work of food pantries, soup kitchens and even many religious organizations, 9 percent--or  1 out of 11 of households in Wisconsin lack sufficient food. Many of these food assistance recipients are working at low-wage jobs, so increasing the minimum age is an important step. But even with this improvement, it will not fully solve this problem and I will continue to work to provide improved Federal support in the Farm Bill and elsewhere to reduce hunger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Housing costs are not the only necessity of life that minimum wage workers have to provide for themselves and their families. They also have to purchase groceries, provide health care, pay for higher education, pay for increasingly expensive gas and electric costs, and provide child care for their children. Some Americans may think that the majority of minimum wage workers are teenagers in the first job; that perception is incorrect. The Economic Policy Institute notes that over 70 percent of  minimum wage workers are adults and in Wisconsin, over 80 percent of minimum wage workers are adults. Moreover, of these adult minimum wage workers, over 30 percent are the sole breadwinners of their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is unconscionable that in the almost 10 years that we have not raised the minimum wage, Congress has voted to increase its own pay by $31,600. People in Wisconsin find it hard to understand why Members of Congress received substantial pay raises at a time when the real value of the minimum wage has eroded by 20 percent since 1997. As my colleagues know, I have long fought against automatic congressional pay increases and will continue to do so. I have introduced legislation that would  put an end to automatic cost-of-living</paragraph>
    <paragraph>adjustments for congressional pay. Mr. President, we have Americans who are working full time, 52 weeks a year and they cannot afford health care, housing, and child care. They don't have the power to automatically raise their pay--they are dependent on Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage. But instead of working to raise the minimum wage during the past 10 years, we in Congress worked to protect our automatic pay raises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of increasing the minimum wage argue that it hurts the economy and job growth, but past increases in the minimum wage do not support that argument. In the 4 years after the previous minimum wage increase, nearly 12 million new jobs were created. A 1998 Economic Policy Institute study did not find significant job loss associated with the 1997 minimum wage increase. Additionally, the Center on Wisconsin Strategy examined job growth after the June 2005 increase in Wisconsin's minimum wage  and found that Wisconsin had an average growth of 30,000 more jobs, not a job loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This increase is a great start, but more needs to be done for the American worker. I am pleased an amendment I offered was accepted into the underlying package that seeks to support American manufacturers. I thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy, for his leadership in moving this bill through the Senate and both he and his staff for their assistance in getting my Buy American reporting requirement amendment accepted into the Senate package. This amendment is based on past Buy American  reporting requirements that I have been successful in getting enacted in various appropriations bills from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Buy American reporting requirement requires Federal agencies to submit annual reports that include the following information: (a) the dollar value of any articles, materials, or supplies purchased that were manufactured outside of the United States; (b) an itemized list of all waivers of the Buy American Act granted with respect to such articles, materials, or supplies, and a citation to the treaty, international agreement, or other law under which each waiver was granted; (c) if any articles,  materials, or supplies were acquired from entities that manufacture articles, materials, or supplies outside the United States, the specific exemption under the Buy American Act that was used to purchase such articles, materials, or supplies; and (d) a summary of total procurement funds spent on goods manufactured in the United States versus funds spent on goods manufactured outside of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also requires that these reports should be made publicly available to the maximum extent possible and contains a common sense exception for members of the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long believed that an important way Congress can support American manufacturers and workers is to ensure that the Federal Government buys American-made goods whenever reasonably possible. Congress enacted such a policy when it passed the Buy American Act of 1933. That act requires government agencies to purchase American-made goods but allows these requirements to be waived in certain specified cases. I am concerned that those waivers may be being used excessively. Unfortunately, right  now, only the Department of Defense is required to permanently report on its use of waivers of domestic procurement laws. I hope that this Buy American reporting language can help ensure that the entire government buys American-made goods in every possible circumstance, and is able to explain its reasons when it does not do so. This is a straightforward way to help ensure that the Federal Government--and American taxpayer dollars--support American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State has suffered a huge loss of manufacturing jobs over the past 6 fyears. According to statistics from the Department of Labor, Wisconsin lost over 90,000 manufacturing jobs between January 2000 and November 2006. Unfortunately, many other manufacturing states around the country are facing similarly tough times. The Economic Policy Institute reported that the August 2006 level of manufacturing employment is "at near lows not seen since the 1950s." The continued loss of high-paying manufacturing  jobs underscores the need for the Federal Government to support American workers and businesses by buying American-made goods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American workers need our support on a range of issues, whether it is by  increasing the minimum wage, fighting against bad trade policies, or encouraging the purchase of American-made goods. The Senate took a good first step with the passage of this legislation. I was proud to vote for the 1996-1997 increase bringing the minimum wage to its current level of $5.15 an hour and I am pleased to now support the increase in the Federal minimum wage from $5.15  to $7.25.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the minimum wage was established in 1938, its purpose was to ensure that American workers were fairly compensated for a day's work. Despite the passage of this increase, far more work needs to be done to support hard-working American families. I look forward to working with my colleagues in this new Congress to promote housing, education, and health care policies that support the working men and women of this country. This is a great victory for families in Wisconsin and throughout the Nation  and it is my hope that this first step paves the way for additional legislative victories for working Americans this year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today in support of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been 10 years since Congress last voted to raise the minimum wage. In the meantime, our cost of living has increased annually and working families have struggled to meet their most basic needs. The current Federal minimum wage just isn't sufficient. Now is the time to raise the minimum wage. It is time to give America's hard-working, low-wage workers a raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will increase the Federal minimum wage by $2.10 an hour to $7.25 an hour. This increase will be done in three phases over a 26 month period. The minimum wage has proven to be an important tool in fighting poverty in our country and I believe that this modest increase will help to improve the situation of low-wage workers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fair Minimum Wage Act also contains several key tax credits. These tax credits will encourage small businesses to continue to explore new investments and make improvements to their business property. This bill will extend the tax credit provided to employers who hire workers who have experienced barriers to entering the workforce, such as low-income workers welfare and food stamp recipients, and high-risk youth. The work opportunity tax credit will also apply to the hiring of veterans disabled  after the September 11, 2001, attacks. I believe that these tax credits will be of benefit to our small businesses owners and I hope that my colleagues will support this package.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to support the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 to increase the Federal minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 will increase the Federal minimum wage by $2.10 to $7.25. Oregon's minimum wage, which is $7.80 and adjusted annually for inflation, will not be impacted by this boost. Nevertheless, I support the increase of the Federal minimum wage for our Nation's employees. I also support the inclusion of the small business tax relief in the legislation. I believe this is a valuable legislative package, helping both our Nation's employees and small businesses and strengthening  America's workforce and economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today will have a positive impact on our low-income workers. An estimated 14 million workers will receive a pay increase if the minimum wage were raised from $5.15 to $7.25. There are roughly 3.9 million families with children under 18 that will benefit from this minimum wage increase, including 1.4 million single parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that we had this debate on the Senate floor. By engaging in this bipartisan discussion, we were able to reach a compromise that benefits low-income American workers. After 10 years, hard-working Americans, many of whom are working full-time jobs, will be in a better position to pay their bills, take care of their families, and reinvest in the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also support the tax relief included in this bill for our Nation's small businesses. As a small business owner, I know first hand what it takes to meet a payroll and to sign the front of a paycheck. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, employing more than half of all private sector employees and generating 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually. Targeted tax and regulatory relief is vital to helping these businesses continue to create new jobs, stay competitive, and  keep our economy growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the Senate leadership for bringing forth the minimum wage bill to help our Nation's workers. I am honored to support the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to speak briefly on a revenue provision contained in the minimum wage bill. Senator Baucus and I worked closely on the tax bill, both on the provisions providing relief to small businesses affected by the minimum wage but also the offsets that made sure the package was in balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the offsets, that dealing with limiting the amounts of annual deferrals under nonqualified deferred compensation plans, has attracted some concern and raised some questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought it would be useful to my colleagues for me to provide a brief sketch of where we have been on this issue. The issue of nonqualified deferred compensation came to the attention of the Finance Committee in response to the Joint Committee on Taxation's investigation into Enron--done at the request of the Finance Committee. The Enron report highlighted a number of abuses by top executives involving nonqualified deferred compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the American Jobs Creation Act that Congress passed in 2004, there were included provisions that limited deferred nonqualified compensation plans. In brief, the legislation limited when and under what circumstances distributions could be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, in the Pension bill passed last year, Congress restricted funding of nonqualified deferred compensation plans if the employer had underfunded certain other retirement plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Finance Committee last September had a hearing that looked closely at executive compensation that covered a wide range of pay issues involving top employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues can see, the issue of executive compensation and particularly nonqualified deferred compensation has been of long-standing interest for the Finance Committee. I expect that these matters will continue to command the attention of the committee this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of concerns that have been raised about this most recent provision contained in the minimum wage bill is its possible impact on middle management. I appreciate those calling for caution. The Finance Committee's Republican staff is reviewing the legislation and seeking to get more and better numbers about who is affected by this legislation. In addition, there have been bipartisan discussions at the staff level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In discussions with Joint Committee on Taxation I have asked them what would be the impact of eliminating the 5-year average compensation limitation so that the aggregate amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan would be limited to $1 million annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JCT informs me that this would reduce the current $806 million score by less than $100 million--so it would only be a small shave off the score. This suggests to me, that the vast majority of individuals--90 percent--who would be affected by this reform are among the wealthiest--i.e., those individuals receiving more than $1 million annually in nonqualified deferrals. I hope this information will help inform members as we discuss this matter in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I think it is important for members to bear in mind that ERISA does not apply to so-called "top hat" plans, these top hat plans being those for top management. There is a concern that if a nonqualified plan is widely applicable, as widely applicable as some of the opponents of this provision contend, it raises other red flags.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue raised is the fact that a widely applicable plan should be treated as an ERISA plan. If these widely applicable nonqualified deferred compensation plans are actually ERISA plans, they then should come under the protections that Congress has put in place under ERISA to provide workers retirement security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue to look at this provision and bear in mind the issues raised by my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, we are finishing up debate on the Senate minimum wage/small business tax relief bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate invoked cloture on the Baucus substitute amendment. It contained two basic components. The first one is the proposed increase in the Federal minimum wage. The second component is tax incentives to assist workers and businesses burdened by the increased Federal minimum wage. That part of the package was approved, on a bipartisan basis, by the Finance Committee late last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, by approving the Baucus substitute on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, the Senate has made its will clear: a minimum wage increase must be linked to small business tax relief package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the normal course of events, after Senate passage, the amended House bill would either go into conference or go back to the House as amended. We call the latter procedure "pingpong."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since tax matters were linked and the House bill doesn't have tax provisions, the House Democratic leadership and tax writers have threatened to send the Senate bill back to the Senate. They will claim that they are protecting prerogatives of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We find ourselves stuck on minimum wage because the House Democrats have threatened to use the "blue slip" procedure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, no one should be mistaken. It is House Democrats, not Senate Republicans, who are delaying passage of the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If House Democrats send us a suitable revenue bill, Senate Republicans will be ready to move expeditiously to the next step. Right now, we can not move.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if the House Democrats send us a minimum wage-related revenue bill, what happens next?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is up to our Democratic and Republican leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two basic avenues to take. One is a conference. The other is to amend the House revenue bill back with the Senate-passed bill and send it to the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On tax bills, we have used both approaches over the last few years. For instance, the Hurricane Katrina tax relief measures never went to conference. On the other hand, we had conferences on the tax relief reconciliation bill and the pension bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still another approach would be for the House to combine its minimum wage bill with the Senate tax relief package and send it over here. That route, though unusual, has also worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, I have indicated to my Republican leadership that I am wary about the conference option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Democratic leadership only came to linking minimum wage with small business tax relief after Chairman Baucus relayed the Republican position to them. It took a cloture vote to prove Chairman Baucus right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, if we go to conference, the Senate Democratic leadership and House Democratic leadership might be perfectly willing to scrap the Senate's position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Apparently, at a pen and pad session with reporters today, the majority leader indicated as much. He told reporters he wanted a "clean" minimum wage bill to come out of conference. Now, I am told the majority leader's press operation has attempted to change the impression those remarks left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's just say I am reasonably suspicious of those kinds of "clarifications." Apparently, the majority leader also said he would be prepared to dare Republicans to filibuster a clean minimum wage conference report. By "clean," he appears to be referring to the term used by House and Senate Democratic leadership to mean no linked small business tax relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake--the easiest and quickest way to send a minimum wage bill to the President would be for the House to send the Senate a bill identical to the Senate-passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An alternative quick option would be for the House to send us a revenue bill and the Senate would amend the bill and send it to the House. The House could then send the bill to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference option could be troublesome. It could be drawn out. Or, it could be a way for the House and Senate Democratic leadership to subvert the Senate position. That would not be a good way to start out the new session. In a conference setting, it would mean the Senate Democratic leadership acting in a manner that is at odds with how it said it was going to conduct business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I counsel my leadership and the Democratic leadership to consider my concerns about the next step.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am grateful to the people of Montana for sending me to Washington as their Senator. I never forget whom I am here to represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why my staff and I continually meet and talk with small business owners and CPAs from across the State. In anticipation of legislation to increase the minimum wage, I wanted to know how Montana's small businesses would be affected, I wanted to know what tax benefits would help small businesses, and I wanted to make sure that the Senate substitute to <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill> would benefit Montanans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I thank James McHugh of Hammer Jack's in Missoula; Robert Walter of Walter's IGA and ACE in Sheridan; James Whaley of Whaley &amp; Associates in Missoula; Ken Walsh of Ruby Valley National Bank in Twin Bridges; Micki Frederikson of Bingham, Campbell, Amrine, and Nolan in Missoula; Dan Vuckovich of Hamilton Misfeldt &amp; Company in Great Falls; Ronald Yates, Jr. of Eide Bailly in Billings; David Johnson of Anderson Zurmuehlen &amp; Co. in Helena; and Leslee Tschida of M.A.R.S. Stout in Missoula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the men and women of Montana for their hard work, for their input into the formulation of this legislation, for their dedication to grow their companies, and for their confidence in me to deliver for Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, today the Senate will increase the minimum wage and provide tax relief to the Nation's small businesses. This important legislation will help millions of working Americans and those who employ them. It has been a decade since the last minimum wage increase. It is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased we added a package of tax incentives for small businesses because many worry that a minimum wage increase will place a burden on small businesses. I want to take a moment to thank the individuals who worked so hard on the tax package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to thank my good friend Senator GRASSLEY, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for his leadership on this bill. I also appreciate the hard work and cooperation of his staff, especially Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, Dean Zerbe, Elizabeth Paris, Chris Javens, Cathy Barre, Anne Freeman, Grant Menke, Stanford Swinton and Nick Wyatt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and Senate Legislative Counsel for their service. I also want to recognize two staff members of the Joint Committee on Taxation who are leaving Congress, Patricia McDermott and Gray Fontenot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patricia McDermott will be retiring from her position as legislation counsel with the Joint Committee of Taxation and moving to the private sector. Tricia was qualified plans branch chief in the Office of Associate Chief Counsel at IRS before she came to Joint Tax as a detailee in July of 2000. She joined the JCT staff when the detail ended in 2001. Tricia has advised us on many projects, but I especially want to thank her for the expertise and tireless effort she brought to our work on the Pension  Protection Act of 2006. Tricia's knowledge--and her patience--were invaluable and will not be easily replaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we bid farewell to Gray Fontenot, an accountant with the Joint Tax Committee, who will be leaving this week to head to the private sector. Gray has been an essential adviser, particularly on the Katrina tax relief bills. As a native of New Orleans, whose extended family was personally affected by the hurricane, he truly understood the needs of the Gulf Zone, and his expertise was greatly appreciated by the members and staff of the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I thank my staff for their tireless effort and dedication, including Russ Sullivan, Bill Dauster, Pat Heck, Rebecca Baxter, Melissa Mueller, Judy Miller, Pat Bousliman, Ryan Abraham, Carol Guthrie, and Erin Shields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank our dedicated fellows, Mary Baker, Thomas Louthan, and Sara Shepherd, and our talented interns, David Ashner, Larry Boyd, Sarah Butler, Gretchen Hector, Molly Keenan, and Ryan Majerus.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, as I have said during the course of the last 9 days, on this side of the aisle we are prepared to go ahead and vote. We have been prepared to vote since the first day we were on this legislation. It only took 4 hours for the House of Representatives to debate this issue and then to proceed to a vote. We have been on this for 9 days. We have debated an increase to the minimum wage 16 other days since the last increase. Twenty-five days of debate about the increase  in the minimum wage. Imagine that, 25 days taking up the time of the United States Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all the challenges we face in education, in energy, in health, and jobs, all the challenges we are facing in terms of environmental issues and foreign policy issues, we have spent 25 days on whether we are going to increase the minimum wage. Twenty-five days during this period of time. On this side, we are prepared to move ahead. We are prepared to move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President of the United States made this talk yesterday on Wall Street, and it was well received and cheered on Wall Street, as he talked about how well the economy has been proceeding. Well, I took a few moments earlier in the day to talk about the increase in the number of families who are living in poverty. We have close to 2 million more children living in poverty today than we had 5 years ago. Two million more families living in poverty than we had 5 years ago. That is according to the  census. That is not some speech writer's concept, those are hard facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President John Adams, one of our great Founders, said facts are stubborn things. Those numbers are stubborn things. Facts speak. Increased numbers of Americans have gone into poverty over the last 5 years, with an increase in the number of children who have gone into poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other countries have addressed the problems of poverty and have lifted children out of poverty, lifted families out of poverty, and most of them have used an increase in the minimum wage to do it. You have to understand the problem in order to address it, and this President, evidently, doesn't understand the kinds of pressures that are on working families and middle-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of some of our great churches in this country have strongly supported the increase in the minimum wage. We have over 1,000 different organizations that have supported the increase in the minimum wage. I have included most of their letters of support in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is one from the Urban League:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing this wage hike represents a small but necessary step to help lift America's working poor out of the ditches of poverty and onto the road toward economic prosperity and will narrow the financial gap between Americans of color and whites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the National Urban League president, President Morial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we have an extraordinary group of business owners and executives for a higher minimum wage. They are some of the large companies in the country and some of the small companies. It is six pages long in terms of the companies themselves, ranging from Mr. Alex Von Bidder, president of the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York, a very high-cost restaurant, to some of the small mom-and-pop stores, but all of them expressing the view that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We expect an increased minimum wage to provide a boost to local economies. Businesses and communities will benefit as low-wage workers spend their much-needed pay raises at businesses in the neighborhoods where they live and work. Higher wages benefit business by increasing consumer purchasing power, reducing costly employee turnover, raising productivity, improving product quality, customer satisfaction, and company reputation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a recent National Consumers' League survey, 76 percent of American consumers said how well a company treats and pays its employees influences what they buy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have a letter from the president of Catholic Charities, Father Larry Snyder, and included in his letter are these words:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several years, our agencies have been coping with steady increases of 20 percent each year in requests for emergency assistance because low-wage workers simply cannot earn enough to cover rent, child care, food, utilities, and clothing for their families. Many people served by Catholic Charities agencies are poor despite full-time employment at the bottom of the labor market: cleaning houses and office buildings, harvesting and preparing food, watching over children of working parents.  They contribute to our Nation's economic prosperity. Yet the current minimum wage leaves them nearly $6,000 below the poverty line. People who work full time should not live in poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then he continues:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Catholic tradition teaches that society, acting through government, has a special obligation to consider first the needs of the poor. Catholic social teaching tells us that a just wage is not just an economic issue--it is a moral issue. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated in its pastoral letter, Economic Justice for All, "all economic institutions must support the bonds of community and solidarity that are essential to the dignity of persons."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dignity of persons, that is what the increase in the minimum wage is about. It will help those 6 million children get a chance to maybe buy a book and read a little more, maybe even participate in a birthday party, maybe have a chance to spend a little more time with their parent because their parent will not have to have two or three jobs. Here they are talking about the importance of dignity, "essential to the dignity of persons." That is what this debate is about, the dignity of persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the list goes on. Virtually all of the churches of faith have all recognized the importance of this issue, and interestingly, they have all pointed out what this letter says from Catholic Charities; that over the past several years their agencies have been coping with steady increases of 20 percent each year in requests for emergency assistance because low-income workers simply cannot afford the necessities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is true about my food bank in Boston. I was there just a few weeks ago talking to those who run it. It is an extraordinary institution. They have the same kinds of demands. We hear it all over the country. Yet we have the President talking on Wall Street about everything is fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what are some of the facts? We are finding out what is happening. First of all, the Bush economy fails American families' wallets. This is the median household income: $47,599 in 2000 and $46,326 in 2005. These numbers are from the Bureau of the Census. Imagine people opening up their newspapers and seeing the pictures of the President being cheered on Wall Street talking about how well the economy is going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one is doubting that the economy is working well for Wall Street. We are not talking about that. If you are asking the Census Bureau, not a speech writer but the Census Bureau, these are their figures, and this is what has been happening to the median household income. It has declined $1,273. That is from the Bureau of the Census. That is what has happened to the median household income across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have those members of our various faiths talking about the increase in demand, the 20-percent increase in demand. Yet we are seeing these kinds of figures. We see this kind of drop in real income. Yet let's look at the cost of the things these individuals have to buy. We have the decline in the family income, but look at what has happened. Gas has gone up 36 percent; health insurance, 33 percent, which is a very modest estimate; nationwide college tuition, 35 percent; housing, 38 percent.  And I would say, for the most part, these are rather modest. They come from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the College Board's Annual Survey of Colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, certainly in New England, those numbers are a great deal higher. But, nonetheless, it makes the point that real income has gone down and the cost of everything that a family has to buy, in terms of gasoline, health insurance for their family, college tuition, and housing has gone up. Look at the end of this chart. Wages stagnant across the way; up 1 percent. These are the figures. We haven't put the food in there, but these are strong indicators, and certainly food has gone up,  although perhaps not as high as these indicators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at the other side and see what has been happening down there on Wall Street. My goodness, look at  this chart. Look what has happened to corporate profits during this same time. While real family income has been going down, these corporate profits have grown by 80 percent, 80 percent they have gone up. Eighty percent. Real income for the family has gone down over the last 5 years, but corporate profits have gone up 80 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No wonder the President was cheered on Wall Street. No wonder. And look on the bottom line. That is the minimum wage. It slows, the extraordinary explosion in corporate profits. Yet the minimum wage has not gone up because our Republican friends refuse to let it go up. This is not any mystery. The Democrats are ready to vote. We are ready to vote this afternoon. We were ready to vote when it first came up, or at any time, but we can't get an agreement to vote. We are going to have to get it because  the time is going to run out sometime tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these are the corporate profits that have gone up. Here is the minimum wage worker that has to work more than a day just to fill up his tank with gasoline. These are the kinds of things that they are faced with. And as we have pointed out earlier, more than a thousand Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith leaders say that minimum wage workers deserve a prompt, clean, minimum wage increase, with no strings attached. This is Let Justice Roll, January of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have given the statistics, the flow lines, the charts, and so, Madam President, let me wind up this part of my presentation by mentioning what it means in real people's terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An increase in the minimum wage helps Constance Martin of Pittsburgh, PA. Constance used to have a good job that paid a decent wage. Then her son got cancer. She was forced to choose between that job and taking care of her child. So now she works for $5.50 an hour at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Her job has no health care or other health benefits. She can barely afford to pay the rent and utilities, much less to give her son the care he needs. When Pennsylvania raised its minimum wage at the State  level last year, it was a help but still not enough to keep pace with the cost of living. A Federal raise would allow her to pay off her bills and provide for her son's future instead of living day to day and hand to mouth just to get by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A raise in the minimum wage would help Tonya Schmidt. Tonya is a single mother with two children, ages 8 and 11. She works at Little Caesar's pizza. It is hard work, but she likes her job and is good at it. Tonya talked about how hard it is for her to get by each month. Her family lives in a converted motel room, but she has trouble making rent. She doesn't have a car but relies on friends and family to take her to the grocery store to buy food for her children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonya can't afford the basic necessities for her children. She often cannot afford to buy her children the clothes they need to go to school. Tonya says a higher minimum wage would help her provide her kids with these basic necessities, and it might help her get a few steps ahead to buy a used car or pay for car insurance so that she could go to the grocery store on her own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A raise in the minimum wage would help Gina Walter from Ohio. Gina, a 44-year-old single mother, works in a retail job at a thrift store. Gina earns $6.25 an hour, just over $12,000 per year. She has no car or health insurance and hasn't taken a vacation in 6 years. It takes Gina 2 full days of work just to pay her gas bill every month. She cuts her own hair because she can't afford to get a haircut. But Gina goes to work every day. She works hard and tries to build a better life for her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the typical statement: working hard, trying to provide for their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help Gina provide better opportunities for her 18-year-old daughter. It will help pay her gas bill and be able to go get a haircut. It might even help her finally take that vacation she so richly deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, this is what we are talking about on the floor of the Senate. I will speak later about what I really think about this increase in the minimum wage in terms of it being the defining aspect of our country's humanity and a reflection of our sense of decency and our sense of fairness. But it is a scandal that we have not increased our minimum wage over a 10-year period. Hopefully we will have an opportunity to do it before the day is out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of final passage of <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, as amended. I think it is a very exciting time. I appreciate the wise direction this body has decided upon with regard to the minimum wage. Yesterday, 88 Members of the Senate correctly concluded that raising the minimum wage, without providing relief for small business that must pay for that increase, is simply not an option. Rather the option we did strongly decide on included tax benefits to help offset  the impact on small business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to reiterate my hope that our colleagues in the House will not derail this bipartisan approach to offering real support and relief to the middle class and to the minimum wage earner. The minimum wage increase will shortly be in their hands. I hope they will be judicious and perhaps even forgo some of their jurisdictional concerns in order to see that this is done for the people of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate's reasonable approach recognizes that small businesses have been the steady engine of our growing economy and that they have been a source of new job creation, and a source of job training. People with no skills often go to work at minimum wage and get the training they need to advance to higher levels of pay and to other more skilled jobs. That is all training which is done for free by small business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate's approach also recognizes that small businesses are middle-class families, too. I am proud that this body has chosen a path which attempts to preserve this segment of the economy, which employs so many working men and women. The Senate has acknowledged the simple fact that a raise in the minimum wage is of no benefit to a worker who doesn't have a job or a job seeker who doesn't have a prospect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this Congress moves forward, we will need to confront a range of issues facing working families: the rising cost of health insurance and the availability of such insurance, the necessity and costs of education and job training, and the desire to achieve an appropriate balance between work and family life. The lessons we have learned in this debate should not be forgotten as we approach new and equally complex issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addressing minimum wage, we have rejected the notion that it will be a clean bill. Ultimately, we did so because it is not a clean issue, it is a very complicated issue, and around here, clean more often than not means "do it my way" and doesn't respect the democratic process of the Senate and allow the Senate to work its will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were claims that no Democrats offered amendments to the bill. That is false. The chairman of the Committee on Small Business, Senator John Kerry, offered two amendments, and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, offered an amendment on "Buy American" standards. In fact, it is my understanding that part of the delay we are experiencing on final passage is that a Democrat was trying to figure out a way to get a vote for a third cloture and a Republican is also trying to do  something very similar. While I believe these have now been resolved, that is kind of what has been holding us up here in waiting for a final vote. Throughout this debate, Members on both sides of the aisle were not aiming to delay passage but were offering amendments to improve the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when I first went into the Wyoming Legislature and presented my first bill, I thought it was a pretty simple bill. It only had three sentences in it. It dealt with unemployment insurance for business owners. Well, this little, simple, three-sentence bill, when it went to committee, got  two amendments, and when it went to the floor, it got three more amendments. When it went to the Senate, it made it out of committee without any additional  amendments but had two more added on the floor. However, what I realized through the process was we had all of these different people from different backgrounds looking at the same problem from different perspectives, and every one of those amendments improved the bill. They looked at the bill and saw things that I hadn't seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Afterwards I hoped that in the future, as I went through the process of legislating, I would see those things and see bills from other people's perspective. But that is the beauty of the system we have here--100 Senators take a look at a bill and 435 people in the House take a look at a bill and that should result in some changes. No bill I have ever seen winds up the same as it started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, sometimes the biggest animosity around here is between the House and the Senate, and that is true in State legislatures, too. I finally figured out the reason for that is we here in the Senate work on a bill, we make it perfect, we send it over there, and they decide something else has to be done to it. That creates animosity. And they do bills and send them here, and we decide there ought to be changes to them, and that creates animosity here. Fortunately, we have a conference committee  process that is supposed to get the two sides together to work out the differences. That also works, although it takes more time. So we are not the fastest in governing, but I think we are the most inclusive in governing. I think this bill has gone through a very similar process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased we have proven to the American people that we can indeed work together and provide solutions to complex and difficult problems. The Senate chose the right course of coupling an  increased minimum wage with provisions that will assist small business employers who will face the greatest difficulties in paying such increased costs. I hope we do not forget the wisdom of this approach as we address other workplace, economic, and social issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been mentioned that 10 years ago when the last minimum wage raise was done, that was the first time there were things put on the bill to offset the impact on small businesses. I was running for office and in Washington at the time that bill was being conferenced and finally debated, and I was pleased to see the former Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Simpson, was the chair on the conference committee, along with Senator Kennedy. The two of them worked out a package that had a raise in  the minimum wage and some offsetting things for small business. When the bill was signed in the Rose Garden, then-President Clinton commented on what a great compromise it was that it would drive our economy. Senator Kennedy received a lot of the compliments for that, as he will this time. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley will be complimented as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't emphasize enough how pleased I am that the two of them worked together to put this tax package together. It is not an easy job. In fact, I think tax provisions are some of the most difficult and complex matters there are to work on. The Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, have worked together on most of the Finance Committee issues. I have noticed through the years that they are most successful when they work together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tried to build on that knowledge when I became the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. It worked well for us for the last 2 years, to work in a very bipartisan way. Almost every issue the Committee had came through this body unanimously. Oh, we had the pension bill, which was a 980-page bill and very complicated and very difficult. And that one wasn't unanimous; it was only 98 to 2. I think my colleagues can see my point on this--that when we work together, we  have amazing things happen in fairly short order. That bill took an hour of debate with two amendments and a final vote, and that was all agreed to before it was even brought to the floor. So when we work together, there can be good things, such as the bill we have right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has chosen the right course of coupling an increased wage with provisions that will assist those small business employers who will face the greatest difficulty in paying those increased costs. I hope we don't forget the wisdom of that approach, as I mentioned before. I am also heartened that in the course of this debate, we have begun to recognize what I know from my own life to be true; that is, that working families are not only those who are employed by businesses, they are also  those who own the businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know from personal experience that all small businesses have two families--their own and the people who work for them. I also know that small business owners feel the pressure of rising costs, the dilemma of difficult options, and the uncomfortable squeeze of modern life in both of their families, as many workers do on their own. And I know that the smaller the business, the more likely it is that the employees and the employers recognize each other's difficulties and how interdependent and  sometimes fragile their businesses and their jobs actually are. I think there is a greater tendency for them to work together under those circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has heard a lot of partisan rhetoric during the course of this debate, such as the talk of the so-called war on the middle class and the claim of leaving people out. I would like to note for the record that such rhetoric got us nowhere. There wasn't an attempt to leave anybody out. The middle class is actually made up of those small businessmen who we are trying to help, and in some cases the employees who are working for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We didn't try to start a war over statistics, although we were tempted. I do have to mention there were some charts out here to show that wages used to be pretty close together, and the chart had five quintiles. I am more used to quartiles than quintiles, but this had five quintiles. So each 20 percent of the wage capability of the population was shown on the chart, and it showed that from 1943 until 1980, the numbers were pretty close together. Then we saw another chart, and it had this bar  on the end which extended far beyond any of the quintiles. I paid a little bit of attention to that chart. It didn't just have quintiles on it; it had quintiles, plus one. If you look at the quintiles, they were almost the same today as they were at the time of the 1943 chart. However this big bar graph at the end--made it look so skewed that it made people look really rich and I guess by association holding the rest of the people down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, instead of just having quintiles on there, the chart had quintiles plus the top 1 percent earners in the United States. I am pretty sure that if you go back to 1943 through whatever date you want and you take the top 1 percent earners in the United States, you will find that they earn drastically more than even the highest quintile. So the chart doesn't treat the wage data equally. I suspect that Bill Gates himself skewed that chart pretty badly. The top 1 percent always makes a lot more  money than everybody else and I think that is pretty much the case through the history of the United States. So if we are going to talk about quintiles, we need to talk about the quintiles equally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is just one example of how we could have spent more time concentrating on the charts and arguing back and forth. But our point wasn't whether to increase the minimum wage; our point was whether we could do it and keep the economy moving by eliminating some of the impact of the increase on the small businesses that employ those minimum wage workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are ending the consideration of this issue basically where it began and for many of us where we have been for the last few years--with the majority of the Senate supporting a minimum wage increase as long as there are provisions to soften the impact of that increase on the small businesses which create minimum wage jobs. Every time I have had to debate this, I have had a bill that had an increase in the minimum wage and it also had some amendments that offset the impact. Now, I didn't take  the Finance Committee offsets; I took some other offsets to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things I have noticed around here is that if you ever do an amendment on a bill like this, it will  be considered a poison pill, and the second time you try to do that bill, even if you have changed the wording, the arguments will be exactly the same as before you changed the wording. So we sometimes get locked into the concept and the history of what has gone on around here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could have had this increase done earlier had there been some willingness to offset it with a package, as was done the last time the minimum wage was increased and as I suspect will happen every time in the future that the minimum wage is increased because a higher wage is of no use when the job itself is gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate chose to look at the whole picture this time around. The minimum wage could have been raised years ago had some on the other side been willing to accept the important role that working families and small businesses--those are a lot of the same people--play in providing employment in this country. Some people like to talk about two Americas. What the Senate is preparing to do today recognizes that there is one America. We are all in this together, and we don't need to do great injury  to one group of Americans just to aid another. That kind of partisan rhetoric isn't accurate, and it is aimed at spreading a very skewed view of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is aimed to divide rather than unite Americans around the simple solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mandating the wage increase without proper relief to the working families who employee many of America's low-skilled workers is an assault on the middle class. Let's get our facts straight. Passing the Senate's bipartisan minimum wage and small business relief package is good for low-skilled workers and it is good for the middle class working families of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time we did this. I hope we will have the vote soon. I look forward to the speeches we can do afterwards, thanking all of the people that have made this possible. I am very confident that is exactly what is going to happen.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I want to say, Senator Kennedy is not here, and I am sorry that is the case. But he spent the last week or two on the Senate floor. I want to express how much I appreciate the attitude and demonstration of bipartisanship shown by Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi. I have said before they are an example of how people with different political philosophies can do things constructive in nature to get us to a point where we are today. They are both  outstanding legislators, and they are very fine individuals, as indicated by their ability to get along on the most contentious issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A person does not have to be disagreeable to disagree. And these two gentlemen certainly epitomize, in my estimation, how we should all work together in spite of our political differences, to work toward a common good to do things that are good for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Senator Enzi, who is here, thank you very much.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to thank both the leaders for their kind words. I thank them on behalf of both Senator Kennedy and myself. We do have a philosophy of working together, and it does work. I am pleased we are at this point today. The bill the Senate has crafted is the right approach to take on this issue. The approach is combining an increase in the minimum wage with provisions that will assist those small business employers who face the greatest difficulties in  paying such increased costs. The Senate has not forgotten that while we may be able to mandate a wage, we cannot mandate the existence of a job. I hope our colleagues in the House will not forget that either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In legislating, it is often important to find a third way. The third way is represented by the substitute amendment that was the product of extensive bipartisan cooperation. Democrats and Republicans working together acknowledged the fact that mandated cost increases can have negative economic effects, and together we developed a means of addressing those concerns in the form of the bipartisan substitute amendment. It will affect millions of Americans. I am glad we are at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank all of the staffs who have been involved in this issue, doing research and getting information that will help us to be as sure as we can be that we have made the right decisions on the best information possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my staff, that includes my staff director, Katherine McGuire, and Brian Hayes, Kyle Hicks, Ilyse Schuman, Amy Shank, Shana Christrup, Andrew Patzman, Randi Reid, Tara Ord, Greg Dean, Craig Orfield, and Michael Mahaffey. That is a lot of people, but it takes a lot of people to do something like the tax package and the bill we have before us, plus all of the other things that were considered during the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the Republican leader's office, I thank Mike Solon, Malloy McDaniel, and Rohit Kumar. I also thank Ed Egee with Senator Isakson. From the Finance committee, I thank Russ Sullivan and Mark Prater; and from the Republican whip's office, Manny Rossman and John O'Neill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would be very remiss if I did not thank those in Senator Kennedy's office and his staff: Michael Myers, Holly Fechner, Portia Wu, Missy Rohrbach, and Lauren McGarity. They have  done just an outstanding job of keeping us on track and also searching through all of the different things we have had to consider, even those that nobody ever saw discussed here on the Senate floor. It was tireless work, which often goes on late into the nights,  well beyond the time Senators are around here--of course, I do not want to give you the impression that Senators are necessarily going home. Sometimes they are working late as well, just in a different building. We get to spend our days here and our nights in our office building. But without the help of all of those people, this bill would not be at the point it is now. We really appreciate their work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, in just a few moments the Senate will vote on the issue of increasing the minimum wage. We have been debating this issue for some time. At the final moments here, I, first of all, thank my friend and colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for his willingness to work together. We do not always agree, but we agree more often than one might expect, and we have gotten good things done in our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always enjoy working with him. We have had some differences on this issue, but we always know we have a good deal of respect for each other; I certainly for him. I know it is not appropriate to make personal comments on the floor of the Senate, but I am, in any event.

    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Just finally, I think those of us who are in this Chamber understand we want to be one country with one history and one destiny. We want to make sure that for all people, in all parts of our Nation, they are going to have a part of the American dream. We, as a nation, do not want to have a subclass, a subclass of workers who cannot emerge out of a minimum wage for themselves or for their families. We recognize that work has to pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are trying to do with the increase in the minimum wage is to say to men and women of dignity--primarily to women because women are the greatest recipients of the minimum wage, to their families and their children, to men and women of color--that we understand if you work hard in the country that has the strongest economy in the world, you should not have to live in poverty. You should not have to live in poverty. And raising the minimum wage is going to help to make sure that particularly  those children--those 6 million children--are going to have a more hopeful future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, we want to send a very important message to all of those children. This is really just the beginning. We have a change in direction in this country, as we have seen in the House of Representatives and here in the Senate. And we want to give assurances to those families that hopefully are going to get some boost in the minimum wage that we are going to work on the education for those children. We are going to work to make sure they are going to get the kind of help and assistance  so that education is going to be available to them. We are going to work to make sure we get a reauthorization of the SCHIP program, an expansion of the Medicaid Programs, because we want to make sure they are going to be healthy, they are going to have the opportunities for education. We are going to make sure as well, to the extent we can, they are going to be able to live in safe and secure neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a responsibility in this country of ours to make sure--particularly for children in this Nation, but for workers in this country--that their work is going to be recognized, respected, and they are going to be treated justly and fairly. That is what the minimum wage is all about. It is a moral issue, as the members of the church have all told us about. And we, hopefully, will get a resounding vote of support for a long-awaited increase in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, we have now spent 8 long days debating whether to raise the minimum wage by $2.10 per hour. During this time, we have had quite a bit to say about quite a variety of issues. We have talked about education. We have talked about heath care. We have talked about tax policy and immigration policy. We have actually talked very little about raising the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not had nearly enough debate about what this bill would actually do, so I can honestly say that I am pleased when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle come down the floor with the intent of actually talking about the Fair Minimum Wage Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, while I applaud them for addressing the issue at hand, their criticisms of the Fair Minimum Wage Act are woefully misplaced. My Republican colleagues are perpetuating some of the most common misconceptions about raising the minimum wage, and it is important to set the record straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, raised concerns about the private sector costs of raising the minimum wage. He argued that an increase will prove detrimental to the economy in general, or to the business community in specific. He is correct that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill will cost the private sector more than $10 billion over 5 years. However, this is a mere drop in the bucket of the national payroll. All Americans combined earn $5.4  trillion a year. A minimum wage increase to $7.25 would be less than one-fifth of 1 percent of this national payroll--far too trivial to cause inflation or other economic harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The simple fact is that employers can afford to increase wages in the current economy. Workers are producing more, but earning less. Productivity has increased by 31 percent since 1997, yet minimum-wage workers have not received a raise. This increase ensures that minimum-wage workers, not just employers, benefit from the fruits of their labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now Senator Alexander also suggests that we shouldn't interfere with the market forces that set wages for low-wage workers. But we need to intervene when there's a market failure that needs correcting, and that's clearly the case with our stagnant minimum wage. Low-skilled workers, unlike high-skilled workers, do not generally have the bargaining power to demand wage increases. Even if they work harder, all their extra efforts are going into profits. Corporate profits have grown by 80  percent since Bush took office, while wages are stagnant. We need to act to make sure minimum wage workers don't get left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague also expresses concern about the effect of a minimum wage on small business. He claims that the majority of minimum wage workers are employed by small businesses, and that small businesses will suffer if the minimum wage is raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the small business community doesn't agree. A recent Gallup poll found that 80 percent of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business, and three out of four small businesses said that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company. Additionally, nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased, and only 16 percent of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, historical evidence suggests that a minimum wage increase can actually be beneficial to small business. A 2005 study by the Fiscal Policy Institute found States with minimum wages above the Federal level are generating more small businesses than states with a minimum wage at the Federal level. Between 1998 and 2003, the number of small businesses rose 5.4 percent in the ten States, including at had a minimum wage higher than the Federal level, compared to 4.2 percent in the other 40  States. The number of small retail businesses also grew faster in these States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Senator Alexander's concerns about the economic impacts of a minimum wage raise, those concerns are misguided. The economic  doomsday scenario that Senator Alexander predicts simply will not materialize from this long-overdue increase in the minimum wage. The Senator doesn't have  to take my word for it--over 650 prominent economists, including 5 Nobel Prize winners, agree that a modest increase in the minimum wage--like the one proposed in the Fair Minimum Wage Act--"can significantly improve the lives of low-income workers and their families, without the adverse effects that critics have claimed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to arguing about the economic impacts this bill, several of my colleagues have argued that raising the minimum wage is not an effective anti-poverty program, but instead will benefit primarily secondary earners and families well above the poverty line. This counterintuitive assertion is not borne out by the facts. The vast majority of minimum wage workers are hard-working Americans struggling to get by on what the minimum wage pays them for their contribution to our economy. And that  is not easy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A minimum wage increase benefits poor American families. According to the Economic Policy Institute, almost 70 percent of those who would benefit are adult workers, not teenagers seeking pocket change. Nearly half of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families. Nearly 40 percent of the benefits from a minimum wage increase would go to households with an average annual income of less than $17,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to remember that those earning the minimum wage are not just starting out in the workforce. Many hardworking people become trapped in low-paying jobs and have trouble getting ahead. A report from the Center for Economic Policy Research shows a third of minimum wage earners from ages 25 and 54 will still be earning the minimum wage three years later. Only 40 percent of them will have moved out of the low-wage workforce 3 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly raising the minimum wage is only one of many steps that we should take to address the problem of poverty in this nation. Several of my Republican colleagues have suggested that we should examine ways to improve the Earned Income Tax Credit, and I look forward to working with them on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But none of this changes the fundamental fact that the Federal minimum wage is at its lowest real value in 50 years and continues to fall further and further behind each day. Minimum wage workers have been waiting longer than ever before in history for an increase, and a raise is long-overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my colleague from South Carolina, Senator DeMint, went so far as to suggest that raising the minimum wage will actually harm poor workers, because it will cause them to lose other government benefits. That's just not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fair Minimum Wage Act will bring working families out of poverty. The minimum wage increase--plus food stamps and the earned income tax credit--brings a family of four with one minimum wage earner from 11 percent below the poverty line to 5 percent above the poverty line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now it's true that some minimum wage workers may lose a portion of their food stamp benefits, but their increased earnings and the increased benefits they receive through the earned income tax credit will more than offset any loss of benefits and provide  them with additional flexibility to meet their family's needs. They will also remain eligible for housing assistance and other essential government programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minimum wage workers will also benefit from a raise in the long run. They will be earning higher wages, paying more into Social Security, and ultimately receiving more in retirement and disability benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I'd like to address some comments made just this morning by my colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY. Now as Senator GRASSLEY knows, I have always taken the position that we should do this minimum wage bill "clean"--without any add-ons or tax giveaways. Because it's just a myth that minimum wage increases hurt the business community, there is certainly no need to pay off the business community when we give minimum wage workers a raise. We've raised the minimum wage nine  times since the Fair Minimum Wage act was enacted in 1938, and only once have we included a tax package for business. That was during the Clinton administration--an era when we had substantial government surpluses, not the dramatic deficits we're facing now. It's just not responsible to pass unnecessary tax giveaways in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admit that the tax package contained in the Baucus substitute is not particularly large or offensive, and I understand that it's something we'll likely have to take to get this bill done. But I don't support it, and I certainly don't support any additional tax giveaways being added to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator GRASSLEY suggested this morning that tax breaks are a necessary part of any increase in the minimum wage. I would remind the Senator that an overwhelming bipartisan majority in both Houses of the Iowa State Legislature just voted to increase the Iowa state minimum wage to $7.25--the same level provided in this bill--with no tax breaks included. The Senator's State leaders hold the same views as a majority of the U.S. Congress--that minimum wage workers deserve an immediate raise,  with no strings attached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that these comments lay to rest the fears of my Republican colleagues. I hope that they can join me in supporting a fair increase in the minimum wage for hardworking Americans across the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, after great effort by many people, the Senate has adopted the Fair Minimum Wage Act as amended by the Baucus substitute amendment containing the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007. This bipartisan small business package will help ensure that small businesses are able to cope with an increase in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Credit must go to the dedicated members of my staff, who spent many hours helping to put this package together.

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to applaud the Senate for its keen sense of balance and judgment in passing <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, a bill to increase the minimum wage. After important input from both sides, we have met the needs of both America's workers, who will earn a higher wage, and America's small businesses, which fuel our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President and the Republican Congress were clear on the need to couple an increase in the minimum wage with small-business tax relief, and this legislation does just that. This is a testament to what we can accomplish when we work together to move critical legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people that keep this economy running have created more than 7.2 million new jobs since August 2003--that's 40 months straight of job growth. The economy added 167,000 new jobs last December, exceeding market expectations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our unemployment rate is a staggeringly low 4.5 percent or as I like to put it, our employment rate is 95.5 percent. A 4.5 percent unemployment rate is lower than the 5.1 percent average unemployment rate of 2005, which was already a great year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And a low rate of 4.5 percent is lower than the average unemployment rate of the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and even lower than the average unemployment rate of the boom years my friends on the other side of the aisle like to point to, the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's small businesses are the key to unlocking this economic success. Small businesses employ half of all private-sector employees and have generated between 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually over the last 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's the bottom line. Since August 2003, the American people have created over 7.2 million new jobs, more than the entire European Union plus Japan combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So understandably, this side of the aisle had this objective in mind regarding this bill: What is the best way to raise the minimum wage while keeping our high-flying economy aloft?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How could we encourage economic growth and not hinder it? How could we make sure that an increase in wages wouldn't create a decrease in jobs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Senate has successfully done that, by linking an increase in the hourly minimum wage, from $5.15 to $7.25 over slightly more than 2 years, with targeted tax and regulatory relief to small businesses, so that the small businesses that create the lion's share of new jobs in this country can remain competitive and employ even more people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President last December emphasized the need to pair minimum wage increase legislation with just this kind of targeted tax and regulatory relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my initial speech to the Senate of the 110th Congress last month, I said we Republicans were open and willing to get things done with Democrats. And I said one of the first goals we should accomplish, working together, was increasing the minimum wage while providing relief for small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Around the same time, the distinguished majority leader struck a similar note, pledging that when it came to a wage increase plus small-business tax relief, "we are going to do it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to report that we have done it. An overwhelming majority of Senators acknowledged that creating new jobs and expanding the economy are more important than partisan wrangling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And most importantly, we have taken care of the workers who will benefit from a higher wage and the small businesses that grow the economy at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased this Senate is doing that, and in doing so reinforcing a vital precedent. I note that the last time the minimum wage was increased, under a Republican Congress and a Democrat President, the same precedent was set.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to working with the House of Representatives to send a final bill to the President that will be a victory for both those who earn the minimum wage and those who pay it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When that happens, we will prove that the words of bipartisanship and comity during this Senate's first days were more than empty rhetoric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will demonstrate that this Senate can come together to exercise balance and judgment, and improve the lives of both the workers who earn the minimum wage and the small businesses that employ them and keep America's economy running.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we will show that divided government need not be divisive.</paragraph>
