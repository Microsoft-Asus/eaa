    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if Washington Democrats get their way, millions of Americans will see their taxes go up by billions of dollars. In a Gallup Poll released earlier this week, 53 percent of the American people said their Federal income taxes were too high, yet the Democrat leadership has decided to move forward with the highest tax increase in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an editorial by the Wall Street Journal, they said, "A tax increase of that magnitude could well lead to a recession and a plunge in receipts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take these examples as evidence that letting the Republican tax cuts expire would only wreak havoc on millions of American checkbooks. Over 115 million taxpayers would see a $1,716 increase in their tax bill in 2011. For 84 million women, it would be an increase of over $1,900. And for 42 million families with children, an increase of over $2,000 would become a scary reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chasing increased spending with higher taxes is not the path of fiscal responsibility and will not lead to further economic prosperity. These tax cuts should not and cannot be allowed to expire.</paragraph>
