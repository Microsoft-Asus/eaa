    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the U.S. attorneys legislation, <bill type="s" number="214">S. 214</bill>, and conclude the final 90 minutes of debate on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At approximately 11:30, there will be three rollcall votes to complete action on the bill: Votes on two amendments and then passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the conclusion of ordering passage on the bill, the Senate will recess for our weekly work conferences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the caucus lunch, we will begin consideration of the budget resolution. Yesterday, I was going to ask unanimous consent to begin at 2:15, but I was informed there might be a request for a rollcall vote on the motion to proceed. That is a nondebatable motion, so we will vote immediately at 2:15 on that matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as the Democrats' time on this matter, relating to U.S. attorneys, the allocation of time on this side will be Senator Schumer, 5 minutes; Senator Murray, 5 minutes; Senator Cardin, 5 minutes; Senator Klobuchar, 5 minutes; Senator Feinstein, 5 minutes; and the balance of the time will be under the control of Senator Leahy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be the case.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
