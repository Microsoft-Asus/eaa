    <paragraph>Mr. President, it was my intent to ask consent to proceed to the budget resolution at 2:15. I am informed that a vote may be required to proceed to the measure. I will not ask for consent tonight. Members are alerted it might be necessary to have a rollcall vote on the motion to proceed to the budget resolution at 2:15 tomorrow afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have had good debate on the pending U.S. attorneys bill. We will continue that debate tomorrow morning and then vote with respect to the two amendments and passage of the bill. The first vote will occur at about 11:30 tomorrow morning.</paragraph>
