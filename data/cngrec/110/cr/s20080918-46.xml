    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Tommy L. Harbour, a fellow West Virginian from Milton. He is a shining example of the self sacrifice and willingness to serve that is an important part of the culture of West Virginia. I am privileged to represent him and share his story with you today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tommy Harbour proudly served his country during World War II. He joined the Coast Guard on July 5, 1943, where he was assigned to the USS Bayfield and served on the landing craft PA33-4. During the invasion of Normandy, Mr. Harbour's landing craft first helped reinforce Omaha Beach with soldiers before making several more landings on Utah Beach under constant gunfire from several fortified German positions. After the European campaign was over, Tommy continued to serve in the Pacific  Theater. He and his fellow soldiers played crucial roles in the invasion of Iwo Jima and the invasion of Okinawa in 1945.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the war, Tommy Harbour was honorably discharged on May 27, 1946, when he returned home to Milton, WV. Tommy went on to once again answer the call of duty, serving as the mayor of Milton for 17 years. During his time as mayor, Tommy showed strong commitment to helping those he served. Mr. Harbour had a reputation for thoroughly examining the issues before him and ensuring the best possible course of action was taken. As mayor, Tommy was approachable and always willing to listen to people's  thoughts and concerns. The enhancements he helped orchestrate, such as flood protection and improving the police department, will be attributes to Milton for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tommy Harbour is an outstanding American and a true West Virginian. He is a perfect model of the impact one man can have. Mr. Harbour has lived a life of service, always giving and never asking for anything in return. This story of his bravery and willingness to serve his community is a great example of the accomplishments we are all capable of and I hope it has inspired my fellow colleagues and individuals nationwide.</paragraph>
