  <narrative>CONGRATULATING CHESHIRE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS SWIM TEAM -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11758]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know, we live in a world that's hard to reconcile sometimes. Now, our focus often is on the evil that exists in this world, but all too often we let that focus overwhelm the counterbalancing good things that happen in our communities every day. And I rise today to recognize that strange, delicate symmetry in my hometown of Cheshire, Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the Cheshire High School girls swim team broke the record for the longest dual-meet winning streak in American history with their 235th straight victory. As you can imagine, this is a pretty remarkable record to break. In fact, the girls on this record-breaking swim team that broke the record on Monday night weren't even alive when that streak began some 21 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wasn't there Monday night, unfortunately, but hundreds of parents and friends and siblings and supporters were in attendance, and I heard that the record-breaking night was pretty magical. But strangely, something else happened that night, something that the girls probably didn't even notice or seek out. Monday night, the girls swim team at Cheshire High School transcended statistics and records and wins and losses. And the most important marker that they set down that night was not as the  best swim team in the country, but as a bright, beaming emblem of a resurgent community with so much to celebrate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, my town has been grieving over the past several months. And it's hard to figure out what else to do when you wake up one morning and find out that three of your neighbors, a mother and her two young, vibrant daughters, lost their lives in an unspeakable act of barbarism. It becomes difficult, impossible even, to square the wonderful, serene existence of life in a quiet small town with the random and brutal acts of violence that left Dr. William Petit mourning the unexplainable loss of  his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do you reconcile the two? How do you wake up, even for those of us who didn't know the family personally or live in that neighborhood, and pretend that the veil of safety and goodness that always seemed to envelop Cheshire, Connecticut, was still there after that? I thought about little else in the days and weeks following that incident, and I know that I wasn't alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then the unexpected happens. And I know it sounds silly to even talk about a murder and a swim team in the same sentence and, frankly, of course, the two are incomparable, but therein lies the problem. There is no and there will be no one clear moment when we collectively decide that the moral order has been restored in our community. And so we're left to seek out those moments that simply remind us of why we love Cheshire in the first place and why we have confidence that our community will  heal, that we will persevere, and that we will recover. This week is one of those moments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't grow up in Cheshire, so I certainly can't claim to know the town like those who call it their birthplace, but I did know a good thing when I found it. And Tuesday morning, when I heard that the record had broken, I couldn't help but wonder whether it wasn't just a coincidence that a national record 21 years in the making matured at the very moment that a burst of good news was most needed in our community. And I couldn't help but think about how this streak, which started two decades  ago and has been the careful construction of hundreds of girls and thousands more family members, friends, supporters and coaches stands as a testament to the strength, persistence and spirit of our little town, not just on one night, but over the span of decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, yes, one unspeakable act can and probably should shake the confidence and faith of a community. And  nothing will ever repair that damage, certainly not for the Petit family, and probably not entirely for the community that they call home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we're left to look for those moments of triumph, those instances of community reaffirmation that remind us why Cheshire is such a special place to live. Well, we found one this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Cheshire High School girls swim team and to thank them for everything that they have done. Cheshire is a pretty special place to live, and Monday night reminded us of why that is.</paragraph>
