    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week the National Intelligence Estimate report stated that al Qaeda is the most serious threat to the U.S. homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday President Bush flew to my home State of South Carolina to speak to troops in Charleston. In his speech he reminded the Nation of the threat that al Qaeda poses to our Nation and the stability of Iraq. The threat is real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to share with you a Fourth of July blog entry from Lieutenant Colonel Clarence Bowser, who is currently serving with the South Carolina National Guard in Kandahar, Afghanistan:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I am so proud of my service here and to this Nation. I don't know the politics; I'll leave that to the politicians. But it is my prayer for their leadership and that we as a Nation do the right thing for this country and Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my hope and my prayer is that we as politicians have the courage to do the same: win this fight.</paragraph>
