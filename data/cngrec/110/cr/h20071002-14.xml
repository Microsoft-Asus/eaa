  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the peaceful protestors in Burma deserve our support, and the brutal generals in charge of the SPDC must be held accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reports on the number of deaths ordered by the dictatorship range from hundreds to thousands. It's difficult to get specific numbers, particularly as other reports detail the regime burning dead bodies so that no one can get an accurate count of the dead and disappeared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One new image shows the badly bruised and semi-dressed body of a Buddhist monk floating face down in the Rangoon River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The regime has also no respect for journalists. A Japanese journalist was shot point blank by the dictator's troops, and the regime detained other journalists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One senior Burmese intelligence official is claiming that thousands of protesters are dead, and the bodies of hundreds of executed monks have been dumped in the jungle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do everything possible to press the regime to stop the killing and detentions. This includes sanctions against the regime, specifically freezing bank accounts of members of the dictatorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Burma deserve to live in peace and freedom.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
