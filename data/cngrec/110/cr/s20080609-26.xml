  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="Introducing S. 3102. A bill to establish the Small Business Information Security Task Force, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3102">S. 3102</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator John Kerry, to introduce the Small Business Information Security Act of 2008. Not only is this a bipartisan bill in the United States Senate, but it is also a bicameral bill. Congressmen Manzullo and Michaud are also introducing companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. This bill would establish within the Small Business Administration, SBA, a Small Business Information Security Task Force to advise  the SBA and help small businesses both understand the unique information security challenges they face, and identify resources to help meet those challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, one of my goals is to ensure small businesses are protected from the mounting information security threats they face every day. This legislation will create a clearinghouse of information, resources, and tools--compiled by a task force consisting of public and private sector experts in the field--that will ease the complexity, confusion, and cost often associated with enhancing information security measures within  a small business. The task force will continually update information and resources as new technologies and threats arise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, small business owners turn to the SBA for resources regarding a number of aspects, but information security resources remain largely unavailable within the agency. This legislation will present an opportunity for the SBA to develop and create a repository of data to help small business owners meet their information security needs. This legislation will enable industry experts to come together and immediately provide meaningful strategies to enable small businesses to safeguard their  customer's personal information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Computer networks are increasingly susceptible to hackers, intruders, and other cyber criminals. In fact, in my home state of Maine, the retail supermarket chain, Hannaford Bros., was recently affected by an intrusion into their computer system which led to the exposure of 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers. What many people do not realize is that a breach like Hannaford's impacts not only the millions of customers whose personal data was compromised, but it also has serious downstream  impact on our Nation's small businesses. For example, throughout Maine there are many small banks; these banks are responsible for protecting and alerting their depositors upon fraudulent activity. Following the Hannaford breach, many small banks had to replace their customers' credit and debit cards, clearly a costly enterprise that diverts resources from more productive activities, such as small business lending. The bill we are introducing today will help ameliorate this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, these attacks are becoming more frequent and more severe, and the perpetrators are becoming harder to identify and bring to justice. According to a survey by the Small Business Technology Institute, more than half of all small businesses in the U.S. experienced a security breach in the last year. Furthermore, the study concludes that nearly one-fifth of small businesses do not use virus-scanning for e-mail, over 60 percent do not protect their wireless networks with encryption,  and two-thirds of small businesses do not have an information security plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As these statistics illustrate, small businesses are increasingly at risk of data breaches and other forms of malicious attacks on their information technology infrastructure. Cyber attacks launched by a small group of people can devastate America financially, it is conceivable that a few individuals working together could disable millions of computers at a cost of hundreds of millions to the U.S. economy. Cyber-criminals can hold hostage not just a few individuals, but millions of small businesses.  This legislation provides best practices to help small business owners decrease the risk cyber attacks pose to their customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The information security threat posed to our Nation's small businesses is serious, and our efforts to prevent and reduce this risk carry a tremendous sense of urgency. We must continue to focus on ways we can protect small businesses, and their customers, from the serious consequences of cyber crimes. In order to take an important first step, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this critical legislation, and I hope we can see this commonsense legislation enacted into law as expeditiously  as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="Introducing S. 3103. A bill to amend the Iran, North Korea, and Syria nonproliferation Act to allow certain extraordinary payments in connection with the International Space Station; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3103">S. 3103</bill>] Today Senator Lugar and I introduce, by request, the International Space Station Payments Act of 2008. This measure would enable the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to continue payments to Russia related to the International Space Station after 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with any legislation proposed by request, we introduce this bill for the purpose of placing the Executive branch's proposals before Congress and the public without expressing our own views on the substance of the proposals. As chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, we intend to give the administration's requested legislation careful review and consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administrator of NASA, Michael Griffin, has submitted this legislation to the committee, along with a section-by-section analysis that helps to explain why NASA wants this legislation and what they believe it will achieve. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative/>
  <narrative/>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, April 11, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) proposes the enclosed amendment to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (50 USC 1701 note). The purpose of the amendment is to permit NASA to continue to procure Russian support for the International Space Station (ISS) until suitable U.S. capabilities are in place. We urge enactment of this important amendment.</narrative>
  <narrative>The amendment provides a balanced approach, maintaining both U.S. nonproliferation principles and objectives as well as a U.S. presence on ISS. The justification and purpose for this proposed amendment are stated more fully in the enclosed sectional analysis. As an overview, NASA has procured Soyuz services through the fall of 2011, consistent with existing authority under the Act. However, U.S. obligations to provide crew transportation and emergency services to the ISS continue beyond 2011,  and Soyuz will be the only viable option for the United States to meet these obligations until the U.S. Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle or U.S. commercial providers can provide such transportation and rescue services. Fabrication of Soyuz vehicles must begin approximately 36 months prior to launch, according to the responsible Russian entities. Thus, unless</narrative>
  <narrative>The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the submission of this legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The Administration remains committed to the important objective of persuading the Russian Government and Russian entities to improve their nonproliferation efforts regarding Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Accordingly, the proposed amendment to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (the Act) would maintain key existing U.S. nonproliferation tools while allowing payments to Russian entities that support U.S. obligations to the International Space Station (ISS) beyond December 31,  2011.</narrative>
  <narrative>The provision would extend the Act's exception to the prohibition on "extraordinary payments" to the Russian government and Russian entities for goods or services relating to the ISS from January 1, 2012 to the end of the life of the ISS. It would exclude from the exception any payments after December 31, 2011 for cargo services provided by a Progress vehicle. The new provision would also exclude from the exception payments for crew transportation or rescue services provided by a Soyuz vehicle  once (1) the U.S. Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle reaches Full Operational Capability or (2) a U.S. commercial provider of crew transportation and rescue services demonstrates the capability to meet ISS mission requirements.</narrative>
  <narrative>An international partnership governed by an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) among the United States, Canada, multiple European States, Japan and Russia established the ISS. This partnership is a long-standing and interdependent one, with roles and responsibilities outlined in the IGA and subordinate agreements for design, development and operations of the program. Pursuant to the IGA and subordinate agreements, NASA has an obligation to its non-Russian ISS Partners to provide crew rotation  and rescue services during the life of the ISS. Currently, the Russian vehicle Soyuz is the sole provider of rescue services, with the Space Shuttle providing crew transportation. After Shuttle retirement, the partnership will be dependent on Russia to provide both crew transportation and rescue services with Soyuz</narrative>
  <narrative>NASA has procured Soyuz services through the fall of 2011, consistent with existing authority under the Act. Fabrication of Soyuz vehicles must begin approximately 36 months prior to launch based upon information provided by the Russian entities responsible for manufacturing these vehicles. Thus, unless contractual arrangements for rescue and crew rotation services after 2011 are concluded in 2008, the production of Soyuz vehicles for U.S. crew transfer and rescue will be at risk. This in turn  means that prompt legislative action is needed to provide further relief beyond 2011 and allow for the negotiation of these arrangements.</narrative>
  <narrative>Absent the proposed relief, the United States will be unable to meet one of its most critical partner obligations: providing crew transportation and rescue services to European, Japanese and Canadian crews. The United States would not have an American "presence" aboard the ISS, either in terms of astronauts or access to research facilities for the U.S. scientific community, if we could not purchase crew transportation and rescue services from Russia, as no non-Russian crew transfer vehicles  will be available until the CEV reaches full operational capability or a U.S. commercial provider demonstrates the capability to meet ISS crew transportation and rescue needs. Given NASA's operational, engineering, safety and other responsibilities for the ISS, NASA is concerned whether the ISS could remain fully operational for any significant time period absent an American presence.</narrative>
  <narrative>Moreover, the authority under the present exception to the Act has been used to obtain ancillary goods and services from Russia in addition to crew transport and rescue. For example, although purchased from Russia, the Zarya module is legally a U.S. element under the Space Station agreements and NASA must purchase unique tools and engineering support, such as sustaining software, from Russia for the continued operation of the module. NASA will have a continuing requirement to procure certain  goods and services where Russia offers unique capabilities, such as those related to Russian space suits, software and hardware engineering support, and Extravehicular Activity tools and training, which are required for effective operations onboard the ISS. This amendment will allow NASA to continue to purchase such goods and services that are necessary to meet U.S. responsibilities under the Space Station Agreements.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, this limited relief being requested (i.e., through the life of the ISS) may be necessary even after a U.S. commercial capability is available, because some potential U.S. commercial providers of cargo services and of crew transportation and rescue services have Russian contractors or other relationships with Russian entities that, without this amendment, could trigger the Act's "extraordinary payment" prohibition.</narrative>
  <narrative>With respect to furthering the United States' nonproliferation objectives and tools, in addition to the positive incentive provided by prudent, closely monitored space cooperation in areas of great benefit to the United States, the proposed amendment would not affect the current nonproliferation framework. The first five sections of the Act establish a requirement to report to Congress on every foreign person that transfers controlled items to, or acquires controlled items from, Iran, Syria or  North Korea and authorizes sanctions against such foreign persons. These key reporting and sanctions provisions would not be affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, the amendment leaves in place the ban on any United States government agency making extraordinary payments in connection with the ISS or other human space flight to any persons (including entities) subject to sanctions under the Act or the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Executive Order (E.O. 12938, as amended by E.O. 13094)</narrative>
