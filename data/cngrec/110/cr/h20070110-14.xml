    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak briefly about the issue that my good friend from Burbank, Mr. Schiff, did, and that is the issue of minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am well aware of the fact that 80 percent of the American people believe we should increase the minimum wage, and I am for everyone's wage being increased. I want those who are struggling to get on the first rung of the economic ladder to have every opportunity possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I think it is very important that as we prepare to embark on this debate on the minimum wage, that we focus on the most important item that we face and that was raised by Mr. Schiff, that being the issue of our being the richest economy in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is not by accident. It is because of policies that we have put into place that are doing everything we can to ensure economic growth. So that is why as we look at this issue of making sure that people  who are dealing with economic challenges, we need to make sure that job creation is priority number one. And that is why focusing on reducing the tax and regulatory burden on those who are creating jobs should be priority number one.</paragraph>
