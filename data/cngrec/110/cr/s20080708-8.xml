    <paragraph>Mr. President, 232 years ago the Declaration of Independence established that humans have the right to self-government because of their unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Preserving these principles requires the same wisdom, courage and spirit of sacrifice that characterized many 18th century Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"What will our children say," wrote Boston attorney Josiah Quincy II in 1768, "When they read the history of these times, should they find we tamely gave away, without one noble struggle, the most invaluable of earthly blessings? ..... let us ..... swear we will die, if we cannot live freemen!"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the Americans chose to fight nobly and courageously. After the British surrender at the Battle of Saratoga, Lord Chatham, a member of the British House of Lords, concluded, "I know that the conquest of English America is an impossibility. You cannot, I venture to say it, you cannot conquer America ....."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These principles to which the representatives of the 13 colonies pledged their lives, their resources, and their honor still apply to our Nation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was on this day, July 8, 1776, that the Declaration of Independence was first read publicly, having been unanimously adopted by the Congress only 4 days before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, today, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Lieberman in starting a new, bipartisan tradition in the U.S. Senate. We will read the Declaration of Independence again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the next hour, we will also hear from important leaders in our Nation's history who saw these principles of liberty, equality, and justice as timeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patrick Henry urges us to consider the consequences of weakly submitting to a tyrannical authority in the hopes of obtaining peace, rather than persisting in the fight to secure our freedom. In his famous speech at the Touro Synagogue, George Washington establishes the importance of religious freedom for the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few days before his inauguration, Abraham Lincoln makes an impromptu speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where he argues that the principles of the Declaration are incompatible with slavery. Finally, in his last letter, Thomas Jefferson reflects on the significance of the Declaration and its timeless value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lieberman and myself may enter into a colloquy on the reading of the Declaration of Independence and that following our colloquy, Senators Whitehouse, Murkowski, Webb, Martinez, and Lieberman be, in that order, speakers for the remainer of morning business.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it; and to institute  new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</paragraph>

We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.----"</paragraph>
