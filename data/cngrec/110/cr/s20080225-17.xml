  <narrative>ASSURED FUNDING FOR VETERANS HEALTH CARE ACT -- (Senate - February 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1115">S1115</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on February 14, 2008, I was pleased to introduce the Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act, along with my colleague Senator Snowe. This legislation is the companion bill to legislation introduced in the House by Representative Phil Hare, with a number of cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will make spending for the VA health care system mandatory, rather than discretionary. Under this legislation, the base-line funding year would be 130 percent of the fiscal year 2006 VA health care budget. This amount would be adjusted annually to reflect the total number of veterans participating in the VA health care system and would account for the annual rise in the cost of providing health care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1996 to 2003, the enrolled VA patient population increased 134 percent. Appropriated funding, however, only increased 44 percent. These discrepancies are intolerable. We must give the VA the funding it needs to provide our service men and women with the quality health care they deserve and were promised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I was pleased to help secure full funding for the VA for the first time in 21 years. The Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act is needed, however, to ensure that this is a regular occurrence. Our veterans deserve to know that Congress will provide for their health care needs and will not subject them to the whims of the annual appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation enjoys the support of every major military and veterans association, including the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of American, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I commend this legislation to the attention of my colleagues and urge them to lend their support by cosponsoring this bill.</paragraph>
