  <narrative>UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--TITLE I OF <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> -- (Senate - September 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9174">S9174</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a bill at the desk which is word for word identical to title I of our bill, which is the health care provisions. I ask unanimous-consent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the bills at the desk, which consists of title I of <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>, the health care title of that bill, the bill be read three times and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will object on behalf of Senator Coburn, I would note two things: First, that we do not have to wait until 7 o'clock tonight. I came over to the Chamber so the majority leader could posit his unanimous-consent requests and there would be somebody here to speak on behalf of my colleague Senator Coburn. That is why I am here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, as I said, some of these bills, there are eight of them, that Senator Coburn has said, let's pass them right now. We do not have to go through the whole rigmarole of filing cloture and 30 hours of debate and all of the things the majority leader talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One or two of those are on the list he spoke about. There are eight in total here. So I would note that it boils down to "take it or leave it," either all 35 or none, whereas Senator Coburn's view is that some of these bills could be passed without the necessity of filing cloture; let's just do it. But he and the majority leader have not been able to agree on which ones they are. Therefore, the objection must be made.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, through the Chair, then are you saying that if I offer unanimous-consent on the Stop Stroke Act, the Mothers Act, ALS Registry, Downs Syndrome Support, Christopher Reeves, do these individually, that you will allow those to pass?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my understanding that there are eight bills on the list Senator Coburn has developed that do not need modification. There are three, at least, one of which was mentioned, the ALS Registry, that he believe need changes. I assume he and the majority leader have discussed that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>So you say there are eight we can pass right now?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think it is important, since I am speaking on behalf of another Senator, that staffs make sure what I have said is accurate. But my understanding is there are eight bills Senator Coburn has no objection to proceeding with. Obviously, he and the majority leader, you and he have been discussing how to put these together and get them done, but there may be changes necessary in the ALS Registry and Emmett Till Unresolved Civil Rights Crime Act, and the Protect Our  Children.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>So what I say, if there are eight of them that we can pass, let's do it right now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I am speaking on behalf of someone else. I want to make sure what I have represented here is accurate. I am perfectly willing at this time to get the two staffs together to see if that can be done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say respectfully, our staffs have spent, with his staff, unending hours. And I will be anxious to see, whenever he shows up, because it is always, when you get right down to it, you cannot do it. If there are eight we can do right now, let's do them right now; do them one at a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will ask unanimous-consent. We will do them right now. The ones we cannot do, we will wait until next year when we get a new Congress and a new President. And the people who are sick and need this help will have to wait until we have a Congress that is willing to pass those.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in further clarifying with staff, we know there are some that could be cleared right now, at least three. There are others where someone else has posed an objection, and I do not know who that might be, or which side it is on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But our staff indicates if the two staffs can get together, they think at least on some of these it can be resolved very quickly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have gone in the last minutes--this is what I have dealt with--from eight to three. I will take the three. What are the three?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with all due respect, that is not fair to what I said. I am not in the middle of this. There are staff on both sides who have been working on these. My understanding is that Senator Coburn is not the sole objector with respect to some. There are three where he was the sole objector. He is willing to let them go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot speak to anyone else, to whatever objections might exist. But staff informs me they believe if we were to sit down and have the two staffs of the majority and minority work together, that perhaps up to eight of these bills could be cleared today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say with all due respect to my friend, the junior Senator from Arizona, he is in the middle of this. Every Republican Senator is in the middle of this, because we could not move forward on these bills previously. So you cannot--because someone is objecting, it does not mean that is grounds for your not being a part of it. People on the Republican side of the aisle voted overwhelmingly not to move forward. So I tell you what, Mr. President. I will be happy to take the  suggestion of my friend from Arizona. In the next hour or so we will sit down, my staff--I do not know about Senator Coburn's staff, maybe they are in Oklahoma also. But we will be happy to sit down and work to get some of these bills passed, so I will return at a later time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the majority leader indulge me one moment here? My staff has indicated there are four ready to go right now. I will read the title and then your staff will have those. One is the Prenatal Conditions Bill; another is the Child Pornography bill, that is <bill type="s" number="4136">S. 4136</bill>; another relates to Child Pornography, <bill type="s" number="4120">S. 4120</bill>; and then there is a House message accompanying <bill type="s" number="496">S. 496</bill>. Apparently all four of those are ready to go. That is the Appalachian Development bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>We will take the first three. Let me think about this for a moment. Are these all Republican bills?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will do them all, except for the Appalachian whatever it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the majority leader wishes, I will ask unanimous-consent----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>And the language has not been changed in any way?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me combine the three then to make it simpler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent, since these are different committees----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I can interrupt my friend, there are a couple different versions of the bills floating around. On these three, which I am very happy to get done, we will make sure that the minority and majority staff agree it is the right piece of legislation so we do not make another mistake.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>What we will do is have your staff confirm that this is, in fact, the version, and then either you or I or someone else can ask unanimous-consent to clear these three bills?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>We will wait for Senator Coburn's arrival.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is certainly fine.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, you can now announce morning business.</paragraph>
