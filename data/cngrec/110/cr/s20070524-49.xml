    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 23, the residents of Pisek will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pisek, a railroad town located in Walsh County, was established in 1882 by Frank P. Rumreich and other Czech and Moravian settlers. Pisek was chosen as the name because some its the settlers had come from Pisek, Czechoslovakia, and also because the community was built near a sand ridge. Pisek means "sand" in Czech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pisek is home to 96 residents and several small businesses. The local J-Mart draws customers throughout the area because it is known for having the best Christmas candy selection in the region. Pisek's church, the St. John Nepomucene Catholic Church, was blessed on the feast of St. John Nepomucene on May 16, 1887, and today it continues to be vital part of the community. The community's celebration will include a church service, a parade, a traditional Bohemian pork and dumpling meal, and various  afternoon activities. An evening street dance will close the celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Pisek, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Pisek and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Pisek that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
