    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the World Health Organization estimates that more than 1 billion people across the globe do not have access to clean, safe drinking water. The lack of clean water means that more than 4,000 children die every day because of the diseases they acquire due to unsafe water. These deaths are preventable, and I am proud to call attention to the work that the Procter &amp; Gamble Company, one of my constituents, is doing to prevent these deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>P&amp;G teamed with over 30 partners to provide safe drinking water to 40 countries and has provided safe drinking water during the global crises such as the tsunami in Asia, hurricanes in the Caribbean, and floods in the Philippines and Bangladesh. On Monday, former P&amp;G CEO John Pepper delivered the one billionth liter of safe drinking water at a rural clinic near Lagos, Nigeria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The billionth liter of safe drinking water was delivered through PUR Purifier of Water. PUR is a powdered water clarification and disinfectant that comes in small, easy-to-use packets. One packet has the same ingredients as a municipal water system to remove pollutants and cysts and kill bacteria and viruses in a liter of polluted water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud of what Procter &amp; Gamble does. Their philanthropy extends far beyond this. They are committed to doing this for another 5 years and creating two more billion liters of safe drinking water.</paragraph>
