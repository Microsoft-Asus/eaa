    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, like my colleagues, I too, rise in support of the full funding for the 100,000 community police officers. It has been a linchpin to a very successful anti-crime strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1990s, we pursued a single strategy of putting more cops on the beat and getting gangs, guns and drugs off the street. It led to the longest and largest decline of violent crime in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the elimination of the COPS program, community police officers, we saw a steady increase in violent crime. Cops doing community policing, an old strategy, door by door, knowing their neighbors, knowing their community, led to a dramatic drop in violent crime. Reducing those 100,000 extra police on the streets led to an increase in violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats came here to change Washington, to bring a new direction to our policy. Seeing an increase in violent crime in America, we went back to a basic fundamental strategy that has proven year after year to be successful, adding 100,000 cops, doing community policing, knowing their neighbors, knowing the kids that go to school, knowing where the problems are, hitting the problems before they start, leading to the most successful anti-violent crime strategy in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that we have brought this change to Washington.</paragraph>
