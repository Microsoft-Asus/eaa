    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wish to quote Jackson Browne's "Lives in the  Balance," a song written quite a few years ago but most appropriate for today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I've been waiting for something to happen</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a week or a month or a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the blood in the ink of the headlines</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the sound of the crowd in my ear</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You might ask what it takes to remember</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you know that you've seen it before</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where a government lies to a people</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And a country is drifting to war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"And there's a shadow on the faces</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the men who send the guns</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the wars that are fought in places</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where their business interests runs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"On the radio talk shows and the TV</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You hear one thing again and again</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How the U.S.A. stands for freedom</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we come to the aid of a friend</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But who are the ones that we call our friends,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These governments killing their own?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are lives in the balance</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are people under fire</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are children at the cannons</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there is blood on the wire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"There's a shadow on the faces</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the men who fan the flames</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the wars that are fought in places</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where we can't even say the names?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I want to know who the men in the shadows are</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to hear somebody asking them why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they're never the ones to fight or die.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there are lives in the balance</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are people under fire</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are children at the cannons</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there is blood on the wire."</paragraph>
