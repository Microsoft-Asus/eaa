  <narrative>RETIREMENT OF DON MITCHELL -- (Senate - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6934">S6934</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, you and I and all of our colleagues know that the Senate could not function without the superb work of the Senate staff. These dedicated men and women work day in and day out, often logging long hours, working under pressure, and performing extremely sensitive jobs, not for high pay, but because of their dedication to their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these individuals deserve our praise and our thanks. But occasionally one of them deserves to be singled out. Today I rise to pay tribute to one such individual, Mr. Don Mitchell, professional staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don is retiring soon after 24 years of government service, 22 of them here in the Senate. In 1984, the same year I was first elected to the Senate, Don began his career as a legislative assistant for national security in the office of his home State Senator, John Glenn. In 1989, Senator Glenn moved Don to the staff of the Intelligence Committee. His association with Senator Glenn and the committee lasted until 1999 when Don left to become Director of Intelligence Programs for the National Security  Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After spending 2 years at the National Security Council, the Intelligence Committee was lucky enough to lure Don back to the committee staff. And I have been fortunate that he has stayed throughout my tenure on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While on the committee, Don has worked on a wide range of issues. He has handled the budgets of the FBI, and the Departments of State, Energy and Treasury and he has been responsible for counter intelligence programs. In addition to Senator Glenn he provided liaison support to Senators Richard Bryan and DICK DURBIN. For the past few years he has overseen all covert action activities, the most sensitive programs within the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout this time, Don has done his job with a professionalism that has earned the respect of his colleagues and Members on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Don's professional accomplishments are impressive, they are far from the sum of who Don is. Don is an accomplished author, having published works on one of his political heroes, Adlai Stevenson, and most recent, a biography of his first boss, Senator Glenn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don's true passion though is his family. His wife Grace, his son Logan, and his daughter Ella know well of his devotion to them. They also know of his dedication to his work here in the Senate, having supported him for so many years and having endured the many late nights and weekends he has sacrificed for the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don is the type of staffer who does not seek glory or recognition for himself. He does not look for ways to insert himself into issues in order to be noticed. He knows what is important and he works toward that goal. He shuns the limelight, but he has made deep and lasting contributions to the process of intelligence oversight. His steady presence, his solid advice, and his devastating wit will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish him well in his coming endeavors and hope that our paths cross again.</paragraph>
