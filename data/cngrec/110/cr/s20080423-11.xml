    <paragraph>Madam President, it has taken a long time to get where we are now. I express my appreciation to Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi and others who worked very hard on this. We have said it before, but you can't say it enough: Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have different political philosophies, but there are no two Senators who work better together on the committee than they do. They always act as gentlemen. They work very hard. But for their good  work, we would not be where we are on this issue. I extend my appreciation to them and others who worked hard, but especially those two fine Senators.</paragraph>
