  <narrative>SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF A NATIONAL TOURETTE SYNDROME DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6013]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to help raise awareness of Tourette syndrome. This is a misunderstood disorder that affects an unknown number of Americans. The experts think that maybe 200,000 of us suffer from this neurological disorder; although no one really knows because it is often misdiagnosed. That is why we need to increase awareness and applaud those who work on a daily basis to make this one of the issues that we must be aware of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State, the New Jersey Center for Tourette Syndrome and Associated Disorders provides an innovative, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional approach to the treatment for those in New Jersey who have the Tourette syndrome and for their families. It is the first and only program of its kind in the Nation, and it serves as a model for other centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In concert with the State legislature, they declared every Wednesday in New Jersey as Tourette Syndrome Day to call attention to this disorder. In order to continue to bring awareness to this disorder, today, I will introduce a resolution supporting the designation of a National Tourette Syndrome Day.</paragraph>
