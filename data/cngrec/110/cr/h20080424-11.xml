    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this coming Monday, April 28, millions of people worldwide will recognize Workers Memorial Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, in this country, thousands of workers are killed due to workplace related injuries, and tens of thousands more die of occupational illness. It is staggering to think that each day an average of 16 workers are killed due to the injuries on the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that everyone deserves a safe and healthy workplace. Many of us take this basic right for granted, but for millions of Americans, the threat of being permanently disabled or even killed on a job is very real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Workers Memorial Day not only recognizes and honors those who have been killed or injured on the job, it also reminds us of the overwhelming need to improve health and safety standards in our Nation's workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a resolution to recognize Workers Memorial Day, and I certainly encourage all my colleagues on Monday to pay respect for those who have lost their lives this past year.</paragraph>
