  <chair>The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Cloture Motion</chair>
  <chair>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending Hatch amendment No. 3047 relating to hate crimes to Calendar No. 189, <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment that I have filed to <bill type="h" number="1545">H.R. 1545</bill>, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. My amendment expresses the sense of Congress that an appropriate site be established within the Arlington National Cemetery for a small memorial to the memory of the 40 members of the U.S. Armed Forces who perished in an airplane crash at Bakers Creek, Australia, on June 14, 1943. A similar provision is already included in the House version of  the fiscal year 2008 DOD authorization bill, and so it is important for the Senate to declare its support for this worthy cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 14, 1943, a B-17C Flying Fortress aircraft was transporting a group of U.S. servicemen from the city of Mackay in Queensland, Australia. The 35 servicemen, accompanied by six crew members, were returning to the jungle battlefields of New Guinea to continue their brave fight against the enemy Japanese forces. They had spent approximately 10 days in Mackay enjoying a much needed break at American Red Cross rest and recreation facilities, whose location in Australia was not widely known  at the time. The aircraft lifted off into a fog and, 5 minutes after takeoff, crashed 5 miles south at Bakers Creek, killing everyone on board except for a sole survivor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To this day, the cause of the crash remains a mystery. History books, to a certain extent, have obscured this event even though it remains the deadliest plane crash in Australian history. There is a reason for that. The press was not allowed to report the crash when it occurred--owing to wartime censorship laws. The relatives of those who perished received telegrams from the U.S. War Department only stating that their loved ones had been killed somewhere in the South West Pacific. Secrecy shrouded  this plane crash because the U.S. military was not eager to either tip off nearby Japanese forces on the presence of U.S. troops in Australia or feed enemy propaganda. For that reason, this plane crash that has proved to be the worst single airplane crash in the South West Pacific theater during World War II--remained an official secret for 15 years after the end of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment before the Senate today would seek to provide a lasting tribute to the bravery and dedication of these young American men. It would establish the sense of the Congress that a permanent memorial, modest in size and nature, should be located at an appropriate place in Arlington National Cemetery. For too long, the truth on how these young men died in the service of their Nation has been hidden away--albeit for understandable reasons. Next June 14, 2008 will mark the 65th anniversary  of the forgotten tragedy. Now is the time to mark their sacrifices with the proper level of respect and reverence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The memorial to honor the lives and sacrifice of these 40 American heroes has already been constructed, yet it lies on foreign soil. The memorial, built by Codori Memorials of Gettysburg, PA, today stands on the grounds of the Australian Embassy here in our Nation's Capital. It is a very small memorial--5 feet 2 inches high and 4 feet wide at the base, occupying only 5 1/2  square feet of land. We thank Ambassador Dennis Richardson and the Government of Australia for so graciously hosting this  memorial; we are reminded of the long-standing alliance between our two great nations. Yet it is time for the official memorial to  these American heroes to come home, to be welcomed at Arlington National Cemetery where it can take its rightful place among our fallen heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of the 40 Americans who perished in this crash is a true hero who gave their lives to the cause of our Nation. To date, the Bakers Creek Memorial Association has located the families of 38 of the 40 casualties. They continue to search for relatives of the remaining two soldiers to notify them of the specifics surrounding their loved one's deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to claim prerogative on behalf of my home State to take note of the six Pennsylvanians killed in this tragic crash. Each of their families still resides in Pennsylvania. Their names and hometowns are as follows: PFC James E. Finney, Erie, PA; TSGT Alfred H. Frezza, Altoona, PA; SGT Donald B. Kyper, Hesston, PA; PFC Frank S. Penksa, Moscow, PA; PFC Anthony Rudnick, Haddon Heights, PA; CPL Raymond H. Smith, Oil City, PA</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am joined in this effort by Senator Specter. It is time to do right by these forgotten American heroes and give them and their families a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery that is worthy of their valor, worthy of their honor.</paragraph>
