  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my staff members and I hear from Mississippians every day about the crippling effects of high energy prices. We all understand the need for increasing clean energy supplies, and I hope we can continue to work to do that and to develop other innovative solutions to deal more effectively with this great problem. But the bill we are considering will not accomplish that goal. Instead, the legislation will have a detrimental effect on our economy. It will contribute to  a higher overall cost of living, and it will be especially harmful to lower income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to projections by the Energy Information Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, energy costs are projected to rise because of this legislation. Energy prices are already at an all-time high. We cannot afford to increase these costs even further. By 2030, increased costs for delivered coal could range between 405 percent and 804 percent, natural gas prices could rise between 34 percent and 107 percent, and gasoline prices could go up between 17 percent and 41 percent.  Although the substitute amendment we are considering imposes yearly cost ceilings, these high prices will still be realized unless improbable advancements in alternative energy production, such as 70 new nuclear reactors and 68 billion gallons of ethanol, are produced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Various projections of this bill show not only will prices increase, Americans could lose jobs as industries struggle to keep costs down. I am proud of the new era of manufacturing that my State of Mississippi is entering, but I don't want Mississippians to lose the jobs we have fought so hard to obtain. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Information Administration suggest that this bill could reduce the gross domestic product of the United States by as much as 7 percent by 2050  and could reduce the manufacturing output of the United States by almost 10 percent in 2030. A reduction in output means that industry will need fewer workers in order to keep their costs down. A need for fewer workers will result in job losses, and unemployment rates in my State are already too high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the Senate should spend time considering the best use of America's natural resources while being mindful of the environment. However, if we are going to mandate reductions in greenhouse gases, there are certain principles we need to keep in mind. The Senate must consider the costs we will impose on the consumers we represent. The legislation we have before us goes beyond what is required to reduce emissions and imposes harsh, costly restrictions on the industries and businesses we count  on to keep our economy healthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides that only 30 percent of annual emissions reduction obligations can be met using credits and offsets. Only half of that amount can be from domestically generated credits, through a complex formula, and the remainder of the available credits would come from outside the United States. Many of these credits and offsets will likely come from the agricultural sector. Mississippi farmers are already engaged in better and more efficient practices, such as no-till farming, new irrigation  efficiencies, and reforestation of marginal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another troubling aspect of the legislation is the creation of a massive new mandatory spending regime that would direct nearly $3.3 trillion in auction revenues over the next several decades to dozens of specific programs, some that already exist but some that are new. These mandatory programs will not likely receive the proper oversight and control that the annual appropriations process provides. It is unreasonable to think we can know today whether it will be appropriate in 2050 to allocate  3.42 percent of auction revenues for Department of the Interior adaptation activities or to allocate 3.1 percent of auction revenues in 2030 for cellulosic biomass programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, where we have annual hearings and review the needs and the constraints we are dealing with under the budget for appropriating funds, I cannot support this approach that pretends to project what the appropriated amount should be years and years from now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope we will be able to help restore a strong economy, create an energy infrastructure that provides for low-cost electrical and motor fuel prices, and foster a responsible attitude about our natural resources and the environment. However, the legislation we are now considering will not bring Americans lower energy costs or, realistically, a cleaner environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless major changes to this legislation are considered, I cannot support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I could give these remarks now or I could have given them when we were on the bill because they address something that is disturbing a number of Senators. That concern is that the majority leader may be thinking of filling the tree, which means he is not going to allow us to offer a significant number of amendments to this bill. That is, from what I can tell, something that we should not do, and he should not do. As someone who knows him well and works with him well,  I think it would be a mistake to fill the tree on a bill like this, and let me give a few examples from my own experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we used to do business the way the Senate does business, not filling trees but filling many days with legislation of importance, we had a Clean Air Act, Mr. President. The manager of the bill was Ed Muskie. The Clean Air Act; Ed Muskie. The first bill of that sort that came to the floor. I was a brand new Senator. I was on the committee. Very interesting. I spent a great deal of time on the Senate floor just listening and watching. That bill was on the floor of the Senate 5 weeks--5 weeks  not 5 days--with 168 amendments considered and 162 acted upon. Of those, 60 were Democratic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, imagine this bill before us, which is far more important in terms of the ramifications to the American economy, to the costs that will be added to energy, to the trial run that we are taking upon ourselves to try to curtail carbon, which we don't even know will work, yet it will put into the marketplace trillions of new dollars that are allocations. There are certificates, not issued by the Treasury of the United States but, rather, issued under the mandate of this program. All of the language  in this bill as to who gets those allocations, as though we walked around and walked the streets and tried to see who might need them and  who might support the bill and provide these allocations, that deserves as much time as the Senate wants to spend offering amendments. It is probably the biggest, most complicated bill we have had, certainly in the 36 years that I have been a Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we tried an energy bill. We finally passed it after the third try, but we didn't try to fill the tree. That is language for saying we are making it so that it can't be amended, so that it will move rapidly because all avenues for amendment are filled, and thus the tree is filled. That is where the language comes from. The leader has the authority to do it, or whoever can be recognized ahead of him, if they want to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will cite another example. We finally passed a very good comprehensive energy act 3 years ago. That bill was on the floor of the Senate for 3 weeks--3 weeks not 3 days. This bill that we are talking about has been on the Senate floor only 3 days, 4 days, and already we are considering closing off debate. I have been here 35 years, and I have never seen anything like this--thinking of filling the tree on a bill of this magnitude, this complexity, and, I might say, with the certainty of having  mistakes. It is just as certain as we are standing here and you are sitting there presiding that this bill has to have many errors in it, many things we will regret passing if we don't amend it, talk about it, and analyze it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, and having examples of precedent here, when we behave like a Senate, where we were not unwilling to take 100 amendments on a bill when you considered that, and you didn't say: Oh, the Senate is closing its doors, we are dead, we used to say: We are live. We are going to get it done. Senator Muskie made his name on that one bill because it was here 5 weeks. Nobody ever questioned his capacity, after that, to handle legislation. I use that as an example when I tell people how  do you become a Senator. You have an opportunity to come to the floor to manage something for anywhere from 3 days to 3 or 4 weeks. I had that chance three times on budgets. Before anybody ever knew me, I had the opportunity to come down here and do that. People found out I could manage a bill. That is part of the Senate. That happened to Senator Muskie--5 solid weeks and 100 amendments to get a Clean Air Act through here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is bigger, more important, more comprehensive, and maybe more difficult for the American economy and American people than the Clean Air Act. It needs time, not tree building, not trunk building, not closing off opportunities to amend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
