  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the other body yesterday, under the leadership of Senator Reid, the gentleman from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, had a resolution supporting the funding of our troops, and the Senate leadership prevented that resolution from being brought to the floor under regular order because they wanted first to bring a resolution condemning the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the Speaker of the House has announced that next week we will have a resolution brought to the floor of this body condemning the President's plan for a new way forward in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I challenge the Speaker and the Democratic leadership, if that resolution is on this floor, to bring forward also the resolution of a true war hero, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, supporting the continued funding of the troops in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard Members on the other side of the aisle continue to say we can and will, if necessary, cut off funding. This will give them an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is.</paragraph>
