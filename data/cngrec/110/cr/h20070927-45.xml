  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11008]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the representative of the majority leader, the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), for the purpose of inquiring about next week's schedule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of these bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour business and 10 a.m. for legislative business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Friday there will be no votes in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We expect to consider <bill type="h" number="2470">H.R. 2470</bill>, legislation dealing with contractors who commit crimes overseas; <bill type="h" number="928">H.R. 928</bill>, the Improving Government Accountability Act; and a bill to provide tax relief for mortgage debt forgiveness in the event of foreclosures.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank you for that information. It does look like to me that the schedule for next week is incredibly light for 3 days of work. Last week, when Mr. Hoyer and I were talking about the problems of bringing the SCHIP bill to the floor without a conference, without any real opportunity for those of us on this side to see the bill, he said last week one of the reasons for that was the Senate was not able to go to conference. And I'm hoping on the four bills that the Senate has  already passed, and we could go to conference on, that we see some action on those bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, particularly, the bill where the new benefits for military families and veterans that could be available as early as next Tuesday, October 1, aren't going to be available because we're not naming conferees. And I wonder if my friend has any sense of when we might be able to have one of those bills, or any appropriation bill, on the House floor now that the fiscal year is essentially, this is the last legislative working day in the fiscal year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four bills have been ready, one of them, the military quality of life and veterans bill, for some time now, with no apparent interest in going to conference and getting that bill done. And I know we notified the majority before that I'd be asking that question, and so I'm wondering if you have any sense of when any or all of those bills might actually be scheduled, particularly looking at the incredibly light workweek scheduled for next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much. I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman will note that we did a lot of incredibly good work this week, passing the SCHIP bill, the Children's Health Insurance bill, passing the flood insurance bill off the floor this afternoon, passing the CR just yesterday. So there has been an incredible amount of good work done this week. And as far as the bills that you referenced, we will be planning to conference with the Senate as soon as they signify that they are ready to do that, and will be working diligently with them to bring  those bills to the floor when the conference is complete and ready.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I could reclaim my time here, I'd just point out that the Senate actually has requested not only a conference, but named conferees on all four of those bills. And I'd yield to you for anything you want to say about that. I mean, they're ready to go to conference, and I'm just asking why we're not so we can get some of this work done. And I'd yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>I'd be happy to answer the gentleman's question. We are reviewing all of those bills and want to make sure that, obviously, the House is on equal footing with the Senate. And when we are ready to go to conference, we will certainly join them and make sure those bills are brought to the floor in as timely a fashion as possible.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, before we go to one other topic, I'd just say that for bills where we could have started, particularly for military families, the quality of life issues there and for veterans, I think it's a shame that we're not starting those on Tuesday, when they could have started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing that just happened, the President just sent the Peru Free Trade Agreement to the House. The Ways and Means Committee held its markup on the Peru Free Trade Agreement this week, and I've read, at least, that there's an intention, before we go to that trade agreement, to go to a trade adjustment bill that has not yet been written. That trade adjustment bill, when it has passed in the past, has passed with trade promotion authority. With no new trade promotion authority, there's  less reason than there might have otherwise been for new trade adjustment authority. And more importantly, it seems, we might run the risk here of slowing the Peru agreement, the clock of which just started, if we wait for a bill that's not yet been written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I guess my two questions would be, do we plan to do trade adjustment assistance with TPA? And does the gentlelady have any sense of why it's necessary to do that before we do a trade agreement that we've already held the markup on and the President just sent down?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I'd yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Thank you. As far as the gentleman's reference to the military quality of life bill at the beginning of your remarks, I will remind the gentleman that we did pass, in the military health care and veterans bill, the largest single increase in health care in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. So we are certainly doing everything we can to expand access to health care and improve the quality of life of our military veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Referring to the gentleman's question about the trade adjustment act and Peru, I'll remind the gentleman that the Ways and Means Committee did conduct a markup this very week. We are fully engaged in working on the Peru trade agreement and will be working on the trade adjustment act simultaneously to the free trade agreement with Peru.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd just say that, one, as we have started that clock, I think it's very important that we keep on schedule, particularly since this will be really the first bill that the majority has done under the TPA standards, and we want to work closely with the majority on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I'd also point out that it's obvious we have not done everything we could have done for military families and veterans, or we'd have a bill that goes into effect next Tuesday instead of some time later this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back.</paragraph>
