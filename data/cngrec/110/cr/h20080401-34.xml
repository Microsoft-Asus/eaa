    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have now entered the sixth year of the war in Iraq, a war the Bush administration assured us would be short and easy. One Bush official famously remarked that the victory in Iraq would be a "cakewalk." Sadly, it has been the opposite for our troops, who continue to face lengthy and multiple deployments in the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, as we mourned the marking of a grim milestone, the death of 4,000 American troops in Iraq, we were reminded of the human costs of this ill-advised war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military leaders warned that the war is putting enormous stress on our troops. We have seen a dramatic increase in suicides and depression. Lieutenant General William Caldwell, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, said the Army is experiencing a shortage of majors and captains, because many who have had one, two and three combat tours have made the decision to go back into civilian life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With 4,000 American lives lost and thousands of young men and women suffering serious injuries, we should be looking at a way to end the war in Iraq. Instead, the Bush administration continues to support the status quo. "100 years" is one presidential candidate's latest statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must end the war.</paragraph>
