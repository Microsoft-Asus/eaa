    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to recognize a tremendously innovative small business from my home State of Maine that recently opened an upgraded production facility to benefit both its employees and its business operations. Immucell, an emerging biotechnology company based in Portland, opened its newly expanded building on June 7 to great fanfare. The new facility benefits Immucell's 30 employees, who now have enhanced space and equipment with which to conduct research and manufacture  products. Equally as critical, the facility was designed to help Immucell more easily comply with current good manufacturing practice standards. Enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, current good manufacturing practice requirements assure quality in our food and medicines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immucell's specialized work is quite impressive. In a rapidly expanding biotech industry, Immucell has carved out a niche as a leading producer of medicines for animals in the dairy industry. The company's products, such as First Defense and Mast-Out, have ensured the safety and health of cows and calves that supply our milk and other dairy products. Working together with Pfizer, Immucell has managed to turn Mast-Out into a profitable product. Besides its products, Immucell's research provides  the company a respected and prestigious role in the animal-health industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was delighted to hear that Immucell is seeking to use its expanded facilities to extend its reach into overseas markets. What a great honor that would be for the State of Maine. Immucell contributes immensely to Maine's small business community, and the ever-increasing relevance of its work also places it at the forefront of modern science worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immucell's efforts to become a leader in its market are noteworthy, and the vision that its leadership has for future growth reflects a steadfast determination for continued success. It is particularly exciting that a Maine small business is making such a name for itself in an industry replete with large companies. Immucell and its high-paying jobs provide us with a shining example of smart growth. I commend chief executive officer Michael Brigham and all the employees at Immucell for their wise  choices and tremendous achievements, and I wish them much success in the future.</paragraph>
