  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to call to the attention of all of the Members that our new Clerk of the House is continuing to make impressions. She is on the cover of Crisis magazine for this month, the official publication of the NAACP. And she is president of the local chapter. I just thought that if you don't have a copy, she is standing right over there.</paragraph>
