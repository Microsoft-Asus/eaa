    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at a time when there are serious problems in our health care system, the Children's Health Insurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP, has a proven track record. Over the last decade, as the number of uninsured Americans has increased, the number of children living without health insurance has actually decreased, and thanks to the CHIP program, we have experienced a 60-percent drop in the number of uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the House plans to reauthorize the CHIP program. Congress must act on this legislation now. In the past, CHIP has received strong bipartisan support. However, in an about-face, the President and some Republicans have abandoned their support of CHIP on supposed philosophical grounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress refuses to act this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that nearly 1 million children will lose their health coverage. Democrats are simply not to get that to happen. We are going to pass the CHIP reauthorization today so that 11 million children have access to the health insurance they need to live healthy lives.</paragraph>
