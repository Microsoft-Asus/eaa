    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Conrad and the other members of the Budget Committee for their kind words and  well wishes that have been directed toward me during our work on this the final budget resolution during my tenure in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As most of you know, I have worked on many budgets and numerous other initiatives during my 36 year career. However, important work still remains for the Budget Committee. If I had more time I would without a doubt seek to address entitlement spending. I had pledged to work with Chairman Conrad on his bipartisan bill and I am disappointed that we may not have time to take it up this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget, like many before it, fails to address the 800 pound gorilla in the room, otherwise known as entitlement spending. After 2010, spending related to the aging of the baby-boom generation will begin to raise the growth rate of total outlays. The annual growth rate of Social Security spending is expected to increase from about 4.5 percent this year to 6.5 percent by 2017. In addition, because the cost of health care is likely to continue rising rapidly, spending for Medicare and Medicaid  is projected to grow even faster--in the range of 7 or 8 percent annually. Total outlays for Medicare and Medicaid are projected to more than double by 2017, increasing by 124 percent, while nominal GDP is projected to grow only 63 percent. The budget currently under consideration does not offer solutions, much less even address, entitlement spending or reform. I do not support this budget in its current form because it does not offer any meaningful solution for entitlement spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer this piece of advice to my colleagues serving on the Budget Committee: tackle entitlement spending. The Budget Committee should propel itself to the forefront of this debate and use the tools that only this committee has at its disposal to address the number one issue on the minds of the American public. With true leadership, this committee has the potential to turn mere Senators into heroes if they choose to address the entitlement programs. I urge Senators to come together and find  a solution in the near future before it is too late to resolve this crisis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased an agreement has been reached on a budget resolution conference report. It is the duty of Congress to approve the Nation's fiscal blueprint, and this year's budget report presents a responsible plan that rightfully prioritizes job creation and programs to support the safety, health, and education of America's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our economy has long been suffering and is in need of a boost. This budget will help start to undo the damage caused by the administration's misguided fiscal policies and stave off additional cuts proposed by the administration that would affect important programs that are especially needed in this time of economic distress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget rejects the President's failed policy of paying for tax cuts by adding to the debt burden of our children and grandchildren. The fiscal year 2009 budget that President Bush sent to Congress in February would have us pursue the same failed priorities and policies that have proven so woefully wrong for Michigan and for our Nation. The President's proposal would dig us even deeper into the massive deficit ditch we are already facing. The President's proposal would provide even more tax  cuts to the wealthiest among us, while at the same time it would cut funding for critical programs important to my State's economy and the well-being of the State of Michigan. This includes cuts to, among other things, health care funding, including Medicare and Medicaid; decreased</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to break from those failed policies by forgoing irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthiest among us and making important investments in America's future; we must work to put our country back on track and begin the long process of climbing out of this deficit ditch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am glad this resolution provides for a balanced budget by 2012. It also furthers our strong pay-go rules, which require that all mandatory spending and revenue provisions be deficit-neutral. It sets the course to fully offset a repair of the alternative minimum tax, which would otherwise cause nearly 20 million middle class taxpayers to be subject to a tax they were never intended to be subjected to. It also assumes middle income tax relief, including marriage penalty relief, the  child tax credit, and the persistence of the 10 percent bracket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this resolution includes my proposal to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to promote American manufacturing. Congress needs to act to revitalize our domestic manufacturing sector. The administration has stood by passively while 3 million manufacturing jobs were lost to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution also seeks to close the tax loopholes costing the Treasury large amounts of revenue and which have shifted an unfair burden to middle income taxpayers. Shutting down abusive tax shelters and offshore tax havens are two of the major tax gap initiatives assumed in the budget resolution. Additionally, this budget would reject many of the cuts in funding proposed by the President for essential health care and education programs. I believe this budget resolution, while only a blueprint  for future action, sets us on a course of fiscal responsibility and paves the way for important investments in America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that this conference report retains an amendment I co-authored which, taken together with the underlying clean energy reserve fund, will support extension of the current production tax credits for renewable electricity and biodiesel fuel, the small-producer biodiesel tax credit, and clean renewable energy bond authority. It also proposes new tax credits for cellulosic ethanol and plug-in hybrid vehicles. I will continue to work to enact these necessary incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major bipartisan efforts will be needed to make true progress on the long-term fiscal problems we face. But this resolution represents a good start by proposing an end to the financing of unaffordable tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, as well as funding prudent investments to promote the health and well-being of our children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution conference report. As a member of the committee, I want to recognize Chairman Conrad and thank him personally for his untiring efforts to craft a blueprint that will get our Nation's fiscal house back in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps more than at any time in our history, it is imperative that Congress focus seriously on our Nation's budget situation. The competing demands of an aging population, our current international commitments, growing competition in the global economy, our widening trade deficit, and shrinking revenues all require that we address our fiscal situation with urgency. Revenues are at a historic low point, while the demographics of the country are driving spending higher on needs that the private  sector is ill-equipped to address. Now there is widespread consensus among working families that--regardless of the official definition--we are in a recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Employment growth during this administration has averaged fewer than 50,000 jobs a month--the lowest monthly rate for any administration since Dwight D. Eisenhower's and less than one-quarter the average of 237,000 jobs per month created during the Clinton administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inflation-adjusted hourly wages have decreased by 1.3 percent since August 2003. Even median annual household income has decreased by $1,700, or 3.6 percent, after accounting for inflation. These are aggregate statistics, but behind each of them are millions of families who are falling behind as a result of inadequate investment in the right priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, we have been moving in the wrong direction. Over the past 7 years, the Bush administration has sent us budgets with the wrong priorities. They have contained drastic cuts to education and health care programs. They did not provide for investment in our nation's public transit systems, bridges, and roads. They did not address energy efficiency. They ignored veterans' health care needs and actually attempted to make it more difficult for veterans to access the health  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="5010">S5010</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This conference agreement targets tax relief where it is most needed--at working families. This includes an extension of the child care tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10 percent individual income tax bracket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally important, this budget resolution is fiscally responsible. It will return us to a balanced budget, with a surplus of $22 billion in 2012 and $10 billion in 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even as crucial domestic programs have suffered under this administration, the Nation's debt has increased from $5.8 trillion at the end of President Bush's first year in office to in excess of $9 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we fail to change course, we will leave our children and grandchildren an insurmountable legacy of debt. The fiscal policies of this current administration have erased the $5.6 trillion surplus that was projected in 2000 and replaced it with a projected deficit of nearly $4 trillion over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The borrowing necessitated by deficit spending has jeopardized our economic position in the world, and it has clouded the outlook for generations of Americans to come. We have had to turn to foreign governments to borrow money. Our foreign-held debt has increased by more than 100 percent during this administration. In fact, in just one year, the total has increased from $2.1 trillion to $2.5 trillion. According to the Treasury Department, as of March 2008, the United States now owes more than</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why it is so important that we make the difficult budget choices that can return us to a balanced budget, and that this resolution contain tools needed to get there, including pay-go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution calls for $3.1 trillion in spending for the next fiscal year. It rejects the President's cuts to entitlement programs, and it funds domestic discretionary programs at $21 billion above his budget request. This means that we can begin to make much needed improvements in the programs that help build our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The many important areas that this budget addresses are particularly crucial in these difficult economic times for America's families. We provide for a reserve fund that will improve access to affordable housing for working families, we add $40 million for emergency food assistance and we improve unemployment compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In health care, I want to mention two specific areas. This budget makes room for critically needed increases in health research funding. The National Institutes of Health is headquartered in Maryland, and its grants fund research in my state and across the nation. Unfortunately, this is the sixth year in a row that NIH has been essentially flat-funded. I have the privilege of meeting often with biomedical researchers from my home state. They are working to find treatments and cures for our most  challenging diseases--cancer, diabetes, arthritis, ALS, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the period when Congress doubled NIH funding--between 1998 and 2003--researchers' chances of securing NIH funding for a worthwhile grant proposal was one in four. Since 2003, their chances have dwindled to one in eleven. Undergraduate and graduate students alike are beginning to question their career choices and wonder if there is a future for them in biomedical research. With medical research inflation at nearly 3.5 percent, we must increase the agency's funding by at least that amount  in order to break even. To make progress in the fight against disease, we must increase our spending substantially. I am pleased that our resolution rejects the President's planned cuts for this critical agency and makes room for additional funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget resolution also makes room for improvements to pediatric dental care. I have come to the floor of the Senate on several occasions to talk about a 12-year-old named Deamonte Driver. He lived just 6 miles from here in Prince George's County, MD. The Driver family, like many other families across the country, lacked dental coverage. At one point, his family had Medicaid, but they lost it when they moved into a shelter, and their paperwork fell through the cracks. When advocates for the  family tried to help, it took more than 20 calls just to find a dentist who would treat him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deamonte began to complain of headaches in January 2007. An evaluation at Children's Hospital found that he had an abscessed tooth, but the condition was advanced and he needed emergency brain surgery. He later experienced seizures and a second operation. Even though he received additional treatment and appeared to be recovering, medical intervention had come too late. Deamonte passed away on Sunday, February 25, 2007. At the end, the total cost of his treatment exceeded a quarter of a million  dollars--more than 3,000 times the $80 it would have cost for a tooth extraction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no excuse for us, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, to watch a child die for lack of access to basic dental care. It is difficult to find dentists to treat low-income children for two reasons. First, because there is a shortage of pediatric dentists--only 4.3 percent of dental school graduates in 2001 reported pediatric dentistry as their specialty of choice; and second, because the reimbursement from public programs such as Medicaid and SCHIP is low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our budget rejects the President's cuts to dental training programs, and it is my hope that we will continue to work to increase the number of pediatric dentists and improve reimbursement for public programs. But there are thousands more children, like Deamonte's brothers who also need dental care--who cannot wait for us to recruit and train more dentists. I thank both Senator Whitehouse, who joined me in offering an amendment in committee to address this issue, and the members of the  Budget Committee who unanimously supported it. My amendment would establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund in the budget for legislation to improve access for low-income children who are in either Medicaid, SCHIP, or are uninsured. As a result, this budget will allow Congress to fund legislation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget also funds critical investments in homeland security. The President's budget reduced funding for important first responder programs, including the SAFER--Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response--grant program. The SAFER grant program directly funds fire departments and volunteer firefighter interest organizations to help them increase the number of trained, frontline firefighters. This budget rejects those cuts and will give firefighters needed resources to protect our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that this resolution also addresses another issue that is critically important for Maryland. It calls for pay parity between civilian and military employees. With tens of thousands of Federal employees in Maryland, I have witnessed the additional burdens placed on our civil servants, particularly since the 2001 terrorist attacks on our Nation. These dedicated employees are called upon to assume greater risks with lower comparable pay to private sector wages. In addition, many Federal  agencies now face a human capital crisis, with thousands of our most experienced employees eligible to retire in the next few years. Pay parity is necessary if we will be able to recruit and retain a quality Federal workforce, and this budget provides for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I also note that this budget supports our veterans. We rightly reject the President's misguided proposals to increase enrollment fees and copayments for veterans' health care services. We increase funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs so that we can improve VA health care facilities and improve access to rehabilitation, mental health services, traumatic brain injury services, and speed the processing time for disability claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Chairman Conrad for his leadership in helping to bring forth this agreement. As he has said previously, it truly marks a new path forward for our country. I urged my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
