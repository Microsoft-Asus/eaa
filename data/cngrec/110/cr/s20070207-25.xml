    <paragraph>Madam President, I join my colleagues in saluting Richard H. Shapiro, the executive director of the Congressional Management Foundation. As Rick moves on to new challenges, I want to thank him for his remarkable service to the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Shapiro is responsible for bringing 21st century management skills to an institution build on 18th century rules and practices. We still have spittoons in the Senate--yet we also have blackberries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Shapiro helped us wrestle with issues that our Founding Fathers didn't even dream about. How do you answer thousands of e-mails a week? How do you hire, train, and retain excellent staff? How do you set goals and measure progress--so that promises made can be promises kept? How do you ensure that state and Washington offices communicate, coordinate and cooperate? Whenever I had a question about managing my office, I turned to Rick Shapiro--and my staff did the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Rick Shapiro's leadership, the Congressional Management Foundation has helped Members to set up their offices, upgrade office systems, and adjust to new ways of connecting with constituents. His book "Setting Course" is a must-read for all new Members of Congress. He was the first to compile and analyze information from individual offices--to enable Senators to learn from the best practices of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Shapiro is a part of our Senate family. In fact, he met his wife Trudy Vincent when she was my legislative director. Their daughter Abby has been spotted selling Girl Scout cookies around the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick Shapiro has made a lasting impact on the U.S. Senate. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for his service. While he is stepping down from the Congressional Management Foundation, I look forward to great things from Rick in the years ahead.</paragraph>
