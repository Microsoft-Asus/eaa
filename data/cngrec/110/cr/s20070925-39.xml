  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue we have debated for many months on the floor of the Senate. It has been debated in the other body, and it has been debated a lot of places across the country. The issue is children's health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a vehicle in place to make sure that not only do the 6.5 million children who are covered already under the program maintain their coverage all across the country, but in particular with this legislation, this bipartisan legislation, the Senate bill, which a couple of weeks ago we saw got 68 votes--the Presiding Officer and others in this body know it is hard to get 68 votes on anything, especially something as significant as children's health insurance. But that was a resounding vote  in favor of a policy which will make sure we cover those 6.5 million children but add substantially to that to the point where this legislation would allow us to make sure 10 million American children have health insurance. We have a vehicle. We have a program that works. We have bipartisan consensus from across the board,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is only one problem. Despite the bipartisan consensus which exists here and in the other body, the President has threatened and seems determined to veto this legislation. For the life of me, I can't understand that. I can't understand why the President would say that he supports reauthorizing the program, that he thinks the program is good and it works, but he will not support a bipartisan consensus. This makes no sense, especially since States across America have had this kind of insurance  in place for many years. In Pennsylvania, we have about 160,000 children covered right now, maybe a little more. We could increase that substantially over the next 5 years to add another 140,000 or more. So instead of having 160,000 kids covered, we get 300,000 children in Pennsylvania covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know this doesn't end the discussion. We know there will still be children who won't be covered. Even if we get to that 10 million number, we know there will be millions of children, maybe as many as 5 million, who are not covered. So we can't rest just on the foundation of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I plead with the President, don't veto legislation that will provide 10 million American children with the health care they should have, the health care their parents and their communities have a right to expect but also the health care for children in the dawn of their lives which, beyond what it does for that child, which is obvious, I think there is a strong moral argument, but even beyond that argument, what this will do for the American economy years into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These children, if they get the kind of health care and early learning we all support, will do better in school. They will achieve more. They will learn more. And if they learn more, they can earn more. We know there are CEOs across the country who understand this investment in our children is an investment in our economic future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join a lot of people in this Chamber in both parties who worked very hard to get 68 votes for this legislation. There was a lot of tough negotiating in the Senate Finance Committee, where the vote, I think, was 17 to 4 way back in the summer. There is the work that has been done in the House and the work that has been done between both bodies to get this right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask anyone who has an interest in this legislation across the country--or anywhere someone is following this issue--to urge the President not to veto children's health insurance that will cover 10 million American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
