  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="RECOGNITION OF MARINE CORPS LOGISTICS COMMAND MAINTENANCE CENTER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate the Marine Corps Logistics Command Maintenance Center at the Marine Corps Logistics Base in Albany, GA. The Maintenance Center Albany was the 2007 winner of the Robert T. Mason Depot Maintenance Award, and was also named Marine Logistics Unit of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This prestigious award, established in 2004, commemorates the former Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense for Maintenance Policy, Programs, and Resources, Robert T. Mason, a staunch supporter of excellence in organic depot maintenance operations throughout his three decades of Government service. In winning this award, the Maintenance Center Albany has exemplified responsive and effective depot level support to operating units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Maintenance Center Albany's Dedicated Design and Prototype Effort Team was singled out for its outstanding support to our men and  women in uniform through their hands-on innovation. I could not provide higher tribute than the Marine Corps itself when it described the Albany team as clearly demonstrating the ability to be responsive, resourceful, agile, and creative by designing and prototyping multiple systems in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the first time the tenant organization of Albany's Marine Corps Logistics Base has received this great honor. In 2005, the Maintenance Center was recognized for its Design and Manufacture Vehicle Armor Protective Kits Program which provided protective armor kits for U.S. Marine Corps combat vehicles, making the Marines a more effective fighting force and profoundly impacting both safety and morale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to individually recognize Christopher Tipper, a Maintenance Center Albany employee who was named Civilian Marine Logistician of the Year. Through his achievements Mr. Tipper brings great credit upon himself, MCLB Albany, and the U.S. Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national recognition of the achievements of the team and this individual is extremely well deserved. They comprise a dedicated workforce committed to meeting the needs of the warfighter. I am proud to pay tribute to these men and women and congratulate them and the leadership of the Maintenance Center Albany, as well as the entire Marine Corps Logistics Command on a job well done.</paragraph>
