  <narrative>MAKE THE R&amp;D TAX CREDIT PERMANENT -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H15419]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at the end of this month, a vitally important  research and development tax credit is due to expire again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1981, Congress has erratically extended this tax credit, and extensions have ranged from 6 years to 5 months. Sometimes extensions have applied retroactively. The tax credit even lapsed for a year. A permanent R&amp;D tax credit is long overdue, and Congress should act now to make a permanent R&amp;D tax credit a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress was right to offer an R&amp;D tax credit. Doing so boosted America's competitive edge in an increasingly cut-throat global marketplace of ideas, products, and services. Yet we ignore, to our economic peril, the fact that other countries, including Australia, Canada, China, France and India, also offer tremendous R&amp;D incentives to their industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time to make R&amp;D tax credits permanent. Doing so would remove an unnecessary burden on our industries, including roughly 35,000 Idahoans employed in high-tech jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is no reason for keeping this kind of tax credit temporary. Let us unleash the power of American ingenuity and make the R&amp;D tax credit permanent.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
