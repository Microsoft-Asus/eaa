  <narrative>THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007 -- (Senate - December 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15456">S15456</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator KENNEDY and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steven Domer, an Oklahoma City, OK, resident, went missing on October 26, 2007. The following day, police found his torched car and his body was found in a nearby ravine days later. On November 7, 2007, Darrell Madden was arrested for the shooting death of his friend Bradley Qualls. Both men were seen with the 62-year-old Domer the day of his disappearance and are believed to have been involved in his murder. Madden has been charged with murder for allegedly strangling Domer to death. Investigations  have uncovered that Madden was a sergeant in a White supremacist group and targeted Domer because he was gay. Domer's murder was allegedly a rite of passage for Qualls to rise to the next level within the organization. The district attorney prosecuting the case will present evidence to prove that Domer was targeted because he was gay. Oklahoma is one of seventeen States whose hate crime laws do not cover those targeted based on sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
