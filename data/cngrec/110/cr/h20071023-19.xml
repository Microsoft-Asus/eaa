    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week the rubber stamp Republicans in this House once again held true to their name by voting to stand with the President and reject health care coverage for 10 million American children. The spending priorities of the President's Republican allies in the House are simply out of line with the priorities of the American people. In fact, the 86 percent of Americans who support this bipartisan CHIP reauthorization might be interested to know that for the cost of just  37 days in Iraq, we could provide health care coverage to 10 million children. Yet the President's irresponsible, open-ended commitment to the occupation in Iraq continues, while the number of American children without access to health care keeps climbing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday the President asked Congress to borrow another $196 billion to continue his failed blank-check, no-plan policy in Iraq. But he and his Republican friends in  this body apparently feel that spending $35 billion on a highly successful program that provides health care to uninsured children is excessive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for Republicans to stop blindly following the President and start helping American families.</paragraph>
