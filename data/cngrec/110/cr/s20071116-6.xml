    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday was a day of real negativity by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The country could have benefitted  from passage of TRIA, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which is so important. We must do that before the end of the year or it will bring business to a real slowdown here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also were unable to get the modernization of FHA done, even though it passed the House overwhelmingly and came out of committee here by a vote of 20 to 1. It is a shame there was an objection to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And also AMT, Mr. President. We tried a number of different ways to get that done. It was objected to every time we tried to do something. That is unfortunate. We will continue to work on these things and maybe before the day is out, we will get that done.</paragraph>
