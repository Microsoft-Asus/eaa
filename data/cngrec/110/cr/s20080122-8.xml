  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14">S14</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we are going to move shortly to the Indian health bill. We have a little business we need to take care of prior to that. We are going to be in a period of morning business. We will add to that period of morning business whatever time the Republican leader used. When we get to morning business, the first 30 minutes will be under the control of the Republicans. The majority will control the 30 minutes that follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of <bill type="s" number="1200">S. 1200</bill>, the Indian health bill. There will be amendments offered today. We are not going to vote until 5:30. We hope to have a number of votes at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday, the Republicans will conduct a 1-day retreat or meeting. They are going to be at the Library of Congress. The Senate will be in session, and hopefully any amendments from the Democratic side will be offered and debated at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another issue which the Senate will be considering--and I will talk about that in a little bit--is the FISA legislation. That matter is going to expire on February 1.</paragraph>
