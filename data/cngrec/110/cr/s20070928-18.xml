  <narrative>PAT FARR RECOGNITION -- (Senate - September 28, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12333">S12333</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to recognize Pat Farr for his service as the executive director of FOOD for Lane County. A veteran of the Oregon State legislature, the Eugene City Council, and the Oregon Commission for Child Care, Mr. Farr has dedicated himself to bettering the lives of Oregonians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Farr accepted his position at FOOD for Lane County with three goals in mind: create financial stability, develop a strong staff, and restore the agency's public image. During Mr. Farr's tenure, all of these goals were accomplished. The agency has been lifted out of debt and into financial sustainability; a base of reserves has been created to increase long-term stability and improve donor confidence; and both the number of volunteers and the amount of distribution have been increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FOOD for Lane County is an important member of the community, providing food assistance to the many Lane County residents who are still unsure when their next meal will be. The  organization distributes more than 7 million pounds of food each year, enough for 22 emergency food pantries and more than 70 hunger relief centers. The agency also plays a critical role assisting our youth, as one out of three children in Lane County will eat from an emergency  food box or a subsidized meal program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Farr recently left FOOD for Lane County to work as a consultant for nonprofits. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. Farr for his distinguished work and unwavering commitment to serving his community.</paragraph>
