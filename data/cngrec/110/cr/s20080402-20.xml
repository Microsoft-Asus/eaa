  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize an extraordinary business from my home State of Maine, Johnny's Selected Seeds. A mail-order seed producer and seller from Kennebec County, Johnny's Selected Seeds recently garnered the U.S. Small Business Administration's Entrepreneurial Success Award. But what is most gratifying about the recognition for Johnny's is that the company won the award on the district, regional, and national levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Rob Johnston, Jr. founded Johnny's Selected Seeds in 1973 at the age of 22. With only $500 in his savings account, but with a deep appreciation for and knowledge of agriculture, Mr. Johnston began his venture in the attic of a farmhouse before finally settling in Albion, ME, in 1975. As Johnny's grew, so did demand for its product, largely due to the firm's easy-to-use and straightforward catalog with detailed descriptions of available seeds and handy growing information, as well as  the company's production of various vintage heirloom seeds. Johnny's moved its headquarters to Winslow, ME in 2002 and later opened a catalog store in the same town. The employee-owned company continues to maintain its property in Albion as a working farm and research facility while offering seed enthusiasts and curious visitors self-guided farm tours throughout the summer months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnny's employees take seriously their pledge to provide their customers with tools, seeds, plants, and supplies of the utmost quality. The company's minimum germination standards are well above those required by law, and Johnny's goes to great lengths to ensure that commercial varieties are free of certain viruses and diseases. Johnny's also offers various organic seeds, and since 1999, has adhered to the principles of the Safe Seed Pledge, signaling that the company does not ". . . knowingly  buy or sell genetically engineered seeds or plants." Additionally, in an effort to stay on the cutting edge, Johnny's takes great pride in the research it does to maintain its innovative reputation. In particular, the firm focuses on developing new seed varieties, as well as leading the way in quality control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnny's Selected Seeds has truly made a name for itself through its outstanding achievements and reliable service. But the company has also maintained a loyal customer base because of the basics. Johnny's vends a wide array of seeds, tools, and supplies to both home gardeners and small commercial growers. Offering a vast selection of vegetable seeds, from artichokes to watermelons, Johnny's also sells fruit seeds, herb seeds, and an impressive collection of flower seeds. Continually updating  its stock, Johnny's adds new seeds to its list each year, and 2008 is no exception. Some of the dozens of new products available range from colorful spring flowers to different corns, cantaloupes, and greens. And for convenience, home growers can order a small packet of 25 seeds, and larger growers can often request up to 10,000 or 25,000 seeds, depending on the product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A truly entrepreneurial business, Johnny's Selected Seeds constantly seeks new ways to grow, improve, and impress. It has, without a doubt, earned its latest accolades handily. To succeed as superlatively as Johnny's does speaks volumes about the resolve and passion of Mr. Johnston, but it is also a testament to the hard work and dedication of the company's over 80 full-time and 50 seasonal employees. I congratulate Johnny's Selected Seeds for earning the U.S. Small Business Administration's  Entrepreneurial Success Award at all levels and for the example it sets for small businesses everywhere.</paragraph>
