  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me add to the comments of my good friend, the majority leader. I think we would have a better chance of moving this bill along if we could do what we have done on every other Iraq debate we have had this year, which is to simply enter into an agreement for a series of votes. If we end up in the position of filing cloture on every amendment, it is going to be quite a lengthy process and considerably inconvenient to both sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope after the vote this morning, we will get back to the way we have dealt with these issues in the past, which is through concurrence and agreement. A series of votes, obviously, with a 60-vote threshold--this is the Senate; that is the way we have done it all year--would be fair to both sides and give both sides an opportunity to express themselves on the most important issue of our national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
