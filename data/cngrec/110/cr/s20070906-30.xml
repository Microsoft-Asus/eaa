  <narrative>MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007 -- (Senate - September 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11208">S11208</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the night of August 9, 2007, three friends with developmental disabilities were verbally assaulted by four teens as they left a Cheektowaga, NY, restaurant. Two of the friends, a 22-year-old local man and his 19-year-old girlfriend, got into their vehicle and began to drive away. The teens continued to taunt the couple with derogatory names for the developmentally disabled. The four youths drove after the couple in two cars, reportedly swerving repeatedly at the victims' car and nearly hitting  it. The disabled couple's car crashed as they tried to turn onto the Cheektowaga Thruway, causing significant damage to their vehicle. According to witnesses, the crash happened after the victim sped up to get away from the attackers' vehicles. The teens sped away, but thanks to witnesses and restaurant surveillance tapes, the police were able to apprehend the teens. Three of them were charged with perpetrating a hate crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
