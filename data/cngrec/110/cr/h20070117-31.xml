  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am urging my colleagues today to pass the College Student Relief Act. I speak not only as a Congresswoman from New Hampshire, but also as the mother of a college student and one about to enter college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These student loan interest rates are absolutely crippling students' ability to go to college and putting a burden on their families. These students are also deeply concerned now about what will happen when they go into the workforce and they have to pay a higher interest rate on their loans, as well as paying for higher energy costs and paying for rent and paying for all of the other expenses that young adults experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to please ease the pain on these students, encourage this higher education, because higher education is the key to prosperity in our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
