  <speaking speaker="400291" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last Saturday in Dublin, the national executive of Sinn Fein voted in favor of holding a special Ard Fheis on January 28 to vote on a motion supporting police and the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who remain committed to lasting peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland, bringing this peace process to a successful conclusion, it was a development that would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On both sides of the Irish Sea, the decision by Sinn Fein was welcomed as historic and important. The Taoiseach of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, called it a landmark and timely decision. The British Secretary of State for the North, Peter Hain, called it a hugely significant move of seismic proportions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as someone who has been involved in this process for three decades, I would describe the action by Sinn Fein as remarkable. It is a reflection of the leadership of Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. At a critical moment, they honored their commitments and once again kept their word. A vote taken by the executive last week is just the latest example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one should minimize the difficulties this decision is causing Sinn Fein leadership on the ground, but for nationalists and republicans the issue of policing has been a long and troubled history. I am confident that the special Ard Fheis will see it as a defining moment in Irish history and vote to support policing and the rule of law.</paragraph>
