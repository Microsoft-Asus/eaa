    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I rise again to address the impending crisis threatening Georgia's PeachCare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In just 4 days, no new children will be permitted to enroll. The program will have a $131 million shortfall, and neither the State of Georgia nor the Congress will have acted to save PeachCare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members of Congress, it is hard to imagine our children being uninsured, yet thousands of children in Georgia face that harsh reality every day. That is unacceptable. No child should be without health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress and the State of Georgia owe it to these children to ensure that the PeachCare program survives.</paragraph>
