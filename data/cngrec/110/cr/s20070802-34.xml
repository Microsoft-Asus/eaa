    <paragraph>Mr. President, genocide has only one morally tenable answer. This week, the United Nations found that answer: decisive and forceful action to protect the innocent. Tuesday's Security Council resolution put real teeth in the world's effort to stop the Darfur genocide: A paltry contingent of 7,000 African Union peacekeepers will swell with 26,000 more troops in a combined UN/AU force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The peacekeepers will take command of the region by the end of the year, and their arms will help to shield the people of Darfur from continued murder and rape and displacement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud this resolution. We all know that it comes 450,000 lives too late. But the UN's action looks positively instantaneous when set against the delay and the equivocation of our own Government. Special Envoy Andrew Natsios assured the world that American action was "imminent" 7 months ago. And it was 2 years ago that President Bush declared the crimes in Darfur "genocide."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is still time for America to act, and a vital role for America to play. The Security Council's force resolution, as valuable as it is, came at a price: To mollify China and several African member states, its provisions for multilateral sanctions on Sudan were significantly softened. We can, and must, fill the gap with unilateral sanctions of our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Multilateral force combined with American sanctions would show the international system working at its best. The world community has agreed to act against genocide; now, the United States can work in the spirit of that resolution and do its own part to bring the suffering to an end. Our economic muscle can be a potent weapon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three sanctions bills are before the Senate. Two <bill type="s" number="831">S. 831</bill>--the Sudan Divestment Authorization Act of 2007, and <bill type="s" number="1563">S. 1563</bill>, the Sudan Disclosure and Enforcement Act of 2007--have been authored by my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin. From the very start, his voice has been the strongest in the Senate on the Darfur genocide, and his tremendous leadership stands in stark contrast to this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A third sanctions bill--H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007--has been authored by Representative BARBARA LEE, whose leadership ranks with Senator Durbin's. I have asked the majority leader to expedite consideration of all of these bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to focus for a moment on Representative Lee's bill. It aims to punish the bloodstained Government of Sudan by assisting divestment from companies that--knowingly or not--have helped to fund the genocide. <bill type="h" number="180">H.R. 180</bill> requires the Department of the Treasury to develop a list of companies investing in specific sectors of the Sudanese economy: power production, mineral extraction, oil-related industries, and military equipment industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before being put on the list, companies are given 30 days to either rebut the designation or to say that they will be suspending such activities within a year. The bill also removes specific legal barriers to enable mutual fund and corporate pension fund managers to cut ties with these listed companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it allows States and localities to divest their public pension funds from those companies whose financial operations help support the genocidal practices of the Sudanese Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In ultimately leading to the withdrawal of funds from the Sudanese military machine, the bill does valuable work. But I am concerned that it entrusts the compilation of the list of companies to the wrong agency, Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control. OFAC is an enforcement agency, and such investigation is not in its mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the job is better entrusted to an interagency task force combining  the varied strengths of the Departments of Treasury, State, and Energy, along with the SEC. This combined approach will mean that our efforts toward divestment are as fair, effective, targeted, and transparent as they can be. So I have proposed amending the divestment bill to that effect; a second amendment authorizes $2 million to make this divestment task force a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But whatever form they take, sanctions need to pass now. As the UN/AU force stabilizes Darfur, we must do our utmost to choke off the money that has oiled the machinery of slaughter. To those of my colleagues who are standing in the way of swift action, I ask:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What more do you need to see?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What more do we need to prove?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What more could it possibly take to move you?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="180">H.R. 180</bill>, as amended, and the two other strong Senate bills.</paragraph>
