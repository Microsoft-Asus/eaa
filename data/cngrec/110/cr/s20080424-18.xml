    <paragraph>Mr. President, I see that my colleague is here, Senator Inouye of Hawaii. Before I make my statement on <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, I yield time to the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in 1898, when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish-American War, we found ourselves suddenly becoming a colonial power. In opposition was the Philippines. Until the end of the war, World War II, we exercised jurisdiction over the Philippines like a colonial power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in July of 1941, when we noted the presence of war clouds over the Pacific and Asia, we called upon the Filipinos to consider volunteering to serve the United States under American command. Thirteen days after December 7, we issued a command order inviting Filipinos to volunteer--it was a crucial time--and 470,000 Filipinos volunteered. From that number, we developed the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines--200,000. We set aside 200,000 of them to serve as guerrilla fighters and about  50,000 to serve as guards and patrols on the shore and along the borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History now shows us the Japanese attack, and as a result we had two tragic battles, Corregidor and Bataan. Before these battles were determined and ended, General MacArthur, the commander, was ordered to leave the Philippines, and he left with his staff and arrived in Australia. The Filipinos were left to do their part without proper armament, proper medicine, and with inadequate food. But they fought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think all of us remember the Bataan Death March when 75,000 were ordered to march 65 miles without food, medicine, or water. Along that trip, only 54,000 survived--the rest died. I think all of us recall the heroic movies that were filmed as a result of that march. The Bataan Death March became part of the vocabulary of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw Americans being bayoneted, hit, and killed. But the facts show that of the over 75,000 who had to undergo and suffer the Bataan Death March, 15,000 were Americans and 60,000 were Filipinos. They are the ones who got bayoneted. They are the ones who were slaughtered and killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, these Filipinos were willing to fight for the United States, to stand in harm's way on our behalf. They fought throughout the war as guerilla fighters. They suffered thousands of casualties. Those who were fighting for America's cause and fighting under the command of American officers, strangely, could not receive American medals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if one should go to Baghdad, if he is wounded, he gets a Purple Heart. If he does something heroic, he gets a Bronze Star or Silver Star or DSC. Once in a while, someone gets a Medal of Honor. Well, in this case, these matters were not recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war ended on September 2, 1945, when the Japanese signed the surrender on the deck of the USS Missouri. At that moment, we did not have an ambassador nor an embassy, but we had a high commissioner who was not authorized to accept applications for citizenship. Remember, one of the promises was citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So about December, Washington sent an official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to receive applications from Filipinos. Well, he had no staff; he had to do it all on his own. But within a month, Washington decided to recall him. So here we had line upon line of Filipinos waiting to submit their application but no one to receive it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, in early February of 1946, the Congress of the United States passed a measure signed by the President repealing and rescinding the act that we passed in July of 1941, and the Executive order that was issued right after December 7, in which we promised Filipinos if they fought for us, shed their blood, risked their lives and limbs, if they wished they could become citizens of the United States and get all of the veterans' benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keep in mind Manila was the most devastated city in World War II, so there were no veterans hospitals. That came later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, this veterans bill has a provision in it--a provision of honor--in which, finally, after over 65 years, we will restore our honor and tell the Filipinos: It is late, but please forgive us. There are few remaining of the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who volunteered and risked their lives. At this moment, I think there are about 18,000 left. As I speak, I am certain some are on their deathbed and dying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision has some rather insulting provisions, but the Filipinos are willing to take it. Some of my colleagues have suggested that the cost of living in the Philippines is less than the cost of living here, so their pension should be one-third of an American GI's, who did the same thing, with the same injury--but one-third. That is all right. But to suggest only those who were in combat, I don't know what that means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in Iraq, whether you are out on the street or on the boulevard in a truck or in the so-called Green Zone, you are on the front line. Bombs can hit you anywhere. It is the same thing with a guerrilla fighter. Where is the front line for a guerrilla fighter? Is it the jungle? Is it the city? Is it his home?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, I hope we will take this opportunity today to restore the honor of the United States and undo the broken promise and make it good. There are a few Filipino World War II veterans left. At least we can face them and say: Yes, it took us a little while, but we are going to carry out our promise. Let's do that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, how much time is left?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Hawaii has 20 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very pleased that <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, as reported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the proposed Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007, is finally before the Senate for consideration and action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my huge gratitude to the majority leader, also the minority leader, and especially to my friend, the ranking member, for coming to an agreement for our offering today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This comprehensive legislation would improve benefits and services for veterans both old and young.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Veterans' Affairs Committee reported <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> to the full Senate in August of last year. At that time, my belief was that debate and consideration of this legislation by the full Senate, would take place during September. That did not happen. Now we have a good agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have described in detail this week, further action on the bill has been blocked because of opposition from the other side of the aisle to certain benefits for Filipinos who fought under U.S. command during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the people of the Philippines did not shy from the call to fight during World War II. They were true brothers in arms who fought valiantly under U.S. command in World War II. This bill, at long last, recognizes the valor of all Filipino veterans in sacrifice to this noble cause and loyalty to their American commanders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an Executive order ordering all military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States under the command of a newly created command structure called the U.S. Armed Forces of the Far East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to orders from General MacArthur, Philippine units once mustered into U.S. service would be paid and supplied from American sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unique relationship between the Philippines and the United States made the Philippine islands particularly susceptible to Japanese aggression during the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historians agree that the Japanese strategy was based upon a plan to destroy or neutralize the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, and to deprive the United States of its base in the Philippines. Were it not for the U.S. presence, the Philippines would not have presented the Japanese with a strategic threat and turned into a battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Philippine forces under U.S. command suffered heavy casualties as a result of the Japanese invasion. It is estimated that 10,000 Filipinos died during the Bataan Death March, along with 3,000 U.S. soldiers. The Philippines, throughout the war, suffered great loss of life and tremendous physical damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the end of the war, the capital city of Manila was in ruins and up to one million Filipinos had been killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October 1945, General Omar Bradley, then Director of the Veterans' Administration, affirmed that all Filipinos who served under U.S. command were entitled to all benefits under laws administered by that agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in 1946, the U.S. Congress, through the Rescissions Act of 1946, withdrew veteran status from certain Filipino veterans of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon passage of the Rescissions Act, President Harry Truman expressed his disapproval of the withdrawal of benefits from Filipino veterans. He stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no question, but that the Philippine veteran who is entitled to benefits bearing a reasonable relation to those received by the American veteran, with whom he fought side by side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The action by Congress in 1946 to strip Filipino veterans who served under the American flag during World War II of the recognition and benefits that were their due was a grave injustice. It is especially regrettable that this injustice has existed for so many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to speak briefly about the purpose of pension benefits and more specifically about the pension benefit in the pending bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans' pension benefits are provided to allow veterans to live in dignity and meet their basic needs. The amounts proposed in this legislation would permit Filipino veterans who have been denied their rightful status as United States veterans for too long to finally live in dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike other World War II veterans, these veterans have been denied pension benefits for over 60 years. It is also important to note that these benefits are not retroactive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amounts proposed are sufficient to give aged Filipino veterans a payment that would allow them to meet their basic needs for adequate nutrition and medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pension proposed for Filipino veterans is less than one-third of the basic amount provided to veterans living in the United States, in recognition of the lower cost of living in the Philippines. Measured against the aid and attendance standard, the proposed benefit is about one-sixth of the amount provided to veterans in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the income and asset verification procedures used in the United States are not available in the Philippines, and it is not feasible to develop an administratively efficient system in the Philippines to monitor the income and assets of pension recipients, the bill provides a flat benefit amount substantially lower than that paid in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe firmly that the proposed amount is a reasonable benefit taking into account all of these factors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said time and time again, this legislation would correct an injustice that has existed for over 60 years. I, like President Truman, believe it is the obligation of the United States to care for those who have fought under the U.S. flag. It is past time to right that wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my fellow World War II veteran, the senior Senator from Alaska, said only yesterday, this is about honor. I believe it is the moral obligation of this Nation to provide for those who served under the U.S. flag and alongside the U.S. troops during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The soldier's creed is to leave no fellow warrior behind. I believe in that creed. I believe it is important to acknowledge the valiant service of those Filipino veterans of World War II who served under U.S. command.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007 would recognize the service and sacrifice of Filipino veterans who fought under our flag in World War II. I join my good friends and fellow World War II veterans, Senator INOUYE and Senator AKAKA, in supporting the restoration of veterans benefits to these heroic individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Filipino troops fought as American nationals, under the American flag, alongside American soldiers, and under the command of American GEN Douglas MacArthur, earning themselves the status of U.S. veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like most American troops, Filipino soldiers were effectively drafted into the U.S. military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When war with Japan became imminent, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the military forces of the Philippines into the service of the U.S. Armed Forces. The President held this authority because the Philippine Islands were a U.S. possession and the power was written into our law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The position of these Filipino soldiers was similar to the thousands of courageous Alaskans who volunteered to serve in the Alaska Territorial Guard and protect Alaska before it became a state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 60 years later, in 2000, Congress determined that the service of the Alaska Territorial Guard was "active duty" service, making them eligible for the same veterans benefits Filipino veterans now seek.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just 10 hours after the attack on the U.S. at Pearl Harbor, Japan invaded the Philippines. In the years of war that followed, Filipino soldiers fought alongside American troops with uncommon valor and loyalty to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stories of their heroism and sacrifice are abundant. Outnumbered by the Japanese and forced out of Manila, Filipino soldiers and U.S. troops held  their ground for months before being forced to surrender on the Bataan Peninsula and in Corregidor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 80,000 Filipino and U.S. soldiers were taken prisoner and forced to walk to a prison camp over 65 miles away in what became known as the infamous "Death March." As many as one in three of these men, weakened by disease and malnutrition and tortured by their captors, died before reaching their destination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After their American leader, GEN Douglas MacArthur, was ordered to Australia, thousands of Filipino guerilla soldiers continued resisting Japanese occupation for nearly 3 years. When MacArthur and allied forces returned, Filipino soldiers fought fiercely until Japan's surrender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One million Filipino combatants and noncombatants died in World War II. In comparison, approximately 400,000 U.S. troops lost their lives in all theaters of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As President Truman would later say of the Filipino troops: "Their assignment was as bloody and difficult as any in which our American soldiers engaged."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should remember the vital contributions of Filipino veterans to the success of the allied forces. Their resistance distracted the Japanese in the Islands, preventing them from deploying elsewhere and possibly reaching the U.S. mainland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These soldiers bought precious time for General MacArthur to mount a successful counterstrike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, the U.S. Veterans' Administration determined these service members met the definition of "active Service" in the U.S. Armed Forces and were eligible for full VA benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Rescission Acts of 1946, however, many Filipino veterans' World War II service no longer qualified as `active duty' service. Congress stripped these soldiers of the benefits they had earned. Filipino veterans and their advocates have fought for the Restoration of these benefits for more than 60 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill contains provisions that would restore U.S. veteran status to all Filipino World War II Veterans, increase service-connected disability compensation, and provide a reduced flat rate pension to many Filipino veterans residing in the Philippines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonservice-connected pension and death pension benefits are available to all qualifying U.S. veterans regardless of race, national origin, or citizenship status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Filipino World War II veterans and their survivors have been excluded from receiving these benefits. This bill proposes a reasonable and fair way to assist to these veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The expense of this reduced benefit is justified by the contribution of Filipino veterans to this country. If not for their service, the fate of the United States could have been very different. For this, they should be treated as American veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed benefit would cost only a fraction of what it would have if pensions were made available to alL Filipino veterans who were entitled. The Embassy of the Philippines claims there were 470,000 Filipino veterans after the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today only about 18,000 of these veterans--most in their eighties--still survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Filipino World War II veterans residing in the Philippines have been denied eligibility for pension benefits for more than 60 years. A pension benefit about one third the size of that available to veterans in the United States is not overly generous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope Congress will recognize the service of all our Filipino World War II Veterans just as we have for the Alaska Territorial Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time we show our Nation's gratitude for the role Filipino World War II veterans played in our history, fighting alongside soldiers from the U.S. and helping us secure victory over tyranny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, for the comments he made. I do believe this is a matter of honor. I understand how some of the younger Senators might view this as being costly, but I wish to put it in perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I pointed out, there were approximately 1 million Filipinos killed in action in the defense of our country in World War II. Approximately a half a million survived. Actually, during the war, as I have also pointed out, President Roosevelt said all Filipinos were subject to service in our Armed Forces; in effect, he conscripted the Filipinos to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who survived were treated at first as our veterans on the mainland. Subsequently, it was determined that those who came to our country, to the mainland, would be treated fully as veterans of all types in the country were treated. We have to remember, this was an all-male military, primarily a draftee Army of over 16 million men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First the VA determined all Filipino veterans were subject to the same laws as in the United States. If a person came to the United States as a veteran from the Philippines, he was automatically given citizenship and entitled to full benefits of all the veterans laws, including the GI bill, the right to have money to build a home, and a lot of other benefits were involved in those actions taken by Congress to try and deal with the returning veterans and help them regain their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later, it was determined that those benefits would not be paid to many of those who stayed in the Philippines. We have been trying for many years to restore those payments. I commend the Senators from Hawaii for trying to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Actually, we had a parallel situation in the Alaska Guard. The Alaska Guard was primarily made up of Eskimos and Alaska Native people who patrolled the borders of Alaska. I remind the Senate that we have half the coastline of the United States. Those people who were in the Alaska Guard patrolled with their dogsleds without any uniforms being issued to them. It took us a period of time until we were able to recognize them, and we did so. We finally awarded those people in the National Guard their  rights as veterans of the United States military forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something we have to do, as far as I am concerned. The provision in this bill restores the benefits these Filipino veterans have earned. I do believe, as I pointed out the other night on the floor, the Senate should know that Senator Inouye and I went to the Philippines this year and met with some of these people. I am 85 this year and my friend is 84, and we were the youngsters at the meeting. These Filipino veterans who are surviving are our age or older. Most of them are infirm.  There are 18,000 left out of the 470,000 plus, almost half a million survivors. This bill restores their benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How long can they last? People who have talked about the cost of this benefit I think misunderstand the situation. This is not a cost of today's economy. This is not a cost for today's taxpayers. This is a burden that should have been borne before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These people have not had these benefits during all of these years, and they have asked us now, as a matter of honor, to restore their rights before they leave this planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, appeal to the Senate. As I said, there are now only five of us from World War II left in the Senate. When I came here, there were more than 70. There would be no question--I didn't know this actually happened, I have to tell you. We discovered a year ago, when Senator Akaka raised it, that this situation exists in the Philippines. I do believe it is an action that must be taken. These people not only now are our allies, but they have warmly supported our efforts throughout  the world. I do believe to recognize the service and sacrifice of these Filipino veterans who fought under our flag in World War II is absolutely essential. These benefits are going to the heroes of the Philippines who are now surviving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I again point out to the Senate, those who lived through that time know if they had not made this sacrifice, if they had not lost two-thirds of their men in World War II, we would not have had the time to rebuild America. We would not have had the time to bring in the forces, to train the people who finally carried the war throughout the world to two tyrants, to Hitler and to the Japanese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not had a world war since that time, and I do hope the world will never see another world war. But these people were the keys to the Pacific. Without them, we would have certainly been at war another couple of years at least and certainly would have seen an exchange of atomic weapons by that time. They gave us the time to survive,  and I think we ought to give them their rights before they leave this planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>

  <chair> Who yields time?</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from North Carolina.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Akaka is a good man and a fair man. He is a wonderful chairman. He has produced a bill which has a tremendous amount of good. I am in deep respect of Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens. This country owes both, as well as all World War II veterans, a tremendous thanks for their commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Stevens mentioned ages, it made me think, on Monday my dad turned 87. He fought in the Pacific. He did it because it was the right thing to do. I believe protection of our veterans is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me, if I may, focus everybody on what <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> is. I ask a chart be put up. One might hear this debate and think this is all about a special pension for Philippine veterans who live in the Philippines who have no service-connected disability. There is a difference. This bill is so much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is $332 million in Philippine benefits, of which $221 million is devoted to a new special pension that does not exist. There is a term life insurance program for our veterans of $83 million over 5 years and $326 million over 10 years; state approving agencies, $60 million; mortgage life insurance for our veterans, $51 million, retroactive traumatic injury, on-the-job training benefits, supplemental insurance, housing grants for burned injured, auto grants for burned injured, COLA for surviving  spouses, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to highlight those items that are mandatory spending in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill. Regardless of the outcome of my amendment, I want my colleagues to support final passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, I highlight the fact that we do have a difference as it relates to the pensions. Before I get into the specifics of why I believe, not as some have portrayed it that I believe it is too costly, I believe that, one, there was not a promise made. We did not imply it. It was not an impression that people had; that, in fact, when we look back at those individuals who served in this Chamber who made the decision on the Rescissions Act, they looked at the history very well. They looked  at what Franklin Roosevelt said and the documents that backed it up. They looked at what General MacArthur said and the documents that backed it up. And they felt this was not the way for us to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to yield a short period of time to my colleague, Senator Cornyn.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Texas is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Burr's leadership on this issue. I, too, express my appreciation, and I have to say our two Senators from Hawaii are beloved by all Members of this Senate and people whom we respect enormously, as well as the Senator from Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father was a veteran of World War II, and the service each of these veterans has provided for our country and for our freedom and security is something we can never thank them for enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with Senator Burr that this bill is largely a very good bill, and I am proud to have contributed some provisions that helped enhance veterans' benefits, primarily by cutting redtape that would allow disabled Active-Duty Military personnel to get housing benefits before they officially retire from Active Duty; making family members eligible for housing grants if they are caring for a wounded warrior--and I especially want to recognize the good work of Rosie Babin, the mother of  Alan Babin, of Round Rock, TX, who brought this to my attention, and so now we have this provision--and ensuring that burn victims are eligible for housing grants--and this is an area where I want to recognize the work of Christy Patten, the wife of Everett</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the good work our Filipino allies contributed to our effort in the Far East, but I have to say that the problem I have with this bill, and the reason why I agree with Senator Burr, is that the U.S. Treasury is not bottomless, and the funding that is being provided to create this new pension for these Filipino allies, which were of course fighting not only with us but for themselves and for the freedom of their country, is that it would literally be at the expense of U.S.  veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $221 million that is addressed by Senator Burr's amendment would actually go back in to supplement benefits for United States veterans. And while we appreciate and honor and do nothing but show our respect to all of our allies who fought alongside of us in World War II, certainly that doesn't mean we are going to grant pension benefits to all of our allies, starting with the Filipino veterans, or the British, or the Australians, and all the other allies that fought with us in defeating  Hitler and the threat in Japan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, I can't see our priorities are correct if we do this at the expense of American veterans. That is why I support the amendment by Senator Burr, and I hope our colleagues will vote for it, because certainly our American veterans should be our priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me highlight one area from these 11 points of the substance of Senator Akaka's bill, and it is the creation of a new special pension of $300 a month to Filipino veterans who live in the Philippines who have no service-connected disability and who did not serve in the United States services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the reason I want to draw that distinction--and I will ask for the next chart--is there are four groups of Filipino veterans. It is important to understand that the group we refer to as Old Scouts enlisted in the U.S. Army. Because they enlisted in the U.S. Army, they are extended every benefit a U.S. veteran has. We had three other groups, though, the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, Recognized Guerilla Forces, and New Philippine Scouts. Of those three categories, none were enlisted  in the U.S. service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Inouye was correct, they were under U.S. command. There were a lot of people in the Second World War who were under the U.S. command. But the official account lists this as the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines. Now, the question that is at the heart of the matter here is: Were Filipino veterans promised VA benefits? According to the information provided in a 1998 congressional hearing, the Department of the Army examined its holdings on General McArthur and President Roosevelt  and found no reference by either of these wartime leaders to post-war benefits for Filipino veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me draw a distinction. For any Philippine veteran who has a service-connected disability, they are compensated today, whether they live in the United States or whether they live in the Philippines. For the soldier in the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, those whom Senator Stevens referred to from the Bataan Death March or side by side in the foxhole, and who had a service-connected disability, they receive compensation from the U.S. Government today, and have continually. The  reference that they only got part of what the U.S. vet gets is, in fact, accurate. Because of the difference in the two economies, it was structured to recognize their economy and not to provide more than an equal share to U.S. veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we make a change, and that is why, when I alluded to the fact there is $320 some million designated for Filipinos but only $221 million designated to the special new pension, the other $100 million Senator Akaka has recognized that 50 cents on the dollar is very difficult to substantiate. What he does is he raises it dollar for dollar with U.S. veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me put that in perspective. For a 100-percent disabled veteran in the Philippines today, it means today they get $1,200 a month. After this bill passes, they will get $2,400 a month, in an economy where the average annual income is $2,800 a month. We will take every servicemember, regardless of which of those three branches of the commonwealth army they served in, and they will be in the elite class from  a standpoint of income. I support that.  I support Senator Akaka's change in the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the root issue raised is: They were promised something more. Was it Congress's intent to grant full VA benefits to Filipino veterans? First, it is important to  note that it was a 1942 VA legal opinion which concluded that Filipino veterans had served "in the active military or naval service of the United States" and on that basis were eligible for VA benefits. Senator Carl Hayden, who in 1946 was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations, had this to say about VA's legal determination regarding Philippine Army veterans during the committee proceedings in March of that year:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing to indicate that there was any discussion of the meaning of that term, probably because it is generally well recognized and has been used in many statutes having to do with members or former members of the American armed forces. It would normally be construed to include persons regularly enlisted or inducted in the regular manner in the military and naval service of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But no one could be found who would assert that it was ever the clear intention of Congress that such benefits as are granted--under the GI Bill of Rights--should be extended to the soldiers of the Philippine Army. There is nothing in the text of any of the laws enacted by Congress for the benefit of veterans to indicate such intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes further to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is certainly unthinkable that Congress would extend the normal meaning of the term to cover the large number of Filipinos to whom it has been suggested that the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1940 applies, at a cost running into billions of dollars, aside from other considerations, without some reference to it either in the debates in Congress or in the committee reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe this is the debate in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue was raised in 1997, and in June of that year, when the Clinton administration was asked to testify on this, Stephen Lemons, Acting Under Secretary for Benefits, was quoted in the hearing as saying this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History shows that the limitations on eligibility for U.S. benefits based on service in these Philippine forces were based on a carefully considered determination of the government's responsibilities toward them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They testified against extending that benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1948, there was a House hearing, and in that House hearing there was an exchange between witnesses and Members of the House. There was a Father Haggarty who came to testify, and I read from the official accounts of that hearing. This is Father Haggarty:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was constantly promised, as the ambassador mentioned, in radio broadcasts, official American broadcasts to the Philippines in the war. It was definitely promised by General McArthur, General Wainwright, and also it has been acknowledged, I believe, that the Philippine groups recognized the guerrillas, acting as members of the United States Armed Forces, were entitled at one time to complete GI bill of rights. That is, they were included. I believe that is correct, and were later left out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Allen, Member:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May I say there, Father, I know you are sincere about it, but I think you are in error. Because there are three or four of us here on the committee who were present when the GI bill was written, and I don't think that ever entered into it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the individuals who wrote the GI bill in a committee hearing are verifying that was not even discussed, much less their intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of documents that have existed as committees have held hearings over a period of time from the Department of the Army, from the Roosevelt library. There have been searches everywhere to try to find any documentation that would lead one to believe that there was a promise, that there was an insinuation, and the fact is, whether it is Roosevelt documents, whether it is Army documents, whether it is General MacArthur's personal documents, no one can find anything, other than "we  believe this existed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What factors influenced Congress's decision to limit certain VA benefits to Philippine veterans in what is known as the Rescissions Act of 1946, where it was made perfectly clear in legislation that this was going to happen? Well, you have heard it from the authors of the GI bill. "We never intended this to be extended." The Congressional Research Service testimony in April of 2007 provided the following conclusion based on its review of the congressional history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems clear that Congress considered the Rescissions Act in the context of providing for the comprehensive economic development of the soon to be sovereign Republic of the Philippines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Truman, in signing the Rescissions Act, reminded everyone in the United States that we shared responsibility with the Philippine Government for the welfare of Philippine veterans, but recognized that certain practical difficulties exist in applying the GI bill of rights to the Philippines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the second President in the line suggesting that this was not the intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, we extend disability compensation to any Filipino veteran, regardless of Commonwealth Army or of the U.S. Army, who was injured in service or disabled because of service. Now, what have we done? What specifically has the United States done since we left the Philippines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, the U.S. provided $620 million--in today's dollars that is $6.7 billion--for repair of public property and war damage claims and assistance to the Philippine Government. VA compensation for service-related disabilities, as I said, and survivor compensation was also provided, and again paid at a rate that reflected differences in the cost of living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are changing that. We are raising it to 100 percent. The United States provided $22.5 million--$196 million in today's dollars--for the construction and equipping of a hospital in the Philippines for the care of Filipino veterans. In addition, the U.S. Government provides annual grants to support the operation of the hospital, which was later donated to the Philippine Government. The grants continue to exist today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Survivors of the Filipino veterans who died as a result of service are eligible for educational assistance benefits. Filipino veterans legally residing in the United States are eligible for full-rate disability compensation, full-rate cash burial benefits, full access to the VA health care clinics, medical centers, and burial in our national cemeteries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not sure anybody can leave this debate and say we have not done our share. So we are back to one issue: the special pension. We are back to the creation of a special pension for some number of Filipinos who served or were affiliated with the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines that would place them in a pension category of $300 a month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will ask for the last chart to go up. I made this case 2 days ago extremely hard, and I want my colleagues to listen. The proposal to raise $300 is on top of what is currently paid by the Filipino Government to every veteran. That is $120 a month. That $120 a month in the Philippines puts every veteran 400 percent above the poverty line in the Philippines. Let me put it in perspective to the United States. For our veterans who receive a special pension because of income, that pension equates  to 10 percent above the poverty line. Today, the $120 a month equates to 400 percent above the poverty line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are being asked to do in 1315, and what I am cutting from 1315 and allocating to our veterans, is $300 a month, which would raise the Filipino veterans to 1400 percent over poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, that is 27 percent over the median annual income of a Filipino.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might once again say, for U.S. veterans under special pensions, they are 10 percent above poverty; they are at 21 percent of median income--under, not over. This one change, this one creation of a new program, puts the whole group at 1400 percent over the poverty line and 27 percent over the median income. This is on top of the $1,200, if they are fully disabled, that they are currently getting each month. What Senator Akaka will do in his bill, and I support, raises that to $2,400  if they are 100 percent disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleagues, we are not here to create another class in the Philippines. I hold Senator Inouye's and Senator Stevens' belief that we owe these individuals so much--but so do we to our veterans, to my dad who just turned 87 who fought in the Pacific. Senator Craig, in the committee markup, attempted to reach a compromise. He offered $100 versus $300. It was rejected. The chairman knows I do not have any ill will over that; a decision was made, and it was rejected  on a party-line vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope--and I say this to the chairman today--I hope this is the last time while I am here when the Veterans' Affairs Committee brings a bill to the floor that does not have the bipartisan consensus that history has proven, and I think he and I can accomplish that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We inherited something on which we were incapable of coming to some compromise, so we have a tough decision to make. That decision today is about, frankly, our veterans or their veterans. Are we going to enhance the benefits for housing grants and for car grants or are we going to create a new special pension for Filipino veterans who live in the Philippines who have no service-connected disability? It is an issue of, Is it equitable?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What my amendment does is simple. It eliminates this new special pension and takes the $221 million and increases the grants that we have in adaptive housing for our burned veterans and for car grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We respect and we are grateful for the brave Filipino fighters, but this is about today, not yesterday. It is about the needs of our veterans, the equity of our generosity. It is not about broken promises, it is about recognizing priorities. It is not about young Members looking and saying that is too much money. No, it is about young Members looking and saying: You know what, when you can't fund everything you have to prioritize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, I implore my colleagues, support my amendment and make sure we put our priorities in the right place. Then vote for passage. Support the chairman in his efforts for passage and know that each one of us will have upheld our responsibilities to our warriors, those individuals who protect us every day we are here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Veterans' Benefit Enhancement Act we are debating contains a number of important benefits to provide for our veterans. It would expand eligibility for traumatic injury insurance, provide job training, and help disabled veterans make their homes more accessible. That is all worthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also another issue. In 1941, President Roosevelt called on the people of the Philippines to fight for their freedom and ours, and thousands of brave Filipinos answered the call. They carried out operations to liberate their homeland and joined us in support of our efforts in the Pacific theater. They fought and died at Corregidor, they were with us on the beaches of Bataan, and in the death marches. They were there when General MacArthur promised he would return, they fought using guerrilla  tactics to tie down the Japanese, and they fought under General MacArthur when he came back and said, "I have returned."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the war, Filipino soldiers fought under the American flag, serving with valor, strength, and dignity. President Roosevelt guaranteed those brave soldiers that the United States would come to their aid in times of peace, just as they had come to our aid during times of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He guaranteed them equal veterans' benefits--a fair promise, considering their service and considering the law of the land, as they were full members of the U.S. military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in 1946 in one of the most misguided legislative actions at the time, Congress took away the benefits that the President of the United States had promised them, benefits they had rightfully earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the approximately 250,000 Filipino veterans who fought for us in America, only 18,000 are still alive today. Many of them are searching for ways to pay for health care and struggling in ways they never should. These veterans have more yesterdays than tomorrows. They are well into their eighties, and in terms of our budget, what this bill would cost over the next 10 years we are spending in Iraq every 18 hours. Those who say it will cost too much are the same voices who said it would cost too  much to do what Democrats did under the leadership of Senator Akaka when, for the first time, we fully funded the veterans independent budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we bring this bill to a vote, we will be answering a very simple but powerful question: Does our Nation keep its promises? We need to right an injustice of the past and show our allies, for future purposes as well, when we tell people to join us in our fight against terrorism, to join us in our fight against other challenges in the world, that America honors its obligations to those who fight for the values and principles we collectively share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a critical time to send a message to friends of freedom across the world that we remember our allies, and we pay our debts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our distinguished colleagues in this Senate who have served during World War II have said this is not simply a question of budget, this is a question of honor. These individuals of honor put their lives on the line for our Nation, and now the honor of our Nation is on the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's just show a fraction of the bravery they did and vote to restore to them what they were promised, what was the law, and what they rightfully earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, like lawyers, there are some who are picking on points here or there to build a case against these benefits. In my mind it is a case made of sand. Let's vote to bring an honorable ending to this story and in however small a way let us pledge now to give them dignity in the twilight of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support Senator Akaka's bill as it is to be able to keep our word in the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the underlying bill that the Senators from Hawaii and North Carolina have put together is a step in the right direction: increasing life insurance benefits, increasing disability benefits--particularly for traumatic brain injury--and doing that retroactively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another portion in here that makes a lot of sense. If under current law a veteran who is deployed to a war zone can get out of his apartment rental contract, why should not he be able to get out of his cell phone lease contract? That provision is in here. That is in the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you what is not in here--I am going to have to take this up on the Defense authorization bill--taking care of the widows and the orphans in the offset between survivor benefits plans and dependents' indemnity compensation--SVPDIC. The veterans' survivors, the widows and orphans, are entitled under both by law--but by law they offset each other. Thus widows and orphans are suffering. We will address that in the Defense authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to expand on what the two Senators from Hawaii have said. There is one thing that America should never do, and that is break her word. When we have allies who are side by side with us in war, and they are depending on our word that we are going to take care of them, it is the obligation of America to do that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of providing benefits to Filipino veterans who served our Nation during World War II. <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007 introduced by Senator Akaka, specifically includes a provision that would restore health and pension benefits to Filipino veterans who fought for the United States during World War II. This provision is based on <bill type="s" number="57">S.57</bill>, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007 originally introduced by Senator Inouye  and which I am proud to cosponsor. I have supported rectifying this injustice since I entered the Senate in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Burr's amendment would strip the provision benefitting Filipino veterans from <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>. I strongly oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1942, President Roosevelt issued an order conscripting Filipino soldiers into the U.S. Armed Forces. More than 250,000 Filipino soldiers joined the U.S. Armed Forces in the months before and days following the attack on Pearl Harbor. These men served on the battlefield and fought courageously alongside American soldiers throughout World War II, took part in the guerilla resistance, and suffered in prisoner-of-war camps including the infamous Bataan Death March in which untold numbers of Americans  and Filipinos soldiers suffered and died under brutal conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States promised these Filipino veterans the same health and pension benefits as those of American servicemembers, but after World War II ended, Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946, rescinding benefits that the Filipino soldiers were entitled to receive as U.S. veterans. Since then, these veterans have been fighting for these benefits which were unjustly revoked by the 1946 Rescission Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reiterate the statements I made recently in honor of the 66th anniversary of the Bataan Death March that this is a matter of restoring the honor and dignity of these courageous veterans. I will continue to support and fight for the Filipino veterans equity bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on July 26, 1941, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order ordering all military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines into service of the Armed Forces of the United States. This happened after a bit of history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1898 the Philippines became a colony of the United States. It was on March 24, 1934, that the Tydings-McDuffie Act passed Congress. That provided for independence for the Philippines. It was mandated in that bill that there would be a 10-year period--that is to 1944--when the Philippines would formalize and shape and develop its entity. But what was mandated was that the United States would provide the control and supervision of the national defense of the Philippines, and also of its foreign  affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was in that bill in 1934. The 10-year period ended in 1944. So the United States was very much a part of the Philippines. In 1941, under the declaration and Executive Order of President Roosevelt, they served in the U.S. Armed Forces of the Far East. All of the military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines remained under the command of the U.S. Armed Forces of the Far East throughout World War II and until the Philippines was granted independence on July 4, 1946.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has a long history of caring for aging veterans, particularly those who served the country during a time of war. Philippine veterans of the Second World War are now in their twilight years, and many are struggling to make ends meet, especially with global food prices on the rise. Now, perhaps more than ever, the modest pension benefits that are in <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> are of the greatest value to veterans who earned them on the battlefield so many years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to stand with me, with my World War II colleagues, Senators Inouye and Stevens, and a majority of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and not accept the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to offer my support for <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. This is a tremendously important piece of legislation, and I commend Senator Akaka and the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill says to the men and women who have served and suffered horrible injuries and paid the price of war, "We have not forgotten you. You and your families deserve the respect and care of a grateful Nation, and we will do all that we can to see to it that you live lives of dignity." Among other things, this legislation enhances life insurance benefits to disabled servicemembers, improves benefits for veterans who need to renovate their homes to accommodate their injuries, and increases  education benefits so our veterans will have an easier time going back to school and getting good jobs when they finish military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But just as important as taking care of our newest generation of veterans, this bill also takes care of some of the oldest veterans who were a part of the "greatest generation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1941, President Roosevelt issued an order that directed the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines to fight alongside our Armed Forces, as he was authorized to do under the Philippine Independence Act of 1934. Some 250,000 Filipinos would swear allegiance to the United States of America in the months before and the days after Pearl Harbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under our flag, they went on to fight and die on the same battlefields as U.S. troops. They gathered intelligence, organized a guerilla resistance against the Japanese invasion of their island home, and assisted in rescue operations of American prisoners of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the fighting stopped, the members of the Filipino Army were to have been eligible for full veterans' benefits, just like American veterans. In October of 1945 GEN Omar Bradley, who at the time was the head of the Veterans' Administration, affirmed that the Filipino soldiers would be treated no differently and were to receive all the benefits that they rightly deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Rescission Act of 1946 changed all that. It stated that the Filipinos who fought alongside Americans had not performed "active service" and that they had no standing or claim to any "rights, privileges, or benefits."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are now only about 18,000 of these heroic Filipinos left. About 13,000 of them are still in the Philippines, where they have waited over 60 years for the United States Government to provide the benefits they were promised and are owed for serving our Nation and defending the cause of freedom. That is what this legislation does. It also extends the benefits available to all U.S. servicemembers to the 5,000 Filipino veterans living here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, for the past 9 months, the other side of the aisle has balked at allowing this legislation to come up for a vote. I am certainly thankful that they have no problem with extending full benefits to Filipino veterans living here. But sadly they feel that $300 a month for a single person and $375 for a married person is too high a pension for someone who lives in the Philippines but fought for the United States 60 years ago and hasn't received a penny since. Instead they are insisting  on no pension at all for these veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am glad that we have now moved to the bill, and we can debate the merits of this vital legislation that will address the needs of those who have paid the price of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Inouye, who has so faithfully lead this effort for the past 16 years and knows what it means to have fought under our flag in World War II, recently stated, "What happened 61 years ago was not right; it was shameful and disgraceful. . . . The legislation is about fairness and dignity--core American values. It is also about correcting an injustice that has stood for way too long."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not agree more, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill and bring these well-deserved and urgently needed benefits to those veterans--both young and old--who have fought on our behalf.</paragraph>
