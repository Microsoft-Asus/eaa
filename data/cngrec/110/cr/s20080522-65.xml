  <narrative>Mr. BROWN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="sr" number="574">S. Res. 574</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the protection of the human rights of minority groups is consistent with the actions of a responsible stakeholder in the international community and with the role of a host of a major international event such as the Olympic Games;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas recent actions taken against the Uyghur minority by authorities in the People's Republic of China and, specifically, by local officials in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, have included major violations of human rights and acts of cultural suppression;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the authorities of the People's Republic of China have manipulated the strategic objectives of the international war on terror to increase their cultural and religious oppression of the Muslim population residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas an official campaign to encourage Han Chinese migration into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has resulted in the Uyghur population becoming a minority in their traditional homeland and has placed immense pressure on those who are seeking to preserve the linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions of the Uyghur people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a new policy now actively recruits young Uyghur women and forcibly transfers  them to work at factories in urban areas in far-off eastern provinces, resulting in tens of thousands of Uyghur women being separated from their families and placed into substandard working conditions thousands of miles from their homes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the legal system of the People's Republic of China is used as a tool of repression, including for the imposition of arbitrary detentions and torture commonly employed against any and all Uyghurs who voice discontent with the Government;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China continues to apply charges of "political crimes" and the death penalty to Uyghurs and other political dissidents, contrary to international humanitarian standards;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the People's Republic of China is implementing a monolingual Chinese language education system that undermines the linguistic basis of Uyghur culture by transitioning minority students from education in their mother tongue to education in Chinese, shifting dramatically away from past policies that provided choice for the Uyghur people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Senate has a particular interest in the fate of Uyghur human rights leader Rebiya Kadeer, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and her family, as Ms. Kadeer was first arrested in August 1999 while she was en route to meet with a delegation from the Congressional Research Service and was held in prison on spurious charges until her release and exile to the United States in the spring of 2005;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas upon her release, Rebiya Kadeer was warned by her Chinese jailers not to advocate for human rights in Xinjiang and throughout China while in the United States or elsewhere, and was reminded that she had several family members residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas while residing in the United States, Rebiya Kadeer founded the International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation and was elected President of the Uyghur American Association and President of the World Uyghur Congress in Munich, Germany;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 2 of Rebiya Kadeer's sons were detained and beaten and one of her daughters was placed under house arrest in June 2006;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President George W. Bush recognized the importance of Rebiya Kadeer's human rights work in a June 5, 2007, speech in Prague, Czech Republic, when he stated: "Another dissident I will meet here is Rebiyah Kadeer of China, whose sons have been jailed in what we believe is an act of retaliation for her human rights activities. The talent of men and women like Rebiyah is the greatest resource of their nations, far more valuable than the weapons of their army or their oil under the ground.";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Kahar Abdureyim, Rebiya Kadeer's eldest son, was fined $12,500 for tax evasion and another son, Alim Abdureyim, was sentenced to 7 years in prison and fined $62,500 for tax evasion in a blatant attempt by local authorities to take control of the Kadeer family's remaining business assets in the People's Republic of China;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas another of Rebiya Kadeer's sons, Ablikim Abdureyim, was beaten by local police to the point of requiring medical attention in June 2006 and has been subjected to continued physical abuse and torture while being held incommunicado in custody since that time;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Ablikim Abdureyim was also convicted by a kangaroo court on April 17, 2007, for "instigating and engaging in secessionist" activities and was sentenced to 9 years of imprisonment, this trial being held in secrecy and Mr. Abdureyim reportedly being denied the right to legal representation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 2 days later, on April 19, 2007, another court in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, sentenced Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil to life in prison for "splittism" and also for "being party to a terrorist organization" after having successfully sought his extradition from Uzbekistan where he was visiting relatives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas authorities in the People's Republic of China have continued to refuse to recognize Huseyin Celil's Canadian citizenship, although he was naturalized in 2005, denied Canadian diplomats access to the courtroom when Mr. Celil was sentenced, and have refused to grant consular access to Mr. Celil in prison;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China publicly warned Canada "not to interfere in China's domestic affairs" after Huseyin Celil's sentencing;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Huseyin Celil's case was a major topic of conversation in a recent Beijing meeting between the Foreign Ministers of Canada and the People's Republic of China; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there have been recent armed crackdowns throughout the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region against the Uyghur population: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the Government of the People's Republic of China--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) should recognize, and seek to ensure, the linguistic, cultural, and religious rights of the Uyghur people of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) should immediately release the children of Rebiya Kadeer from both incarceration and house arrest and cease harassment and intimidation of the Kadeer family members;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) should immediately release Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil and allow him to rejoin his family in Canada; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) should immediately cease all Government-sponsored violence and crackdowns against the people throughout the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, including those involved in peaceful protests and political expression.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 574--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SHOULD IMMEDIATELY RELEASE FROM CUSTODY THE CHILDREN OF REBIYA KADEER AND CANADIAN CITIZEN HUSEYIN CELIL AND SHOULD REFRAIN FROM FURTHER ENGAGING IN ACTS OF CULTURAL, LINGUISTIC, AND RELIGIOUS SUPPRESSION DIRECTED AGAINST THE UYGHUR PEOPLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Chinese people have endured an unspeakable tragedy, as we know, with the loss of tens of thousands in a major earthquake. Those numbers continue to grow. On the radio this morning, I heard it looks like more than 50,000 Chinese people have died in one of the greatest tragedies of the last decade. My prayers are with the people of Sichuan Province and all those brave men and women who are there now providing support as volunteers, especially providing support to the  Chinese people in Sichuan Province.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to focus on something else in China. This isn't the Chinese people, it is the actions of a few people at the top of the Chinese Government--actions we must confront. When I say "only a few people at the top," the Chinese Government is called the People's Republic of China for a reason. It is a Communist government, a very top-line hierarchical system, where a few people at the top enjoy so much of the benefits and so much of the power and they wield that so unfairly and immorally and,  many times, against so many in their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For us to ignore the behavior of the Chinese Government, to dismiss that behavior, to minimize that behavior is a reprehensible act on our part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a little more than 3 months, the world will witness one of its great quadrennial events--the summer Olympic Games. The games have been billed as a way for the host, China, to reintroduce itself--a new China, if you will--to the international community. And China has pulled out all the stops: $38 billion in infrastructure improvements, including a brandnew 91,000-seat stadium, 300 miles of new roads, and an entirely new terminal at Beijing's International Airport, all because of the Olympic  Games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What China will not be highlighting is its human rights record. That is because it is abysmally disgraceful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As China rolls out the red carpet to welcome hundreds of thousands of tourists and as Olympic-related media flock to Beijing to watch the events, no one will be allowed to go to Tibet, no one will be allowed to go to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, no one will be allowed to see the hundreds of political prisons, no one will be allowed to visit the areas of China where hundreds of millions live in abject poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Amnesty International--a no more respected and fairminded group in the world--said of China:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An increased number of ..... journalists were harassed, detained, and jailed. Thousands of people who pursued their faith outside officially sanctioned churches were subjected to harassment and many to detention and imprisonment. Thousands of people were sentenced to death of executed. Migrants from rural areas were deprived of basic rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Presiding officer, from the State of Rhode Island, has talked passionately about the freedom of the press and journalism in countries where we have the kind of relationship we have with China and how important it is. Others in this body have talked about human rights and labor rights, and now China has violated those values we hold dear and that international organizations that serve all of the world hold so dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beijing will continue to attempt to paint its repressive regime during the Olympics in the best light possible, as we have seen in the last month with the unnerving events in Tibet. The repression in Tibet, a region similar in its treatment by the government as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is nothing new. For almost 60 years, Tibetans have survived under Beijing repression. Tibet was swallowed up by China in 1950. The Uyghur Autonomous Region was swallowed up by China the year before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's policy is straightforward: Declare war on human rights, bring in native Chinese for the best jobs, eradicate the indigenous culture, the language, the spiritual center, disperse the population. It seems to have worked for China's interest every time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's policies keep import prices low by allowing inhumane treatment of  workers, slave wages, and unsafe working conditions have become all too common.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China, the Communist regime, has become China, the world's largest one-company town where workers are interchangeable, replaceable parts and where members of the Communist Party are its shareholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States as purportedly the world leader in human rights--we talk about exporting democracy, we brag about our values, yet out business is with encouragement and incentives--unbelievably enough, sometimes from our own Government--even though we say we are the world leader in human rights. The United States should not be endorsing in any way the brutal and horrific policies of the Chinese Government. Again, the United States, by our actions by the Government and by business do not seem  so interested oftentimes in human rights in China in spite of what we say. We should not be sacrificing our moral compass at the altar of the dollar. We do that way too often.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met with Rabiya Kadeer, the Uyghur dissident leader and head of the Uyghur American Association. She told me of her time in prison for political advocacy on behalf of her people. She spent 6 long years in prison, arrested in 1999 on her way to a meeting with foreign activists and leaders. She told me of her children who either live in fear or live in prison because of her advocacy on behalf of basic freedoms for the 12 or 13 million Uyghur people. She told me of her exile. She is not allowed  to return to her native country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need the strength to stand up to rather than apologize for China's brutal regime. This has been the systematic policy of a highly efficient and powerful central government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chinese Uyghurs have long fought for more autonomy from Beijing and greater freedom to practice their Muslim religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a new policy. We have seen the same in the Zinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region where ethnic Uyghur people have been systematically relocated and repressed. Their Turkic language is prohibited, their women are placed into forced labor, especially young women taken out of the Autonomous Region to other parts of China, in many cases to be slave labor, forced labor, in other cases to be sex slaves, and their political leaders are jailed. Yet we allow China into the World Health Organization,  the World Trade Organization, and made them a preferred trading partner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Communities across America feel the reverberations of this policy. Not only does it blacken our name as a country when China violates every kind of human rights we care about, but then it affects our country in so many other ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs across this country since President Bush has been President. Many of these jobs have been eliminated because of government-subsidized imports from China, because of cheating on currency rules, and because of direct off shoring to countries such as China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China gives their manufacturers that unfair competitive advantage by manipulating its currency and providing massive subsidies to its industry. We know all that. American companies have been complicit by hiring Chinese subcontractors and forcing those subcontractors to continue to cut costs, meaning contaminated vitamins, contaminated pharmaceuticals, and dangerous toxic lead-based paint on toys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am submitting a resolution today calling on the Chinese to free the Kadeer children, free the Uyghur political prisoners, and end the political, religious, and ethnic repression in that part of China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to take a look at this resolution, to meet with Ms. Kadeer and to join me in working to bring the atrocities against the Uyghur people to an end. Instead of welcoming China, celebrating China, and trading with China on their terms, as we all talk about the great quadrennial events of the international Olympic Games, we should be helping China's repressed. We should not indulge China its abuses. It dishonors our own values.</paragraph>
