  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chair, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, and yield myself such time as I may consume for an opening statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the National Academies assembled a blue-ribbon committee of national leaders in academia, business and government to address concerns about the national prosperity and the global economy in the 21st century. The Academies' report was entitled, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future." That report catalogs a number of worrisome indicators and presents recommendations that the Nation must follow to maintain its competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What did this distinguished committee tell us is most important to the future of the economic health of our Nation? Here is the first recommendation from the report: Increase America's talent pool by vastly improving K-12 science and mathematics education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Gathering Storm report goes on to tell us where the focus should be in efforts to improve K-12 science and mathematics education. In brief, it says, "Focus on the teachers." <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> follows that blueprint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, I partnered with Mr. Hall, ranking minority member on the Committee on Science and Technology, to introduce <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, whose purpose is to implement all of the action items from the Gathering Storm report and address the report's first recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Mr. Hall for his assistance in developing this bill. With his support, it was favorably reported by the Science and Technology Committee by a unanimous vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill is endorsed by a wide variety of educational organizations and business coalitions, including the Association of American Universities, the Business Roundtable, the Council of Competitiveness, the National Education Association, the National  Science Teachers Association, and the STEM Education Coalition. These organizations are enthusiastic about <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> because it will dramatically improve the national corps of math and science teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We call the first title of the bill "10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act." The bill will create thousands of new teachers with content and teaching skill expertise in their area of teaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vehicle for accomplishing this goal is the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation. Noyce awards go to universities that build model programs for recruiting math and science students into teaching. These programs provide mentoring, early field experiences, and a streamlined path toward teaching certification. Students who enroll in this program will receive $10,000-per-year scholarships. In return, they will make commitments of several years to the teaching profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will also create summer institutes and graduate programs that provide sustained, content-oriented professional development to in-service teachers through the Math and Science Partnership Program at the National Science Foundation. We have a critical shortage of math and science teachers in the U.S., and many of our math and science teachers have no degree or certification in the field they teach. In fact, 87 percent of middle school and 58 percent of high school physical science teachers  lack these qualifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill tackles this problem from both ends. On the one end, we bring in a new cadre of math and science teachers who are well-educated and well-prepared. That is what the Noyce program does. On the other end, we improve the teachers that we have through innovative, effective programs led by disciplinary faculty from higher education. That is what the Math and Science Partnerships program does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other provisions of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> include an expansion of the STEM Talent Expansion Program at the National Science Foundation, a program to enhance the undergraduate education of the future science and engineering workforce, and a pilot program at the NSF to improve laboratory science in high-need secondary schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To maintain our high national standard of living, we need a workforce that is prepared in a world-class math and science education system. But there is a dark cloud looming. American students have performed poorly in recent years on an assortment of international tests of math and science achievement. That does not bode well for the future. Our next generation of innovators, where will they come from? That is what the gathering storm on the horizon is all about. To rise above it, we need to reform  the math and science teaching profession. That is what this legislation now before us will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stakes are high and the concern is urgent. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>. In the last Congress, we will remember that the National Academy of Sciences "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report, as well as other reports, emphasized the importance of strengthening science, of strengthening technology, of strengthening engineering and mathematics, those fields of education in the U.S., to ensure that the Nation's workforce can compete globally in high-tech, high-value industries such as information technology, biotechnology,  semiconductor manufacturing and nanotechnology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush followed up on these reports with his American Competitiveness Initiative, and Republicans have led this effort through the 109th Congress, the last Congress, because we understood the importance of promoting innovation to keep our Nation competitive globally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, most of which was included in a majority effort in the last Congress to implement many of the report's suggestions by expanding current programs versus creating duplicative new programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill authorizes programs to improve U.S. math, science and engineering education at all levels, K-12, undergraduate and graduate. These programs will develop and provide teacher training, attract math and science majors to teaching to improve undergraduate math, science and engineering courses and expand interdisciplinary graduate work, primarily by strengthening existing programs at the National Science Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased with the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds title which is modeled on a program at the University of Texas called UTeach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As reported, this is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with Chairman Gordon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in order to request the attention of the distinguished chairman in addressing an important concern relating to the section in <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act of 2007, that amends the National Science Foundation Noyce Scholarship Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the core purpose of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> is to increase the number of STEM teachers with strong content knowledge and teaching expertise serving in America's schools. In particular, the bill authorizes a large expansion of the Noyce program, which gives scholarships to students to become highly qualified teachers in exchange for their service in a public school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the chairman for crafting this very important legislation. It is an essential step in achieving our national goals of promoting innovative behavior and ensuring continued American strength and competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are to expand the STEM pipeline, however, and if our investments in innovation and competitiveness are to pay large dividends, we must work to correct the large gaps in math and science test performance that exist today between underrepresented minority groups, which are concentrated in high need areas and the rest of the population. The first step in improving the participation of underrepresented groups is to prepare them to compete academically in STEM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure that the gentleman will agree that one of the most effective methods for resolving these disparities is by augmenting the number of quality, highly trained teachers serving in high-need areas. This is a job practically tailored for the Noyce Scholarship Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the distinguished chairman for his recognition of this need and for his willingness to work with me on this important issue, and I would like to yield to the gentleman at this point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is absolutely correct. The NSF Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, as amended by <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, is specifically designed to help place highly qualified STEM teachers in every classroom across the Nation. I further agree with the gentleman that it is particularly important to reduce the number of out-of-field teachers in the schools that have a high proportion of minority students, who are currently underrepresented in science and technology.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman, and in order to address the points that we have both made, I would like to suggest to the chairman that we pursue the following: I would request that in conference the distinguished chairman seek to increase the scholarship amount for students who agree to teach in high-need schools from the current $10,000 per year to $12,000 per year over a 3-year period of scholarship support. The intention of this is to increase this scholarship  amount to address the problem of a disproportionate number of high-need schools that have high percentages of out-of-field STEM teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does the chairman believe this is a modification he would find worthy of his support?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield  further, let me first of all thank the gentleman for his recommendation and assure you that it is my intention when we go to conference on <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> to work to increase the size of the Noyce scholarship to $12,000 per year for students who agree to carry out their teaching commitment in high-need schools.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I would also request that we ensure that the provisions requiring NSF to track the types of schools in which Noyce recipients carry out their teaching obligations include an assessment of the effectiveness of the increased scholarship amount on influencing individuals to teach in high-need schools. Does the chairman believe that this is a modification that he would find worthy of supporting?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, I certainly do; and I once again thank the gentleman for bringing this up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman points out, <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> now requires the National Science Foundation track the proportion of Noyce graduates who elect to teach in high-need schools. I will seek to expand this provision in conference to require NSF to assess the effect of increasing the size of scholarships on attracting graduates of the program to teach in high-need schools.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, seeing as that the problem of out-of-field teachers is most severe in high-need schools, I would request that in conference the distinguished chairman pursue modifications to the bill, clarifying that one of the purposes of Noyce is to close the gap between the number of highly qualified STEM teachers in high-need schools and the number of such teachers in non-high-need schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would further request that this policy statement be included in section 103 of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> titled "Policy Objectives." Does the chairman believe that this is a modification he would find worthy of his support?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, once again we are on the same page. I agree with the gentleman that an important goal of the Noyce program is to reduce disparities in the distribution of highly qualified STEM teachers among schools in different regions of the Nation. I support the gentleman's proposed modification to section 103 of the bill and will pursue this change in conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to again thank the distinguished chairman for agreeing to address these points in conference and for the great job that he has done in crafting this very important and vital piece of legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me again thank the gentleman for his constructive efforts in making a good bill even better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record an exchange of letters between the Committee on Science and Technology and the Committee on Education and Labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 3, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN GORDON: I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding regarding consideration of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the "10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act," which was referred to the Committee on Science. As you know, the Committee on Education and Labor has a jurisdictional interest in <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, particularly as we move forward to reauthorize the Higher Education Act this term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the importance of moving this bill forward promptly, I do not intend to request the sequential referral of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> to the Committee on Education and Labor. However, I do so only with the understanding that this procedural route should not be construed to prejudice this Committee's jurisdictional interests and prerogatives on this bill or any other similar legislation and will not be considered as precedent for consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to the Committee on Education  and Labor in the future. In addition, should this bill or similar legislation be considered in a conference with the Senate, I would expect members of the Committee on Education and Labor to be appointed to the conference committee on such measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I ask that you include a copy of our exchange of letters in your committee's report on <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> and in the Congressional Record during the consideration of this bill. If you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to call me. I thank you for your consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Miller,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AND TECHNOLOGY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, April 5, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter regarding the consideration of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the "10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act." I appreciate your waiving your Committee's right to a referral on this bill so that it may move expeditiously to the Floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize your Committee's jurisdiction in this area and will support any request you may make to have conferees on <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> or similar legislation. The exchange of letters between our two committees will be included in the Committee report on <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> and will be inserted in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bart Gordon,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, all of us go back to our districts regularly and meet with our constituents, and some of the most sorrowful meetings I have are with students who have just graduated from high school and say, I can't get a job. I can't get a job. What a shock to them, after years of education. And I am not talking about dropouts. I am talking about students who have studied hard, worked hard, and tried to learn a lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I analyze the problem, much of it circles around the fact that today, and, indeed, all the jobs of the future, require a good understanding of the basic principles of mathematics and science, and many students in today's curriculum are not getting that knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What can we do to help solve that? There are a number of aspects to the problem. Obviously, the first thing is to entice students to take those courses. But, secondly, and more importantly, is to make certain that all those teachers in our high schools across this Nation are adequately trained and adequately prepared to teach math and science courses and do it in a fashion that excites the students and entices them to take these courses so that they will develop the background in math and science  that they need to get a job, both now and in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world has changed. China and India recognized this 20 years ago and changed their educational system. We did not change. We did not recognize what was happening, and so we have to play catch-up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, which I strongly support, is a good bill which will help us to improve U.S. math, science, and engineering education at all levels; K-12, undergraduate and graduate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As most people in Congress know, I am a scientist. What you may not know is that over 40 years ago, I dedicated myself to trying to improve the science educational programs in the United States, basically from preschool through graduate school, because we were simply falling behind other countries in the areas of mathematics and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not talking only about producing good engineers and enough engineers, or good scientists and enough scientists. That is very important, and we must do it. We are losing out on that as well. But what we certainly have to do is to prepare everyone for the workplace of today, and especially the workplace of tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&#xBF;1530</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help do that. This bill builds on the Noyce Scholarship Program, an excellent program that has been in effect for a number of years and which was initially proposed by the former chair of the Science Committee, Sherry Boehlert. It is named after the person who helped to found Intel and make it grow into what it is today. They also have funded a number of scholarship programs, and this is our counterpart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this program does more than that. It strengthens and expands the  Noyce Scholarship Program, but it also strengthens and focuses the Math and Science Partnership Program at the National Science Foundation, a program which has fallen on hard times in the last few years, primarily because the President's budget has sought to eliminate funding for that program. I think this is based on a misunderstanding in the administration or in the Office of Management  and Budget about what the program does, and the mistaken belief that this program was a duplicate of one residing in the Department of Education. As a result the program in the Department of Education grew, and the one in the Science Foundation was cut back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact of the matter is they are both good programs and necessary programs, and they are complementary, not competitive. We need both if we are going to strengthen our teacher training programs. That is why I strongly approve of the aspect of the bill that will strengthen and focus the Math and Science Partnership Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also extends the authorization of and expands the NSF Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program, better known as the STEP program, which provides grants to colleges and universities to improve undergraduate science, math and engineering education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill enables NSF to fund the creation of centers at colleges and universities to develop new approaches to undergraduate education programs, and expands the focus of STEP beyond its initial focus of increasing the number of graduating STEM majors to also include increasing the number of nonmajors taking STEM courses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also establishes a pilot grant program at NSF to create a partnership to support science lab improvements in secondary schools, a proposal initiated by Mr. HINOJOSA in a separate bill, but that we are incorporating into this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, this bill does a great deal to strengthen several programs at the NSF and, develop innovative programs which will provide better math, science education at all levels from the elementary schools through the undergraduate and the graduate programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have worked together on this in a nonpartisan way. I commend Ranking Member HALL. Mr. HALL has been a strong person in this area and has strongly pushed this bill. I also commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. GORDON, who has also worked very hard on this. It has been a copacetic experience in the Science Committee to hear this discussion and see the progress we have made. I strongly support the bill, and urge the House to adopt it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to say amen to most of Dr. EHLERS' eloquent statement. He is a very constructive and positive force on our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda), a former science teacher.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in enthusiastic support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, and <bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill>, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Academies' report, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," found that the United States "must prepare with great urgency to preserve its strategic and economic security." To do this, we must compete by optimizing our knowledge-based resources, particularly in science and technology, and by sustaining the most fertile environment for new and revitalized industries and the well-paying jobs they bring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Representative from Silicon Valley, I am keenly aware of how innovation is a driving force behind our Nation's economy. There is one thread that runs through both bills that I particularly support, something I call teaching innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="363">H.R. 363</bill> authorizes the NSF to support research on the process of innovation and the teaching of inventiveness, while <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> enables the development and dissemination curriculum tools for teaching inventiveness and innovation. These provisions are derived from <bill type="h" number="1492">H.R. 1492</bill>, the Innovations for our Nation's Vital Educational Needs for Technology (INVENT) Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From talking to Silicon Valley CEOs, I have learned that, in especially innovative high-tech companies, the cutting-edge work has really been driven by a few highly innovative scientists and engineers who tend to have many patents, while other employees have only a few. To maximize our Nation's knowledge-based resources, I believe we need to figure out how these people do it and teach others those skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful to Chairman Gordon and also to the former chairman, Sherry Boehlert, with whom I worked on this during the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), a member of the Science Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>. Let me first congratulate Chairman Gordon for the leadership that he is providing, along with Ranking Member Hall, and let us note that since the change of the guard here in the House of Representatives a few months ago, we have had an exemplary approach to bipartisanship and a positive spirit that we have seen in the Science Committee, and this legislation reflects that positive atmosphere and working environment  that we have in the Science Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> seeks to address the lack of qualified teachers for math and science in K-12 throughout our country. I support <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> because it is not just a giving of something to someone, a scholarship, but it is actually providing young people who may not have the means to go to school and to get their education. It requires 5 years of service as a science and mathematics teacher in order for them to get this scholarship. I see that as a two-for, if not a three-for or a four-for, because the kids  are going to benefit, the schools are going to benefit, the country is going to benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trading service for education is an American tradition. I guess it goes back even further than the GI bill, but that is what brought it to mind. All of us had parents who were probably recipients of the GI bill. I know my father was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be beefing up education benefits through the GI bill and other things like that for our Reserves and our National Guard and Active Duty people, now that we are at war and now that we are thinking about this. But this particular scholarship program we are talking about today will fill a need for our country of finding math and science teachers in order to fill these positions throughout our country that now can't be filled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us note that 10,000 teachers provided these scholarships is certainly going to help. But the basic problem is not touched by this legislation, and that is that we would not need these scholarships if math and science teachers throughout the country were paid more than they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is happening is today, math and science teachers are being forced to accept wages, and then they don't accept them and just go someplace else, at the same level as teachers who teach things that are not quite as necessary. Or, in fact, there are many, many more teachers available for these other courses, whether it be social sciences or whatever. So since we do not have a pay differential, it is very difficult to fill these positions, and at least this legislation today will help meet the  immediate challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, however, we should have worked on the fundamental problem throughout our country of making sure that people can go into math and science and be attracted to it. Fundamentally, what we need to do in America to address these types of shortages is to make sure that people who go into math and science and engineering make more money, whether they are teachers or anything else. Quite often, we do things that go contrary to this. Insisting that all teachers make the same money is one of those  mistakes. H-1B visas that bring in hundreds of thousands of people from overseas and just depress the wages of people who are in math and science and engineering in our country is something else that is wrong, that ends up taking us in the wrong direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need our young people attracted to math, science and engineering, and to get that education because they know they can earn a good living for their family and earn a decent living if they get that type of training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the legislation we pass today will help. It will provide scholarships. I support that. I salute the chairman and the ranking member for the leadership they provided in providing this help for our young people in exchange for what they will do teaching young people in our country. But again, that doesn't change the fact that there are some fundamental things we need to do in America to make sure that people go into math and science and don't have to subsidize our mistaken policies.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairman Gordon, for giving me time to speak on this important and crucial piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to applaud you for your leadership on this issue, and the expediency that you moved this through committee, along with Ranking Member Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This initiative was identified by the Academies as being the most important step to increase America's talent pool by vastly improving K-12 science and mathematics education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the findings of the National Academies' "Gathering Storm" report, was a statistic that in 2000 more than 85 percent of students in grades 5-9 were taught physical science by a teacher lacking a major or certification in the physical sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former teacher, I can appreciate how difficult it is to teach a subject when you are not comfortable with it, and this discomfort translates in discomfort for the subject to the students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key to the United States maintaining its position at the forefront of global innovation and technology is to get more students interested in the science and math fields. Our Nation's economic vitality is derived in large part from the productivity of well-trained people and the steady stream of scientific and technical innovations they produce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After years of inattention and neglect, this legislation is an important first step towards a reinvestment in our Nation's science and math education. It will, in turn, positively benefit the American Competitive Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I applaud Chairman Gordon for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, it is a sad truth that American students' performance in science and math is below that of other developed countries. Like many of my colleagues, I am concerned that without increased attention to this issue at the elementary, high school and postsecondary levels, our country's technological leadership could decline and ultimately harm not only today's students but tomorrow's economy as well as our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides a framework for improving math and science education by investing heavily in the recruitment and training of teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, I have had the pleasure of observing several of the "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology," or FIRST Program's competitions. This program is designed to inspire young people to take an interest and participate in science and technology. Through FIRST, teams of students and their mentors work together to solve complex, real-world problems or design actual pieces of technology. They are given the opportunity to compete against their peers, all the while developing  self-confidence, good sportsmanship, and critical life skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The talent and drive of the students I have observed in the FIRST competitions leaves me encouraged--in fact, awestruck--by the potential of America's high school students. I have seen first hand that with quality resources and instruction, our children can do great things in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Today, our support for <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> is a tremendous step towards bringing these resources to future generations, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me thank Mr. Gordon, Mr. Hall, and our subcommittee chair as well as the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>. It is an essential measure to world competitiveness for this country. We are in the storm. We cannot accomplish rising above until we invest in our teachers, teachers that are qualified. Many of our teachers love teaching and they are trying hard, but they simply do not have the background needed. A lot of it has to do with pay, because the people who are well-qualified in these areas simply do not come to the classroom because they do not pay enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I support the Noyce teacher scholarships, and I know that the storm of need is sure and it is now. It takes efforts and investment to deal with this issue. There are now more and more high-need schools which means we have more and more students that need special attention, and we cannot have a positive future until we include them in this education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is called the investment in America's future. We are depending on the home people to be prepared because the H-1B visas are causing us to brain drain other countries. This is a global need, and we must be ready to prepare our own. We will be left with no possible preparation in this area, and we will move right into a Third World nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must remedy this. Implementing the provisions of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will go a long way in remedying this problem, and I firmly believe that with proper resources we know our young people can do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a school in my district with some of the poorest kids, but they are doing it because they have the proper resources.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I stand today with enthusiastic support for <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to add my thanks to Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their leadership on this issue and continued commitment of our entire Science and Technology Committee and the Research and Science Education Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I received a letter from a mother in New Jersey whose 14-year-old daughter was not satisfied with her education. This young girl wanted permission from her parents to move to Beijing, China, for high school because she felt like her counterparts were getting ahead of her education here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, this story underscores the need for our Nation to strengthen its investment in education, and it is consistent with the international statistics that we have seen of U.S. students falling behind in both the number of graduates and in academic performance with regard to science and math education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, America must make a major renewed commitment to education in math and science and engineering to promote innovation and technological advancement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As public servants, our constituents have entrusted us with the responsibility of ensuring our educators have the tools they need to best serve our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation to create a brighter future for our children, expanded support for our teachers, increased innovation in our research and technology, and a stronger competitive edge for the U.S. in the growing world marketplace.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400630" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, a bill that is critically important for America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Gordon for his hard work on this issue of science education and for making <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> a priority in this Congress. I also thank Representative Hall, ranking member of the committee, for his work on this bill and for his continuing work in a bipartisan manner in this committee to get things done that we need done for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous studies have shown that our students are falling behind the international curve on math and science. When I was a college professor, I certainly saw far too many students coming to college unprepared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we see that America is at a crossroads. The path that we choose will dictate our standing in the world for decades to come. If we continue business as usual, we jeopardize America's competitiveness and the prosperity that we have all come to enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, we must do all that we can to make sure that Americans are prepared by a world-class math and science education. America's high standard of living depends on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> is a vital part of an American innovation agenda that will help to guarantee a continued prosperity in America's future. Right now, many school districts throughout the country are finding it increasingly difficult to find good math and science teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyons Township High School Superintendent Dennis Kelly has spoken to me recently about the difficulties that they are having finding these teachers, and I hear this all across my district and all across the country. This bill targets this problem and offers viable solutions to recruiting new teachers, as well as developing and supporting current ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will expand the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation allowing more universities to be able to host programs for recruiting students into teaching. This is a vital part of our educational system, connecting universities with K-12 education. This will ensure that our children have an abundance of qualified, well-equipped math and science teachers who will prepare them for their future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a special understanding of the impact that teachers have on children's lives, especially when it comes to inspiring students in math and science. In addition to being a former college professor, I am only one of the handful of Members of Congress with a degree in engineering. In addition, my wife has a degree in math, and we often talk about the teachers who have inspired us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always remember my high school physics teacher, Father Fergus, who inspired me to pursue a degree in engineering, and I also will always remember Father Thul who really inspired me in mathematics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital that we pass this bill and continue to produce these teachers that continue to inspire our children and make our future more secure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to enthusiastically express my support for <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of this legislation is to improve our national corps of teachers in both math and science, both by recruiting new teachers and also by supporting the current ones. To build a world-class science and technology workforce, we need to have a world-class math and science education system, and <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will help accomplish this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Nation's report card in 2005, only 30 percent of eighth graders performed at or above the proficient levels in math. Only 32 percent of eighth graders and 18 percent of 12th graders performed at or above the proficient levels in science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America must do better. The National Academy's "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report, presented to us in committee, states that "without fundamental knowledge and skills, the majority of students scoring below proficient" levels will "lack the foundation for good jobs and full participation in society."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America must invest in this national teaching force, especially in rural and poor areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Karen Nicodemus is president of Cochise Community College in my district in Arizona. She states that although the shortage of high-quality and high-qualified math and science teachers cuts across all educational systems, we feel it in the rural areas more than in other areas. We do a disservice to our brightest students in high school in those rural and poor areas by not investing and making sure that we have a qualified workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To remain competitive in the 21st-century global economy, it is critical that we reform math and science education in America. All children, especially those in rural and in poor areas, should have the opportunity to become leaders, should be able to take our country to the next level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor to be on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, this body will take up two bills that represent a bipartisan effort to implement the recommendations in the watershed report, "Rising above the Gathering Storm."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their leadership in bringing these critical measures to us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will address our competitiveness crisis at its foundation, our acute shortage of teachers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, commonly known as the STEM fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Low-income, rural and minority communities bear a disproportionate share of the national shortfall of highly qualified STEM teachers. We must reverse that inequity. The 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Act will help us do exactly that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> also addresses a quiet crisis in our high-need high schools, the lack of quality laboratory science opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Research Council's report on America's high school labs found that experience in high school labs was poor for most students and practically nonexistent for students in low-income or minority communities. We will never produce enough STEM professionals if we do not address this issue and invest the correct amount of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that the legislation before us today includes the provisions of my bill, <bill type="h" number="524">H.R. 524</bill>, Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science Act. This legislation will establish a pilot program that will partner high-need school districts with colleges and universities and the private sector to improve high school laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through these pilot programs, we will be able to develop models and test effective practices for improving laboratory science in high-need schools. We will leverage resources from the local community and the private sector and build on our base of knowledge of what works in teaching science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would especially like to thank my friend and colleague, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), for working with me to move the PALS Act forward.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400271" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, our Nation's scientific and technological innovation has been a key source of our global economic competitiveness, but I fear that our competitiveness is in jeopardy because America's K-12 students are being underserved in math and sciences. If we do not provide our students with adequate education resources, we jeopardize our future economic prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds bill is a key step towards providing our students with the quality education needed to maintain our Nation's global competitiveness. We are facing a crisis in our schools because math and science college graduates are not being attracted to teaching careers. Too often, math and science teachers are instructing outside of their fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American students are facing a future of job competition on a global scale. In a global economy, highly educated workers from anywhere in the world can compete for America's high-skilled and high-paying jobs. To have a prosperous economy in which all segments of the population can compete for high-paying jobs, we need schools with well-placed labs and science programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will promote the educational experience that all our youth deserve, being taught by competent math and science teachers, and this bill will provide universities and teacher preparation programs the incentives to track more math and science college graduates and prepare them for their successful teaching careers. The bill will also increase professional development resources for math and science teachers already instructing in America's neediest schools.</paragraph>

I also would like to reiterate to Mr. Reyes that I, too, am sensitive to the needs of the high-needs schools. I think we have sufficiently addressed his concern in the underlying measure by providing an added incentive for Noyce scholars who choose to teach in high-needs schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the clearinghouse provided for under Mr. Gordon's amendment provides yet another layer of commitment to help guarantee that our high-needs schools are not left out of the selection process for the new STEM teachers.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me take just a moment to thank the staff, Jim Wilson, and our minority staff for the time they have put in on this bill. Two years ago, LAMAR ALEXANDER, and our former chairman, Sherry Boehlert, asked the National Academies to do a recommendation on the competitiveness of America in the 21st century. The recommendation was good news and bad news. The bad news was that we are in a very competitive environment and that we are on a losing track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good news was we had some recommendations. That is what we tried to do. We didn't try to make a Democratic or Republican bill; we took their recommendations and made a bipartisan bill. I think that today the bipartisan bill is the result of that. I again thank all the Members for their constructive efforts in doing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that the Speaker is so committed to this bill that she is on her way to the floor, and she is not only on her way, but she has arrived, and I yield her the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Science Committee and the ranking member for their leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor with strong bipartisan support. This is indeed a great day for the Congress because we are here to talk about the future. I always say to people when they come, You visit Washington, you see all these monuments to people who lived a long time ago; but when you come to the floor of the Congress, what  we are here to do is to make the future better for the next generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Central to that is a strong economy for our country. We have had a bipartisan commitment to an innovation agenda, a commitment to competitiveness to keep America number one. We know that innovation begins in the classroom, and that is why the legislation on the floor today is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some of us of a generation when I was a student, President Kennedy talked about putting a man on the Moon. It seemed impossible at the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he said it, when he made his announcement, he said the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we are first, and therefore we intend to be first. Our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves and others as well, all require us to make this effort. It was with that our country made a strong commitment to science and technology, and within 10 years a man was on the Moon and safely returned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we are again in this new century, all these many years later, recommitting to an innovation agenda. We have to talk about how we grow our economy to create new jobs here at home for the 21st century. We certainly have a commitment to trade, and that is important to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can only succeed in the international global economy if we are competitive and if we innovate. We cannot innovate without the investment in education, the investment in science and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our effort for an innovation agenda began nearly 2 years ago outside of Washington, meeting all over the country with leaders and CEOs in many fields, whether it was biotech, high-tech, the academic community, venture capital, entrepreneurs, young people and telecommunications sector people who are creating jobs for the 21st century. We held forums in Silicon Valley, in Seattle, and in Boston, in Chicago, northern New Jersey, North Carolina's Research Triangle, El Paso, Texas, to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Using the expertise and advice that we heard from the outside, emphasizing a focus on public/ private partnerships, emphasizing a focus on the entrepreneurial spirit that is the hallmark of our country, we adopted an innovation agenda that will help create a new generation of innovators, an educated skilled workforce in the vital areas of science, math, engineering and information technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairman Gordon, for your extraordinary leadership in this area and bringing this legislation to the floor. I also want to commend Chairman George Miller for his leadership and focusing on STEM as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agenda will help to make a sustained Federal research and development commitment that promotes private sector innovation, spur affordable access to broadband technology, achieve energy independence, strengthen our national security, protect our planet by developing emerging technologies for clean and sustainable alternatives, and provide small businesses with the tools they need to engage and encourage entrepreneurial innovation and job creation throughout our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what was important to us. Again, pointing out the importance of education to all of this, I am very pleased to come to the floor to support the legislation that is on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I want to thank Mr. Hall for his leadership in this area. I take special pride in the fact that this effort is bipartisan. The President has spoken on any number of occasions, in his State of the Union addresses or in other settings, about his commitment to this investment in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully we can move these pieces of legislation along to his desk for his signature and on to better public policy to promote the United States as  number one with an innovation agenda for the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a cosponsor of this important legislation, which will greatly increase the numbers of science and math teachers across the country, both through creating more teachers from current college students and by providing better training for the teachers already in our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has long been a center for science and engineering discovery. Just looking back over the 20th century, American ingenuity has been truly incredible. From Ford's Model T in 1908 and on to the personal computer in 1981, American innovations have transformed our Nation and the world, again and again, creating whole new industries and occupations. Going forward, new innovations will continue to be critical, both in maintaining a solid industrial base and increasing our standard of living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short--innovation leads to new products and processes that sustain our industrial base; innovation depends on a solid knowledge base in math, science and engineering; without this knowledge base, innovation as well as our industrial base will erode.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along those lines, all jobs of the future will require a basic understanding of math and science. The most recent 10 year employment projections by the U.S. Labor Department show that of the 20 fastest growing occupations projected for 2014, 15 require significant mathematics or science preparation to successfully compete for a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To succeed, U.S. students will need a strong background in math and science and our students have proven that they have talent in these areas. Compared to other countries, U.S. fourth graders score above average in both math and science on international tests. Yet, by the time these students graduate from high school, they score near the bottom of all industrialized countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do more to keep students involved, interested, and educated in science and math fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will help us increasing the number of well-trained science and math teachers, which will lead to more scientists and engineers in future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will enhance and expand the national corps of math and science teachers, both by recruiting new teachers with backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and by supporting current teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill will improve the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Noyce Scholarships will award $10,000 scholarships to students enrolled in STEM majors who commit several years to teaching. Furthermore, this program will ensure that these new teachers have mentors and other support as they begin teaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For current teachers, the bill will enhance NSF's Math Science Partnership (MSP) program, which provides sustained, content-oriented professional development for current teachers with summer institutes and master's degree programs. Furthermore, teachers participating in these MSPs are encouraged to become teacher leaders by sharing their knowledge with other teachers in their schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Science and Technology Chairman Gordon for introducing this critical legislation and working to bring it to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>. To ensure that we continue to have a strong and healthy economy in the new interconnected global market, we need to have a prosperous science and technology enterprise. This legislation will set us in the right direction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman GORDON, as well as Ranking Member HALL, on their hard work on this legislation, and the bipartisan manner in which the Science and Technology Committee operates to produce such substantial legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this legislation will come to the aid of America's need for more school teachers in our nation's classrooms. In their much referenced report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, the National Academies found that 68 percent of U.S. 8th grade students received instruction from a mathematics teacher who did not hold a degree or certification in mathematics; in 2000, more than 85 percent of students in grades 5-9 were taught physical science by a teacher lacking a major or certification  in the physical sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, U.S. 15-year-olds ranked 24th out of 40 countries that participated in a 2003 administration of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) examination, which assessed students' ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems. These figures could spell disaster for America's competitiveness in the fields of science, technology and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By amending and expanding the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) which will go to universities that build model programs for recruiting students into teaching, <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will move us down the road to improving the strength of our math and science teachers, while actively recruiting new teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our future lies in our students, and their ability to think critically, and ask thoughtful, insightful questions lie in the strength of their schooling. The un-bias nature of scientific inquiry and the natural beauty of math help students build their questioning and logic skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that our students are taught by teachers whose strengths lie in conveying these concepts and inspiring young minds not only to go into the science and technology fields, but also to open their minds to be inquisitive in the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today we are considering several bills to implement the Innovation Agenda including <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the "10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds" Science and Math Scholarship Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, I was pleased to support this legislation in Committee. <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> invests in thousands of new and highly qualified teachers through professional development, summer training institutes, scholarships, and investment in undergraduate science, technology, engineering and math ("STEM") education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I taught high school in Arizona for 28 years, and I know that my fellow teachers work hard and do a good job with the resources they have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I was also a State Senator for 8 years, and I know our schools need help. Arizona's students are below the national averages in every subject area. Arizona's teachers teach six children more per class than the national average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arizona must increase the number of highly qualified teachers and lower the student to teacher ratio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former educator, I understand first-hand the impact that education has on our children and their future. I appreciate Chairman GORDON's leadership on this issue, and I am pleased to see the chairman's legislation works to increase the number of qualified science and math teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring that our students receive a first-rate education is vital not only to Arizona's future but our nation's as well. I believe that if we want to successfully compete and prosper in the 21st century, we must make education a national priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Academy of Science was asked how the United States can accomplish this goal. Their report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, recommends action to recruit highly qualified science and math teachers and implement programs to strengthen the skills of our current teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wholeheartedly agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To continue to compete in the global economy we need to increase the number of science and technology graduates and our schools need the resources to successfully educate our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> supports this important goal and I look forward to supporting its passage today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, innovation in math, science, and technology is the way America will stay strong and competitive in this century. Unfortunately, we are seeing our children's test scores slip behind the rest of the industrialized world. In a recent exam to test the real-world application ability of mathematical concepts, U.S. high-school students ranked 24th out of 40 countries that were tested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mother and grandmother, I want all of our Nation's children to have the best possible education to empower them to be whatever they choose to be when they grow up. I can't help but be concerned with the idea that the America they will inherit will not be able to compete on the highest levels of the global marketplace. We must stem the tide of dropping test scores and fewer and fewer qualified teachers of science and math.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 minds, 10 million Science and Math Scholarship Act. It's not enough that we have the scientists to drive the innovation to keep us competitive. We also need to be producing the educators to mentor and impart wisdom to our youth so that they can expand their fields of knowledge, innovate new technologies, discover new medicines, and answer questions we once thought unanswerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a global economy, competition is going to keep increasing, and unless we take definitive action to increase our science and math capabilities, we are going to be left behind. <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, under the leadership of Chairman GORDON, is part of the definitive action we must take to get more qualified teachers in place to ensure that our kids have the knowledge and skills at hand to continue to lead the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> and to help put America on track to remain strong, competitive, and well-educated in math and science.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Ms. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the "10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act," of which I am proud to be a co-sponsor. This bill is the first component of the new Democratic majority's Innovation Agenda, which is designed to make our nation more able to compete successfully in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is essential that we invest in a workforce ready for global competition by creating a new generation of innovators and make a sustained commitment to federal research and development. We need to spur and expand affordable access to broadband, achieve energy independence, and provide small business with tools to encourage entrepreneurial innovation</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> is a critical first step. It will place highly qualified teachers in math, science, and technology K-12 classrooms, based on the recommendations of the National Academies. It will invest in 10,000 new science and math teachers, totaling some 25,000 over five years, by increasing the number of scholarships for students majoring in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields and who are committed to pursuing teaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, will also strengthen the skills of math, science and technology of up to 250,000 teachers by improving education and training opportunities for math and science teachers and expanding professional development, summer training institutes, and graduate education assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important, bipartisan legislation seeks to advance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, education by providing for improved recruitment, training, mentoring, and professional development of teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The establishment and maintenance of a capable scientific and technological workforce remains an important facet of U.S. efforts to maintain economic competitiveness. Pre-college instruction in mathematics and scientific fields is crucial to the development of U.S. scientific and technological personnel, as well as our overall scientific literacy as a nation. The value of education in scientific and mathematics is not limited to those students pursuing a degree in one of these fields, and even  students pursuing nonscientific and nonmathematical fields are likely to require basic knowledge in these subjects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, there is a need to extend access to mathematics and scientific education to a number of specific groups. Even as certain minorities, including African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, comprise an increasingly large proportion of the U.S. population, they continue to be underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines. Together, these three groups comprise over 25 percent of the population, but earn only 16.2 percent of the bachelor degrees, 10.7 percent of the  masters degrees, and 5.4 percent of the doctorate degrees in these fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation amends the National Science Foundation (NSF) Authorization Act of 2002 by revising the requirements for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program. This important program provides scholarships, stipends, and teacher training to science, mathematics, and engineering students and professionals, in exchange for a commitment to service as elementary or secondary school teachers following graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> also provides for summer institutes and graduate programs through the Mathematics and Science Education Partnership program. It authorizes $195 million from FY 2008 to FY 2012 for the operation of an already existing NSF program to provide summer workshops for teachers. It authorizes additional funds to establish a new grant program aimed at encouraging the development of graduate degree programs for math and science teachers. This bill provides increasing funding for fiscal years 2010  through 2012 for the NSF STEM Talent Expansion program, and authorizes the NSF to create pilot programs to award grants to improve laboratories in secondary schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, according to the National Academies, the most important thing we can do for our future economic health is invest in our science and math teachers. A number of highly publicized studies have shown that the mathematics and science achievement of American students is poor by international standards. In 2005, 39 percent of 12th graders lacked even basic high school math skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> has been endorsed by a broad range of businesses and universities as well as industry and education groups, including the Business Roundtable, Association of American Universities, Council on Competitiveness, the College Board, Semiconductor Industry Association and the Business Software Alliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. Taking its name from the fifth chapter of the National Academies Report "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> is part of an ambitious legislative portfolio that will fulfill the Innovation Agenda. I was proud to help craft the Innovation Agenda, on which our nation is dependent for its future prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In middle school, 68 percent of math students have a teacher who did not major in and has not certification in mathematics. Across all sciences, 57 percent of middle school students have teachers without a major or certification in the subject. In physical sciences, 93 percent have teachers without a major or certification. In high school, approximately 31 percent of math students, 45 percent of life science students, 61 percent of chemistry students, and 67 percent of physics students have teachers  with no major or certification in the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Science Foundation's successful Noyce program recruits and trains math and science teachers, drawing from high-performing college students and from existing math and science professionals. The Noyce program also encourages those it trains and supports to serve in high-needs school districts. <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> expands the Noyce program and modifies it to include freshmen and sophomores.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another successful math and science education program at the National Science Foundation is its Mathematics and Science Education Partnerships program, which provides grants to universities and nonprofits for the improvement of K-12 education. <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> improves the program by focusing grantees on teacher training, requiring grantees to offer masters programs for in-service teachers, and preparing teachers to instruct Advanced Placement courses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> does not stop with the improvement of these existing programs. It recognizes the special need for quality hands-on science teaching by authorizing funds for the Laboratory Science Teacher Professional Development program. The Act also requires the Director of NSF to convene a panel of experts to develop nationally available K-12 math and science teaching materials, and it creates centers that will work on curriculum, pedagogy, and the training of professors and teaching assistants to  increase undergraduate participation and performance in science, technology, engineering, and math courses.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is still the number one economy in the world, and we can keep that leadership. But we can only do so with a level of determination and commitment that we have not shown in almost half a century. Other countries are making aggressive investments in a competitive workforce. We must exceed those efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why--nearly 2 years ago--then-Minority Leader NANCY PELOSI laid down a challenge to Congress and the President to invest in innovation in order to create vibrant industries, a strong economy, and good jobs here at home. Now, with Speaker PELOSI at the helm and Democrats determining the agenda before Congress, we are acting on that challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working with leaders from the hi-tech and bio-tech industries, venture capitalists, and academics, Democrats laid out a plan to boost America's competitiveness. We made it clear to the American people that we take this challenge seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are taking the next steps on our commitment. The bill before the House today is an important step for America's future economic strength and the strength of America's middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. GORDON's legislation is a strong step in reaching a key goal of our innovation agenda. This bill will educate 25,000 highly qualified math and science teachers by creating high quality programs that integrate the strong teaching of both education programs as well as strong research and content area instruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Education and Labor Committee, we are also working to create a new generation of innovators by ensuring that today's students are taught to high academic standards and receive the workplace skills that are necessary to prepare them as scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in a global high-tech economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee will work toward the goals of innovation agenda by educating 100,000 new innovators in the next five years. We propose a new public-private partnership with the business community and higher education institutions to produce well-qualified, highly-skilled workers by establishing Congressional Science fellowships and interdisciplinary Master's programs in science, engineering, and math that include specialized training and internships with business partners, and loan forgiveness  options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, we will build on the work of Mr. GORDON by placing a highly qualified teacher in math, science, and technology K-12 classrooms by offering up-front tuition assistance to talented undergraduates majoring in math, science or engineering who agree to teach in a high-needs school and by partnering community colleges with 4-year institutions to improve the teacher pipeline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, we need to enhance the ability of states to coordinate education and workforce goals, identify the challenges of recruiting students and retaining them in innovative fields, and develop collaborative solutions through statewide coalitions of education, business, and community leaders, such as P-16+ Councils.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's entrepreneurial, innovative spirit is one of the key reasons for our strength in the world today. If we match that spirit to these substantial investments, our economy will stay strong for generations to come. I look forward to continuing to press forward with other elements of the Innovation Agenda and to make sure that America stays No. 1 in the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support these important bills--the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act and the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act--and to keep our Nation competitive in an era of global economic and scientific competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, more than ever, we must ensure that America remains at the forefront of discovery and innovation. To do that, we must engage our young people and encourage more of them to pursue careers in science, math, and engineering. These two bills accomplish that by fostering student potential in K-12 classrooms and by investing in long-term scientific research to keep more young scientists in our Nation's laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science Math Scholarship Act would increase the number of scholarships for students majoring in the field of science, technology, engineering, and math who want to teach and would strengthen the skills of current STEM teachers by expanding professional development. These teachers would be better equipped to excite and engage students in math and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act would increase our investment in long-term scientific research and provide grants to young researchers. It would encourage our brightest young minds to think innovatively and push the boundaries of current research. Also, it will encourage young scientists to continue their study in U.S. institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, these bills will help stimulate exciting research and increase the number of students entering the fields of math and science. They are an essential part of our competitiveness agenda, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for them today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation aims to increase the number of first-rate math and science teachers in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program targets two resources from which to recruit these teachers: one, undergraduates who are majoring in the math and science field; and, two,  science and math engineering professionals who want to switch to a teaching degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reported version of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> considerably expands the Noyce program. It also amends a part of the program that targets undergraduates. But the part of the program that targets professionals was left for the most part unchanged. This amendment establishes within the Noyce program a new model for recruiting professionals to a teaching career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new model is based on a program called Math for America, which has shown astonishing success in making first-rate teachers out of former scientists and engineers. Math for America was launched in 2004 by James Simons, a mathematician who founded an enormously successful private investment firm in New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Simon's philanthropic foundation has provided much of the funding for Math for America. This is just the third year of Math for America, but already they have recruited 90 teachers for New York City public schools. The math for America model has so much in common with the Noyce program at the National Science Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consistent with the Math for America model, my amendment has the following features: An institution of higher education wishing to establish this new program must create a partnership with at least one non-Federal entity to be eligible for the NSF support; a scientist or engineer participating in the program must demonstrate advance content knowledge through a nationally recognized standardized test; participants take specialized education courses in a 16-month teacher certification program during  which they receive a stipend; graduates from the program must teach in a secondary school for a period of 4 years, during which they receive a teaching supplement to their ordinary salary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The teaching supplements are provided by the partnerships from non-Federal sources. This amendment, therefore, adds a component to the Noyce program to develop the kind of public/private partnership that we see working so well in Math for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the chairman's amendment. I know on this bill, <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, this is a perfect example of everything being said but not every one of us having an opportunity to say it. I rise in support of the amendment of Chairman Gordon and also the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't improve on the words of the distinguished Speaker that we heard from just a few minutes ago, but I do want to applaud and support this <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, 10,000 Teachers, 10,000 Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, and certainly applaud Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall and the work that they have done. I am proud to be a member of the Science and Technology Committee and to see this come to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The National Academy released a report, Mr. Chairman, entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" that looked at the ways in which the Federal Government could enhance our country's science and technology enterprise so that we can continue to compete and prosper in the global marketplace. The commission arrived at one outstanding and alarming conclusion: American students are falling behind in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math, sometimes referred to as STEM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to this sobering reality, the report recommends vastly improving the K-12 science and math programs in classrooms across the country in order to increase America's talent pool. We talk about raising the level of H-1B visas, doubling them. That might be part of the solution, Mr. Chairman, but we need to develop our homegrown talent. Early education is crucial in getting children not only excited about math and science, but adequately prepared to pursue these fields later in life. And  I strongly believe by recruiting, retaining, and training better educators in these fields more students will want to attend college in the areas of science, technology, and math. And that is the key to keeping America competitive in the ever-increasing technological global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship program begins to remedy this situation by implementing a variety of action items recommended by this report. First, <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> seeks to raise both the quantity and quality of math and science teachers in America by increasing the number and amount of grants available to teachers and students who pursue continuing education in these fields. It also increases grants within a program at the National Science Foundation that provides  financial aid to students who make a commitment to teach after college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I firmly believe this legislation is a good first step to address this impending crisis of America's workforce. I am again proud to support the bill, to support Chairman Gordon's amendment. I respectfully ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I certainly from a policy standpoint don't have an issue with the amendment; in fact, I think it might go a long way in enticing retired STEM professionals to get their teacher's certification and to put their many years of expertise to work in the K-12 classroom, educating and inspiring our next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. I support the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400155" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Noyce program at the National Science Foundation has up to now required scholarship recipients to teach in high-need schools. <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> substantially expands the program, scaling it up from fewer than 1,000 pre-service STEM teachers per year to 10,000 per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Noyce program is being scaled up by <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> to address the needs of schools in all parts of the Nation which have large numbers of out-of-field STEM teachers. For example, the percentage of physical science teachers in  middle schools with neither a major in the field nor certification is nearly 90 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of enlarging the program's scale, the bill also removes the requirement that all graduates teach in a high-need school. But the bill also adds in its place an incentive for teachers to serve in high-need schools. The amendment I am proposing makes clear that we are not backing away from our firm commitment to address the requirements of high-need schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment has two provisions. The first provision requires the NSF to broadly disseminate information about the program, including to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. This is to ensure that students in minority schools have improved chances of seeing a minority teacher prepared through a Noyce program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision requires the foundation to maintain a clearinghouse on teaching opportunities in high-need schools. This will assist Noyce scholars in finding their ideal placement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this amendment, Noyce scholars seeking placement might not know which schools meet the definition of high-need in any given year or which such schools have openings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will both help increase the number of individuals from minority-serving institutions who participate in the Noyce program and will help recruit Noyce scholars to teaching positions in high-need schools. I recommend adoption of this amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I do support this amendment and I think we should approve it, but I would like to spend the majority of my time discussing the previous amendment which we already accepted. I would like to make a point in connection with that. A very good part of that amendment is that it provides an additional stipend for teachers during their 4-year service requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a major problem in America with math and science teachers; in fact, we have a major problem with a lot of teachers who do not stick with their field. We just don't have the retention rate we should. But that is especially true of good math and science teachers because the market out there for them is tremendous. Frequently, they can double their salary by going into industry, and at the very least they can increase their salary by 40 or 50 percent. It is very difficult for the schools  to compete with that, although I have argued for years we should have a salary differential for those teachers who have very strong economic incentives to leave the teaching profession and to go into another job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We simply have to meet the market, and unfortunately that has not been the tradition in the schools. I think we should establish that. If you don't meet the market, you are going to lose your best teachers, and we certainly don't want to lose them after all the work we have done through these various scholarships to develop good teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I strongly support the part of the Noyce amendment No. 2 which Chairman Gordon offered, and I hope that we can work, not just within this Congress but within this Nation, with the teachers, the school boards, and the teachers unions to develop a system that recognizes that a mechanism is needed to meet the market for those teachers who are offered large inducements to leave the teaching profession and go to another field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply wanted to make that point in connection with the first amendment simply because that amendment is a start in the right direction, and I hope we can carry that principle onward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Chairman Gordon offering the amendment, and I hope that we can continue along that path in future bills relating to the subject.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Tennessee reserves a point of order.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit with instructions. My motion to recommit addresses a glaring inconsistency in this bill with all other Federal education laws by removing a provision that moves us in the direction of national standards and curriculum and puts those decisions back in the hands where they belong, in the hands of our State and local education leaders and, most importantly, parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education in this country has always been predominantly a State and local issue, and within that context parents had a protected right to direct their children's education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in the years after the passage of No Child Left Behind, the Federal contribution towards educating our children continues to be less than 10 percent, with States, counties, cities, and towns, actually parents and their local communities, providing over 90 percent of their funding to educate the next generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not only appropriate but imperative that the Federal law prevents the Federal Government from telling States and districts and schools what and how they should teach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the No Child Left Behind Act prohibits the Federal Government from mandating, directing, reviewing, or controlling a State, district, or school's choice of instructional content or curriculum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, No Child Left Behind strictly prohibits the Department of Education from endorsing, approving, or sanctioning any curriculum for an elementary or secondary school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rationale behind these provisions is important. As a Nation, we believe that the people closest to our children should make the decision as to what works best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Children learn differently. Some are visual learners. Some learn best from listening. Others need hands-on opportunities. While there are some things that work well for some groups of children, determining definitively what works at the national level for all children is absurd. Therefore, when the Federal Government says that these five, 10 or 15 specific science curricula are most effective, it is implicitly telling States, districts and schools that they should use these identified options,  irrespective of whether that is what is best for their students or their area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Case in point is the current debate regarding the implementation of Reading First. There are allegations that some States and districts took information from technical assistance center employees and, to be fair, some department employees, to be implied endorsements of specific programs, believing that those were the only programs that would be funded under Reading First.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one seems happy about the outcome, yet this underlying bill would create another panel to provide "recommendations" that it then requires the Director of NSF and the Secretary of Education to disseminate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take a look at this motion to recommit. Very simple. Nothing in this act or the amendments made by this act shall be construed to limit the authority of State governments or local school boards to determine the curricula of their students. It very clearly states and adds the clarifying language that it is the State and local school districts' responsibility and accountability for developing and approving the most appropriate, the most effective teaching methods and the most effective content.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress has long taken the position that we do not want to develop national curriculum and national standards. This Congress has consistently taken the position that we need and want local control of our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to recommit, to once again say that parents and local school districts, the ones who know the needs and the names of our children in their schools, are the ones in the best position to make the decisions as to what will happen in the classrooms in their local schools.</paragraph>
