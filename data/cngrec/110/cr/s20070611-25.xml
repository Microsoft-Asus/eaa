  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. On June 29-July 1, the residents of Noonan will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Noonan is a thriving rural community in northwest North Dakota that shares a border with the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Noonan holds an important place in North Dakota's history. Like many of the rural communities in North Dakota, Noonan began its history as a community with the arrival of the Great Northern Railroad. Noonan received its name from Patrick Noonan, the first mayor of Noonan. The first businesses in Noonan included the Golden Rule General Store, an implement store, and a  hotel. Noonan officially became a city on September 14, 1928.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the community of Noonan is largely based on agriculture and is home to some of the best waterfowl and upland game hunting in northwest North Dakota. There is also a volunteer fire department and EMT service, two taverns, and many other businesses in this close-knit community where everyone knows everyone. The nearby Noonan trout pond offers camping and fishing. Noonan is also home to a prominent Lions Club chapter, which is the oldest service organization in Noonan and whose main goal  is to help the blind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community of Noonan is a wonderful place for its residents to live, work, and raise future generations. The people of Noonan take pride in their community and all the opportunities it has to offer. The town has an exciting centennial weekend planned that includes dances, a parade, variety show, a Sunday brunch, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Noonan, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the next century. By honoring Noonan and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Noonan that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Noonan has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
