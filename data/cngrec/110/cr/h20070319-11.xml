    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we stand here today, the Iraqi people enjoy a freedom and sense of self-government they were not afforded 4 years ago. Since the United States originally liberated the Iraqis, they have established a democracy, ratified a constitution, and elected a representative government. Such rights were denied under the totalitarian regime of Saddam Hussein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General David Petraeus, the new commander of coalition forces in Iraq, is an expert in fighting insurgencies by murderers who defy laws of war. Our military officials have made necessary adjustments, and we are seeing signs of progress. Cutting funding, limiting reinforcements and setting artificial timetables only serve to undermine this end. Together, as Democrats and Republicans, we must achieve victory in Iraq to achieve victory in the global war on terrorism to protect American families.  We must face the terrorists overseas, or we will face them again in the streets of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
