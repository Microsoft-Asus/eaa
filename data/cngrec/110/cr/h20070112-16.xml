  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to fully support SAFE TEA-LU funding at its authorized level for fiscal year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If, as expected, the House passes a joint resolution extending funding for government programs through October 1, it is important that we allow the highway funds to increase from the 2006 level to the authorized 2007 level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal highway funding is very important to all States, and my State of West Virginia is no exception. Significant progress is being made on construction of a new four-lane U.S. 35 and on Corridor H, and transportation improvements are needed across everyone's district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping highway funding steady at the 2006 level would stop a scheduled $3.4 billion increase that State highway departments, workers and motorists have planned on and expected for this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's fiscal year 2007 budget, the House-passed transportation appropriation bill and the Senate appropriation bill called for $39.1 billion for highway construction. Failing to allow an increase would cost West Virginia $57.7 million, and 2,740 construction jobs.</paragraph>
