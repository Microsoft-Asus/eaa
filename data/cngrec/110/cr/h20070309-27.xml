    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday we resumed reading the names of our servicemembers on this House floor that have paid the ultimate sacrifice in this war. To date, 3,188 American servicemembers have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I am greatly saddened today to add the name of Specialist Blake Harris to that list of the fallen soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Harris was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Harris died on Monday, March 5, in Baqubah, Iraq, of injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Blake Harris was born and raised in Pueblo, Colorado. He was a 2002 graduate of Pueblo South High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Pueblo, Blake leaves behind a loving wife, Joanna; a 2-year-old son, Jonah; and his mother, Deborah Harris. He is also survived by his father, John Harris of Denver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I extend my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his family and friends who have suffered this loss, and I pray for their comfort and strength in their time of greatest need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Harris was a proud and courageous soldier whose story must never be forgotten. Blake Harris was 22 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I submit this recognition to the United States House of Representatives in honor of his sacrifice so that the memory of Blake Harris may live on forever.</paragraph>
