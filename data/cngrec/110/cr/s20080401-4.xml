    <paragraph>Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, if he chooses to make remarks, there will be a period of morning business until 12:30 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for our normal weekly caucus luncheons. Following the recess, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, which is the housing bill. At approximately 2:30 p.m., the Senate will  proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to this legislation. The last 15 minutes is set aside for the two leaders, and if we choose to use that time, that is equally divided. The vote will occur, as I have indicated, at 2:30 this afternoon.</paragraph>
