    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush said last week al Qaeda in Iraq attacked us on 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is there was no al Qaeda in Iraq on 9/11. In fact, we helped create al Qaeda in Iraq by our invasion. And what we are going to learn today from our intelligence service report is 4 years in Iraq has made al Qaeda stronger around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's get our facts straight in this war and focus on the real threat in a smart and intelligent way.</paragraph>
