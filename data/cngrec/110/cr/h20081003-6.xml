  <narrative>SAME DEEPLY FLAWED PLAN -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10701]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is, at its core, the same deeply flawed Bush-Paulson plan. Borrow $700 billion in the name of the American taxpayer, give Paulson unrestrained, unprecedented authority to buy anything he deems a troubled asset from anyone at any price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What if there's a credible, low cost, low-risk alternative? I heard such a plan again last night from the head banking regulator under the Reagan administration, William Isaac: Use the emergency powers of the FDIC. Extend the same insurance given to Wachovia to the depositors and creditors of all banks. That would immediately free up interbank lending and credit. Granted, it doesn't solve the problem of the Wall Street speculators, but it does solve the problem of loans for business and Main  Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years ago this month, Congress was stampeded by this President into an unnecessary and unprecedented authorization of force for war in Iraq under the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Do not repeat that mistake by authorizing George Bush an unprecedented use of financial force under the threat of financial weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
