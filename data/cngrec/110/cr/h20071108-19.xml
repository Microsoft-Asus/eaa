    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, several States held elections this week, and now the 2008 Presidential elections are just 1 year away. This is a good time to reflect on the importance of voting and the integrity of our election process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The right to vote is one of the most important freedoms granted to citizens in the United States. It's a right and a privilege that should not be taken lightly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our voter registration process needs to be reformed in order to ensure that only American citizens are eligible to vote. It is alarming that eight of the &#xD0;9/11 hijackers were registered to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sanctity of the ballot box must be paramount. If we can't ensure the integrity of our elections, our representative form of government breaks down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a person gets a driver's license, they can check a box to register to vote, and there's no guarantee that the person's eligibility to vote will be verified. There are House seats that have been decided by just a few votes per precinct. The American people deserve to know that elections will be won and lost by legal, rightfully registered voters.</paragraph>
