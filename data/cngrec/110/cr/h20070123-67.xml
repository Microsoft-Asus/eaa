  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today in Lebanon, protesters are rioting, burning tires and cars, and crippling Beirut to oppose the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Saniora.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of the opposition comes from Hezbollah and its supporters seeking more influence in Lebanon's government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, one of our close allies is forced to watch these riots as a recurring threat is building on its borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last summer we watched as the terrorist group Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers and killed eight others and began firing missiles into Israeli cities intentionally targeting civilian populations and infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This group was supplied by Syria and Iran for years, and built up stockpiles of weapons after Israel completely withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Israel responded in self-defense and launched an offensive in southern Lebanon to destroy the weapons caches and Hezbollah's bunkers. Fortunately, the Israeli Air Force was able to destroy many of the longer range rockets Hezbollah possessed, but thousands of shorter-range rockets were indiscriminately fired at Israeli towns and villages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 2 months of fighting, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 was passed. Among other things, 1701 called for a U.N. peacekeeping force of up to 50,000 troops to assist the Lebanese military to prevent Hezbollah's resurgence and rearmament in southern Lebanon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, these troops have not stopped Syria and Iran from rearming Hezbollah, and Israel must watch as this threat is re-emerging just miles from its border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit for the RECORD this recent article that appeared in Jane's Defence Weekly. It details some of the problems Lebanese and U.N. forces are having stopping the movement of weapons across the Syrian-Lebanese border. What is clear from this article, and numerous other reports, is that Hezbollah is rearming and gaining autonomy again in southern Lebanon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week in an interview, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, promised that Hezbollah would intensify its campaign to bring down the Lebanese Government in the coming days and weeks. Israel and the United States cannot let this happen, and we must support Israel's right to defend itself before its civilians are indiscriminately attacked once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, we have watched as Israel has made unilateral concessions, withdrawing from Lebanon in 2000 and withdrawing from Gaza in 2005, and each concession has resulted in growing threats on its borders and attacks on its soldiers and citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After entering southern Lebanon to battle Hezbollah militants last summer, Israel again withdrew under United Nations Resolution 1701, passed sending international troops to southern Lebanon with the promise that the international troops would assist Lebanon's military to prevent Hezbollah from rearming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the promises of security made to Israel by the international community have not been fulfilled and Hezbollah is getting stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and the international community to join me in looking for a solution to this situation. As a close ally, we should ensure Israel's hands are not tied while this threat builds on its border, and we should address this growing problem before Hezbollah again decides to attack Israeli soldiers and civilians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iran Replenishes Hizbullah's Arms Inventory</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some five months after UN Resolution 1701 halted the conflict in south Lebanon between Israel and the Islamic Resistance--the armed wing of Shi'ite Party of God (Hizbullah), Iran has replenished Hizbullah's depleted stocks of surface-to-surface rockets and anti-tank guided weapons (ATGWs).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to the onset of the conflict on 12 July, Western intelligence agencies estimated that Hizbullah had amassed an inventory of some 12,000 rockets of various calibres. During the conflict the Islamic Resistance expended about 4,000 rockets, while its longer-range systems, namely the Iranian- supplied 50 km range Fajr-3, the 70 km range Fajr-S, the 125 km-range Zelzal 1 and 210 km-range Zelzal 2 rocket systems were not employed, having sustained considerable  damage as a result of Israel Air Force (IAF) strikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hizbullah emerged from the conflict strategically weaker, and, with the implementation of Resolution 1701, lost its autonomy in south Lebanon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Western defence source told Jane's that Iran, with Syrian compliance, has now ramped up deliveries of rockets, ATGWs and other advanced systems in "an effort to rehabilitate Hizbullah's military strength and status".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying message here is one of "unfinished business" or preparation for a second stage of operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ali Akbar Mohtashemi Pour, Iran's former ambassador to Syria and one of the main forces behind the foundation of Hizbullah, confirmed on 1 November in an interview with the AKI news agency that Tehran had begun restocking Hizbullah with weapons. Later, on 6 November, Mohtashemi Pour noted that Tehran had "started to re-arm  Hizbullah for all its needs".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The extent of this commitment was borne out in a speech by Hizbullah Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah at the Divine Victory Rally in Beirut on 22 September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The resistance today has more than 20,000 rockets. The resistance is today stronger than on July 12 and stronger than ever before," he said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these numbers have yet to be independently confirmed, the source noted that the Iranian unit charged with liaising with Hizbullah, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) "Qods Force"--currently headed by IRGC Brigadier General Kazem Soleimani--has, since the end of the conflict, significantly stepped up the transfer of war materiel, along with funding, training and intelligence on Israel, to the Islamic Resistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of this weapons supply has been facilitated by the compliance of Damascus in smuggling weapons across its borders, the source claimed. "While Iran is the key weapon supplier, Syria was, and still is, the dominant if not exclusive channel for weapons transfer to Hizbullah. This operation is led by Syrian military officers in co-operation with senior IRGC officials in Iran and Syria," the source added.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, most of the rockets fired on Israel during the conflict were Syrian made and the majority of ATGW deployed by Hizbullah were Russian made, acquired and supplied by Syria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terje Roed-Larsen, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for the Implementation of Security Council Resolution 1559, announced on 31 October that he had received reports from Lebanese government officials of "extensive weapons smuggling into Lebanon".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an unprecedented step, the Lebanese armed forces have deployed over 8,000 troops along the 265 km Lebanon-Syria border to counter these activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While they have managed limited successes, "the length of the border and the forces allocated for the mission by the government are insufficient", the sources said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Moreover, because of the sensitivity of the issue and the considerable concern over Hizbullah's military strength--where the Lebanese forces do not want to openly confront Hizbullah--the general trend is to turn a blind eye toward the border activity and to detect and cover up exposed weapon smuggling incidents as quickly as possible," the source said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, 19 vessels of the reinforced UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL-2) are patrolling Lebanese waters and inspecting ships approaching the country to prevent maritime smuggling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Western diplomatic source told Jane's that the Islamic Resistance--citing lessons learned in the early stages of the conflict where it lacked the means to contend with IAF operations--has specifically pressured Iran for "an array of more advanced weaponry, including surface-to-air missile [SAM] systems."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The source said that "following the supply of an undisclosed quantity of Iranian-made Noor [reverse-engineered Chinese C802/YJ-2] radar-guided anti-ship cruise missiles and Chinese QW-1 [Vanguard] shoulder-launched SAMs", Iran has agreed to supply advanced Russian-made SAM systems to Hizbullah as part of its strategy to transform Hizbullah "into a coherent fighting force and a regional strategic arm".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The source added that Tehran will supply Hizbullah with Russian-produced SAMs, including the Strela-2/2M (SA-7 "Grail"), Strela-3 (SA-14 "Gremlin") and Ilgla-lE (SA-16 "Gimlet") man-portable SAMs. Iran is also understood to have agreed to deliver its own version of the Chinese QW-l man-portable low- to very-low-altitude SAM system--the Mithaq-l--developed by the Iranian Defence Ministry's Shahid Kazemi Industrial Complex in Tehran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iran has, in the interim, set out to restock Hizbullah's inventory of 122 mm Grad-series Katyusha rockets, 240 mm Fajr-3 and 333 mm Fajr-5 rockets, truck-mounted Falaq-l and Falaq-2 truck-mounted multiple-launch rockets systems, RAAD-T and Toophan ATGWs and Nader improved rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), the source said. However, to date there is no evidence that Tehran is replenishing Hizbullah's Zelzal-series longer-range rockets, although sources suggest these could still be smuggled in separate  component packages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Syria, the source said, continues to resupply Hizbullah with 220 mm and 302 mm rockets (dubbed Raad and Khaibar-l (M302 by the IDF) respectively); Kornet-E, Metis-M and Konkurs ATGWs; and RPG-29 tandem-warhead RPGs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These moves come despite offers to Israel from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on 19 December to crack down on Hizbullah and the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in exchange for a return to negotiations.</paragraph>
