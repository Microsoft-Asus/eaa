  <narrative>MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE AUGUSTUS FREEMAN (GUS) HAWKINS OF CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13875]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is often as the dean of the California delegation a sad duty to report the passing of a colleague, but I have to say today that I want to announce and celebrate with you the life of a distinguished former colleague who died last Saturday at 100 years of age. Augustus Freeman Hawkins had a 28-year career in this body, and I just briefly want to celebrate with you the accomplishments of this gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gus, as we all knew him, was born in Shreveport, Louisiana on August 31, 1907, about the same time my dad was born in California. He moved to Los Angeles. He was elected to the State assembly in 1935. He was elected to Congress in 1962, and served here 28 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During that 28-year service, he chaired the House Administration Committee, he chaired the Committee on Education and Labor, a whole host of joint committees, Printing, the Library Committee, and decided not to run for reelection in 1990. But among his many accomplishments, and Gus authored more than 300 State and Federal laws in his career, but what he will be most known for, I think, is authoring title VII of the Civil Rights Act which created the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He sponsored and was noted and will be remembered most perhaps for the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act that he sponsored with Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to pay tribute to one of the great careers of one of our great colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from California.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate very much my colleague yielding, and I rise also to pay tribute to one of the great Americans who provided a level of leadership in terms of public policy in this House like few have and most would want to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gus was a wonderful friend over time, and his best roommate, a guy by the name of Frank Baca served us in and around the Vatican for some years, a wonderful guy as well. They lived a short distance from our house. My bride and I used to walk in the park and run into Gus often. The conversations were about the House first, briefly, but then from there the fact that the best thing about this place, if we will let it, it is a place where people of great difference can become very dear and warm friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gus Hawkins was one of the great Americans to ever serve in the Congress. While he has passed, it is a tribute to America that we can have men and women in the House of Representatives of the style and class of Gus Hawkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate my colleague yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am glad to yield to the gentleman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman, and I thank him for taking this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one who had the honor of serving under Gus Hawkins when he was Chair of the Education and Labor Committee, I would just like to say to my colleague that this was a man of great vision for young people, for students, and for working families. I knew Gus long before I came to the Congress. I knew him as a young man when he and my father served together in the State legislature and they were engaged in the great civil rights battles at that time, the great battles over education and school quality.  Gus died when he was 100, but he was thinking about things 120 years from now because that's the way he always was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gus was always looking over the horizon for new opportunities and new ideas and new ways of doing things. He was a great pioneer, but he was also a great visionary and he honored us with his service in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for taking this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to yield, if I may, to the gentlewoman from California who now represents the district that our friend Gus Hawkins represented.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to join with the head of our delegation, Representative Stark, and others, in paying tribute to an extraordinary man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gus Hawkins was one of the most profound public policymakers that ever served in this House. You heard PETE STARK allude to some of that legislation. That legislation has been good for America, it's been good for African Americans, it's been good for this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so proud that when Gus Hawkins decided that he was not going to stand for reelection in 1990, he called me and he said, "I'm calling you first because I believe that you would do well representing this district by serving as a Member of Congress." And so I have tried to live up to his legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gus Hawkins, however, was very, very strong. He understood how government works. He was understated. He got along with everybody. He made a lot of friends in this House. And people responded to him in a terrific manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I am standing here in great sympathy and in pain, because I know that we wanted to get him up here one more time when we focused on the Hawkins-Humphrey Act with BARNEY FRANK in the Financial Services Committee. We were not able to do that. And so all that we can do now is honor him with this tribute and say, "Rest well, Gus."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would request a moment of silence, please, before we resume our schedule.</paragraph>
