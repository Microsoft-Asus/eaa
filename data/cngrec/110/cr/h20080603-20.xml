    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration <bill type="hr" number="1114">H. Res. 1114</bill>, which expresses the support of Congress for the environmental goals and ideals of Arbor Day and the work of the Arbor Day Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1114">H. Res. 1114</bill>, which was introduced by my colleague, Representative Jeff Fortenberry, on April 16, 2008, was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2008 by voice vote. This measure has the support and sponsorship of 53 Members of Congress, and recognizes the importance of Arbor Day and the Arbor Day Foundation in preserving America's green spaces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>J. Sterling Morton, the father of Arbor Day, once observed that, "The cultivation of trees is the cultivation of the good, the beautiful, and the ennobling in man." Established in 1872 as a tree planting holiday and celebration, Arbor Day has had a powerful and positive effect on America's landscape and ecosystem, and is now observed both nationally as well as in many foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we can't speak about National Arbor Day without mentioning the work of the National Arbor Day Foundation which was created with a mission to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees. The Foundation has attracted almost 1 million members to become passionate about conservation and is worthy to be commemorated for their efforts to distribute 10 million plus trees annually for planting. And so I ask, Mr. Speaker, that we show our support of Arbor Day and the Arbor Day Foundation  by agreeing to <bill type="hr" number="1114">H. Res. 1114</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague from the State of Nebraska, the author of this resolution, Mr. Fortenberry.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400640" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, J. Sterling Morton, the founder of Arbor Day and an outstanding Nebraskan, once said, "Each generation of humanity takes the earth as trustees." That is the spirit embodied in Arbor Day. The simple act of planting a tree provides resources  and beauty for future generations, and engages in good environmental stewardship. This resolution supports the goals of National Arbor Day and the National Arbor Day Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to begin by expressing my sincere appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), the chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, and Mr. Clyburn of South Carolina for his help today, and the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis), the ranking member of the committee, for their help in bringing this important resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bit of history on Arbor Day. J. Sterling Morton served as United States Secretary of Agriculture, and is honored as one of two Nebraskans to have a statue in the United States Capitol. His former home, Arbor Lodge in Nebraska City, is now the centerpiece of a truly magnificent State historical park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An early pioneer to the Nebraska territory, he first proposed Arbor Day in 1872 to address the absence of trees in Nebraska. Trees were needed to produce fuel and building materials, provide the necessary shade and wind breaks, as well as to prevent soil erosion. It is estimated that Nebraskans planted more than 1 million trees during that first Arbor Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before long, the idea spread. Arbor Day is now celebrated in all 50 States and in many Nations throughout the world. Although National Arbor Day is always the last Friday in April, individual States observe Arbor Day on various dates, according to the most appropriate tree planting times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another outstanding Nebraskan, John Rosenow, built upon that legacy. In 1972, he established the National Arbor Day Foundation. Its mission is to "inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees." Through its Trees for America program, it distributes more than 8 million trees annually. The Foundation has worked with the United States Department of Agriculture's forest service since 1990, helping to plant nearly 4 million trees in national forests that have been damaged by fire, insects,  or other natural causes. The Foundation has also branched out beyond the United States borders, promoting environmental activities throughout the world, including rainforest preservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is very appropriate that we honor Arbor Day and its vision of dedication to tree planting. We should also recognize the countless individuals in our country who have planted trees in fulfillment of this important vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>J. Sterling Morton once also said, "Other holidays repose on the past. Arbor Day proposes for the future." By supporting this resolution, we honor the spirit of Arbor Day. Planting trees is about planting for the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1114">H. Res. 1114</bill>, supporting the goals and ideals of the Arbor Day Foundation and National Arbor Day. I wholeheartedly support the planting as well as the management of healthy trees and forests. The Forest Service has estimated that a healthy and well managed forest could sequester much more of our national carbon emissions than our forests currently sequester, currently sequestering an estimated 10 percent of our national carbon emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this resolution. I also rise to urge my colleagues to address other issues facing our Nation, especially rising fuel prices. Increasing the supply of crude oil and ultimately its price is the single most effective thing Congress can do to lower gas prices. Today, 73 percent of every dollar we pay for gasoline is the price of producing crude oil. And yet, according to a study just released by the Bureau of Land Management, while onshore public lands in the United States are  estimated to contain 31 billion barrels of oil and 231 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, some 60 percent of these lands are completely closed to leasing. Congress must act to lift the restrictions on America's energy rich public lands and increase exploration for and production of American crude oil and natural gas, and do so in an environmentally friendly manner.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Nebraska for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded that my mother was a serious conservationist who just loved the beauty of flowers and trees. I would urge passage of this resolution as I close by remembering the words of Joyce Kilmer who had a poem called "Trees." He said that:</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution honoring the goals and ideals of the Arbor Day Foundation and National Arbor Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trees--They provide us with shelter and warmth. They clean the air we breathe. Their majesty inspires awe and alters landscapes. Mankind owes its livelihood to these miracles of nature, yet it is so easy to overlook their importance and beauty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These traits were not lost to J. Sterling Morton, a pioneer who moved from Detroit to the unforgiving, treeless plains of the Nebraska Territory in 1854. A journalist and avid lover of nature, Morton used his position as editor of Nebraska's first newspaper to spread agricultural information and his enthusiasm for trees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His words did not fall on deaf ears. Fellow pioneers soon realized how valuable trees were to their survival, not only for fuel and building materials, but for the stability of the soil and shade from the arid sun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once appointed as the secretary of the Nebraska Territory, on January 4, 1872 Morton first proposed a tree-planting holiday called "Arbor Day." That same year, on April 10, citizens across Nebraska planted over one million trees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first official Arbor Day was held on April 10, 1874 and by 1885 it became a legal holiday in Nebraska to be celebrated on April 22, J. Sterling Morton's birthday. Throughout the 1870's the appeal spread across the nation and it was not long before Arbor Day was celebrated in each state of the United. States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Arbor Day is observed not only throughout this great nation, but across the globe. While most states observe Arbor Day on the last Friday in April, celebrations have evolved to correspond with varying ideal planting weather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to growing national and international popularity, the Arbor Day Foundation was founded in 1972 to "inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees." The Arbor Day Foundation fuels their mission through the Arbor Day Farm, promoting and coordinating events, working with government and corporate entities, and distributing over' 10 million trees annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What began as a local holiday born of one man's enthusiasm has flourished into a global celebration. From Florida to Oregon and Cambodia to Venezuela, people gather to honor the ideals of Arbor Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and cherish its goal, captured convincingly in the words of its founder, J. Sterling Morton--"the cultivation of trees is the cultivation of the good, the beautiful, and the ennobling in man."</paragraph>
