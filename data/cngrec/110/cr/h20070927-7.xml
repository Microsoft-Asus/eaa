    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a wonderful man and my constituent, the Reverend James T. Golden of the Ward Temple A.M.E. Church in Bradenton, Florida. He is the guest chaplain of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Golden is a pillar of the Tampa Bay community, with a long record of public service and dedication. In the year 2000, he was elected to the Bradenton City Council, which he continues to represent with distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Golden is a veteran of the United States Army. He received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Stetson University in Deland, Florida, and went on to become a master of divinity from the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta. He returned to Florida to attend the University of Florida and received his juris doctorate. Reverend Golden has shared his great knowledge and insight with students throughout Florida, and he ministers to the congregation of the Ward  Temple A.M.E. Church in Bradenton and serves his community through many nonprofit organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is joined today by his wife Mildred, nephew Kahreem, and niece Lyleigha. I am proud to stand in recognition of his accomplishments and leadership today.</paragraph>
