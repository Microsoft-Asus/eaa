    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Fidel Castro has stepped down as President and dictator of Cuba and handed over his communist rule to his brother Raul. The news of Castro's resignation was met with cautious optimism by many who see this as an opportunity for the Cuban people to build a new and free society. However, it appears that for now the Castro family elite will continue to reign in a communist state and stifle the voices of reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, political prisoners remain housed in inhumane conditions</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am inspired by the phenomenally successful and patriotic Cuban American business leaders in the community I represent, such as Louis and Nena Gonda, who have always kept alive the ideals o f a free Cuba to provide opportunity for the people of Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
