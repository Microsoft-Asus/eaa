  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Maryland is proud to honor its sons and daughters whose accomplishments touch the lives of others. We are particularly elated when an individual's talents and achievements are recognized throughout the Nation and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chaplain Barry C. Black is one such Marylander, born and raised with five sisters and two brothers in Baltimore by a prudent and faithful mother, Pearline Black. He has penned his life story in a recent book titled, "From the Hood to the Hill, " stating that, "in spite of unpromising beginnings, my siblings and I bucked the statistics and turned out fine (O)ne of the boys even became a two-star Navy admiral and the first African-American Navy chief of chaplains. Later, he was selected as the  sixty-second chaplain of the United States Senate. I am that child." These are but a few of the stellar accomplishments in a life that serves as inspiration for us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though I have only been a Senator for 5 months, I have spent several mornings opening the Senate's sessions, and I am always inspired by Chaplain Black's serene manner, the conviction in his voice, the faith present in his life, and the ministry he has accepted. In addition to leading daily prayer before each session of the Senate, Chaplain Black and his dedicated staff conduct Bible studies and attend to the spiritual needs of our Nation's leaders and the thousands of staff members who  work in the Senate. His invaluable leadership and service to our country are worthy of both recognition and celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus will honor the Reverend Barry C. Black, the Chaplain of the Senate, with a resolution and the presentation of a plaque honoring him for a distinguished career of leadership and service to the Senate and the larger community. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
