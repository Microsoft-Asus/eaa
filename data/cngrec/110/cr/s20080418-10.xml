  <narrative>HOLD ON NOMINATION OF HARVEY E. JOHNSON -- (Senate - April 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3173">S3173</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, more than 40 months ago, prior to his confirmation as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff told me in my office that if confirmed he would move expeditiously to implement the National Emergency Technology Guard--NET Guard--program. Unfortunately, Secretary Chertoff has so far failed to honor this pledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea of NET Guard was born in the aftermath of 9-11, when a number of communications and technology companies told me they wanted to help New York City when it was attacked--and there was no system for using their volunteers. Then-Senator George Allen and I moved on a bipartisan basis to support a program, called NET Guard, that would ensure that volunteers with technology expertise could be fully utilized in future crises. These teams of local volunteers with science and technology expertise  would be vital in assisting our communities in responding to attacks on communications networks, or recovering from natural disasters. Congress authorized the establishment of NET Guard 5 years ago, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, DHS has delayed and delayed and so far failed to implement this critical program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At times, Secretary Chertoff has appeared willing to move forward on NET Guard, but each time he stops short of action. On August 1, 2007, the Secretary pledged to me in a letter that he would be submitting a request to fund the NET Guard program in the President's fiscal year 2009 budget. I will ask that a copy of Secretary Chertoff's letter be printed in the RECORD. I thought this meant that the Secretary recognized NET Guard's potential and understood Congress's intention in authorizing  the program. Unfortunately he failed to fulfill this promise and we again find ourselves at an impasse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel that further delay is unacceptable. I reluctantly feel that I must put a hold on the nomination of Harvey E. Johnson who has been nominated by President Bush to serve as Deputy Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, until the NET Guard program is up and running.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I place this hold reluctantly, but see no other option in light of the Department's foot dragging. I am hopeful that the Department will soon be able to stand up a NET Guard program, and I will be able to withdraw my hold and Mr. Johnson's nomination can move through the Senate. In the meantime, I  will object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider Mr. Johnson's nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that the letter to which I referred be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The letter follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOMELAND SECURITY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>August 1, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SENATOR WYDEN: Thank you for taking time this morning to discuss the Department of Homeland Security's plans for the National Emergency Technology Guard (NET Guard) program. Following my June 29, 2007 letter to you that outlined our program approach, and as a prelude to our discussion, members of the Department's NET Guard team briefed your staff on our proposed plan. The positive feedback from your staff, coupled with your positive feedback this morning and the positive feedback  that we have received from State, local, and private sector stakeholders, gives us confidence that we are taking the right approach to implementing this important disaster response program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the Department is moving forward with plans to implement 12-month NET Guard pilots beginning in September 2007. The recommendation to establish pilots in September is consistent with the NET Guard Scoping Initiative Report, which I will provide to you upon its completion this month. To fund our efforts in fiscal year 2007 and 2008, we will continue to work with Congressional appropriators. I will also submit a request to the White House Office of Management and Budget to fund the  NET Guard program in fiscal year 2009. On these and other program matters, the Department's Office of Legislative Affairs will keep your staff apprised of our progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your interest and support of the Department's disaster response mission and look forward to working with you on this and other issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
  </speaking>
