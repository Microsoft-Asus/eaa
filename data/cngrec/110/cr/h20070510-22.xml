    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a life of accomplishment of astronaut Walter "Wally" Schirra and express the condolences of a grateful Nation to his entire family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wally passed away last Thursday at the age of 84, leaving behind a wife, Josephine, and daughter, Suzanne, and Walter Schirra III.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a world where we place a premium on innovation and discovery, Wally was a pioneer in both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the history of man is measured on a timeline of exploration, and for Walter Schirra, it was his life. Pushing the limits of discovery, determined to work harder and go farther than anyone before him, Wally had the distinction of being the fifth American in space and the third American in orbit on an adventure that includes six circlings of the globe that lasted more than 9 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He led a lifetime built on breaking barriers, laying the groundwork for future lunar landings. On December 15, 1965, he piloted the Gemini 6 in what was to be the first attempted rendezvous by two-manned spacecraft in space. Three years later, in October of 1968, he concluded his third and final mission when he was launched as commander of Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo mission. This flight made Commander Schirra the only Mercury astronaut to fly aboard Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecrafts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His lifetime of achievement also included a decorated record of service in the United States military. In Korea, he flew 90 combat missions and was credited with downing at least one MIG fighter. His courage and valor was eventually recognized with three distinguished flying crosses, two air medals and two NASA Distinguished Service Medals and induction into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While he was remembered most for his contributions in the United States space program, Wally also made tremendous strides in advancing the efforts of the Reuben H. Fleet Aerospace Museum in San Diego.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While he was no longer to venture out into outer space, Wally took off on his 35-foot sailboat. I guess he figured if the skies were no longer available to him, he would instead canvass the oceans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Astronaut "Wally" Schirra will always have a place in our Nation's history, an inspiring figure of humble beginnings with daring dreams, a pioneer of our space program who helped the United States win the race against the Soviet Union in the space race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we mourn the loss of this remarkable man, we should celebrate his great life of achievements. We can rest assured that his legacy will be long felt by many generations yet to come.</paragraph>
