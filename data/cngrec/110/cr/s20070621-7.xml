    <paragraph>This morning, under an order entered yesterday, the Senate will resume the energy legislation. We will have 70 minutes of debate on the matter of the Kyl amendment, which is No. 1733, and a motion to invoke cloture on the Baucus-Grassley energy tax amendment, with that time equally divided and controlled. Once the time is used or yielded back, the Senate will conduct two rollcall votes: The first vote will be in relation to the Kyl amendment, followed by cloture on the Baucus-Grassley  amendment. As Members are aware, if cloture is invoked on the Baucus amendment, then postcloture time runs and the second-degree amendments which have been timely filed and are germane postcloture are in order. The filing deadline for germane second-degree amendments is 11 a.m. this morning, 20 minutes from now.</paragraph>
