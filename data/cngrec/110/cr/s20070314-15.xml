    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that on March 9, I was unable to vote on certain provisions of <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, the Improving America's Security Act of 2007. I wish to address these votes so that the people of the great State of Kansas who elected me to serve them as United States Senator may know my position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding vote No. 68, on the motion to invoke cloture on the Cornyn amendment No. 312, as modified, I would have voted to invoke cloture on this amendment. My vote would not have altered the result of this motion.</paragraph>
