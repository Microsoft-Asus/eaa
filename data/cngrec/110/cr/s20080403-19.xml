    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the night of January 21, 2008, in Charleston, SC, Adolphus Simmons was shot to death on the steps of his apartment. According to reports, Simmons had been dressed as a woman when the attack occurred. Friends say that Simmons, an 18-year-old transgender person, often dressed in women's clothes. Sadly, the suspect charged with Simmons' murder is only 15 years old. Baffled by this seemingly unprovoked attack, investigators are not ruling out that Simmons may have been targeted based on his sexual  orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
