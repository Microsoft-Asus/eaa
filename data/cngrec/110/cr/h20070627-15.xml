    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a recent article in The Washington Post highlights the importance of expanding health savings accounts for America's families. The article mentioned a woman who switched to an HSA with a high deductible health plan after her insurance premiums increased by 42 percent in 1 year. As a result, the monthly cost of her asthma medication consumed all the money in her HSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patients with chronic conditions shouldn't have to pay a high deductible before their coverage begins. Giving patients with HSAs the freedom to choose plans that offer up-front coverage will avoid hospitalizations and reduce the costs that are borne by all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I introduced <bill type="h" number="2639">H.R. 2639</bill>, the Promoting Health for Future Generations Act of 2007. The bill permits HSA owners to receive prescription drugs before paying a deductible. It also permits working families to accumulate more money in these accounts, resolving the situations like the one pointed out in The Washington Post article.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to expand coverage and empower patients by cosponsoring <bill type="h" number="2639">H.R. 2639</bill>. Doing so will give Americans greater flexibility and independence when managing their families' health care needs.</paragraph>
