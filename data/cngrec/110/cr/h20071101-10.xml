    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to set the record straight. This administration has accused Congress of being a "failure," and that is simply not true. I think the President has this Congress confused with last year's "Do-Nothing Congress." This Congress has successfully passed numerous pieces of legislation that have been supported by the majority of the American people and the President has signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed, for example, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations and to provide greater protection for first responders and security for our country. We have raised the minimum wage, improved our economic competitiveness, and enacted the College Cost Reduction Act. I am particularly proud of this law, which increases funding for Federal Pell Grants by more than $11 billion and will make college more affordable for low-income students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then of course there is SCHIP. This Congress has bent over backwards to address concerns about the legislation, and yet this administration continues to oppose health care for our Nation's most vulnerable children. I am proud to go home this weekend and tell my constituents about what this Congress has done.</paragraph>
