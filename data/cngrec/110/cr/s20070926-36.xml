    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this time to recognize and congratulate the Conrath Post Office, located in Conrath, WI, on its 100th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1904, the Conrath brothers settled in what would later become the village of Conrath. Located in northwest Wisconsin, the village sat on the Wisconsin Central Railroad line between Owen, WI, and Duluth, MN. In 1905, Frank Conrath sent 10 possible names to the railroad general passenger agent for the naming of the village. The general passenger agent decided on the name that still stands today: Conrath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Frank Conrath wrote to the postmaster general in 1905 to request that a post office be established in the village. The post office moved into the Rusk Farm Company Store where George W. Kendall became the first postmaster in 1907.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first rural mail carrier in Conrath was Joseph Hahn, who delivered the mail in a single-cylinder, chain-drive, high-wheel-car. Throughout the past century, there have been 21 postmasters and postmistresses, as well as numerous rural route carriers, who have diligently served the residents of Conrath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as Mrs. Conrath did over 100 years ago, residents in Conrath have continued to express the need for the Conrath Post Office as well as value the service and benefit to their community. That is why I am proud to have worked with the residents of the village in support of their efforts to maintain this post office. When they told me it might close, I worked with residents to convey these concerns to the U.S. Postal Service in order to ensure that this historic post office remains open and  that rural residents continue to have effective and consistent postal service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our State and Nation, I congratulate the Conrath Post Office on its 100th anniversary and send my best wishes to all residents of the village of Conrath.</paragraph>
