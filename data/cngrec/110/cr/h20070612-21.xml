  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after years of funding cuts by Republican Congresses and the Bush administration to key education, veterans, college aid and transportation programs, this House is now bringing appropriations bills to the floor that invest in the right priorities, while also remaining fiscally responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, Democratic leadership will pass the largest increase in veterans health care funding in history, a critical step in fulfilling our Nation's obligation to our service men and women, their families and our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Veterans Health Administration estimates that they will treat 54,000 more troops in 2008 than they did over the last year, including more than 263,000 veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This House is going to provide our veterans the health care services they are entitled to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also add 1,000 new claims processors to reduce the backlog of benefit claims so that our veterans will get the services they need in a timely way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Congress is dedicated to fulfilling our commitment to our veterans in a fiscally responsible way.</paragraph>
