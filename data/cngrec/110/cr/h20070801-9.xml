    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday, the final report from the President's bipartisan Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors was released. The main goal for the Commission is to assure that every member of our Armed Forces receives the prompt, exceptional care most are already receiving. Included in these recommendations were prevention and treatment of posttraumatic distress disorder and strengthening VA support for families of the wounded. In addition,  a single point of contact for patients and families is crucial so the way toward recovery is simplified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are striving to ensure that our brave men and women returning from battle are given the best treatment possible. Commission Co-Chair Bob Dole points out that, "Today, seven out of eight survive, many with injuries that would have been fatal in past wars."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the medical personnel that are working diligently to make sure our brave troops are receiving the care they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
