    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great American and true military heroine who has honorably served our country for 30 years in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps: COL Lenore S. Enzel. COL Lenore Enzel was born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens, NY. She received her diploma in nursing from Roosevelt Hospital School of Nursing, her baccalaureate degree in nursing from Hunter College-Bellevue Hospital, and her master's degree from the University of Hawaii. Upon retiring from the U.S.  Army after faithfully serving for 30 years, Colonel Enzel and her husband, LTC Richard Berry, will reside in New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Enzel began her military career as a staff nurse at Tripler Army Medical Center, HI. She quickly rose through the ranks and served throughout the country, including in New Jersey, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, as well as two other tours at Tripler Army Medical Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In each assignment, Colonel Enzel excelled and was rewarded with greater responsibilities. After serving as ambulatory section chief at Fort Hood, TX, she transitioned to Recruiting Command, serving as the 2nd Recruiting Brigade chief nurse and later as the 2nd Army Medical Detachment commander. Colonel Enzel successfully assimilated into the highly complex recruiting environment and became the No. 1 subject matter expert for Army medical recruiting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With her path to executive leadership clearly set, Colonel Enzel served as deputy commander at Fort Huachuca, AZ. Colonel Enzel spearheaded the reengineering process as the hospital downsized to a freestanding clinic. Colonel Enzel returned to Hawaii, serving as deputy director and later director, clinical services, TRICARE Pacific Lead Agency, Tripler Army Medical Center. She managed complex health care issues in a joint arena for 380,000 beneficiaries in 70 countries spread across 13 time zones  and 100 million square miles. Colonel Enzel's last assignment was in Texas, as deputy commander for patient services/nursing, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Ft. Bliss, TX. She managed care provided to 132,000 beneficiaries at this 150-bed teaching hospital. The increased productivity of the hospital has in large part been due to her drive and leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Enzel is a meritorious leader, administrator, clinician, educator, and mentor. Throughout her career she has served with valor and profoundly impacted the entire Army Medical Department. Her performance reflects exceptionally on herself, the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense, and the United States of America. I extend my deepest appreciation to COL Lenore Suzan Enzel on behalf of a grateful nation for her more than 30 years of dedicated military service.</paragraph>
