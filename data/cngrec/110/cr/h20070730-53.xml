  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="427">H. Res. 427</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on November 15, 2006, the Government of Canada opened a commercial hunt for seals in the waters off the east coast of Canada;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins and the subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of seal products;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in February 2003, the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans in Canada authorized the highest quota for harp seals in Canadian history, allowing nearly 1,000,000 seals to be killed over a 3-year period;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas more than 1,000,000 seals have been killed over the past 3 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas harp seal pups can legally be hunted in Canada as soon as they have begun to molt their white coats at approximately 12 days of age;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 95 percent of the seals killed over the past 5 years were pups between just 12 days and 12 weeks of age, many of which had not yet eaten their first solid meal or taken their first swim;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a report by an independent team of veterinarians invited to observe the hunt by the International Fund for Animal Welfare concluded that the seal hunt failed to comply with basic animal welfare regulations in Canada and that governmental regulations regarding humane killing were not being respected or enforced;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the veterinary report concluded that as many as 42 percent of the seals studied were likely skinned while alive and conscious;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the commercial slaughter of seals in the Northwest Atlantic is inherently cruel, whether the killing is conducted by clubbing or by shooting;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt, but escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never recovered, and these seals are not counted in official kill statistics, making the actual kill level far higher than the level that is reported;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals is a commercial slaughter carried out almost entirely by non-Native people from the East Coast of Canada for seal fur, oil, and penises (used as aphrodisiacs in some Asian markets);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the fishing and sealing industries in Canada continue to justify the expanded seal hunt on the grounds that the seals in the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the recovery of cod stocks, despite the lack of any credible scientific evidence to support this claim;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas two Canadian government marine scientists reported in 1994 that the true cause of cod depletion in the North Atlantic was over-fishing, and the consensus among the international scientific community is that seals are not responsible for the collapse of cod stocks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas harp and hooded seals are a vital part of the complex ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic, and because the seals consume predators of commercial cod stocks, removing the seals might actually inhibit recovery of cod stocks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas certain ministries of the Government of Canada have stated clearly that there is no evidence that killing seals will help groundfish stocks to recover; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives urges the Government of Canada to end the commercial hunt on seals.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are all familiar with National Geographic images of fluffy white baby seals nestled next to their mothers. We stare at them on our TV screens or in our magazines and reflexively remark about how adorable they are. But now imagine, if you can, the brutal death that awaits hundreds of thousands of these baby seals every single year. With stunning barbarism, Canadian hunters swoop in with heavy clubs and stun guns to immobilize these little innocent creatures. They are then skinned  alive simply so that their soft white fur can adorn winter coats, coats that could be composed of different materials without torturing animals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These gruesome images are sadly commonplace in the Canadian Northwest. The Canadian Government estimates that over 1 million seals have been killed in the most recent 3-year period. Public outcry over this barbarism led to a ban of all seal products in the United States and in the European Union in 1983. Unfortunately, the public seems to have forgotten that the grisly practices of commercial seal hunters still go on, and international pressure on Canada to end the hunt has abated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My resolution brings the focus of the United States Congress back to this heinous yearly slaughter. It urges the Canadian Government to cease this gruesome practice and bring Canadian policy in line with that of the United States and the European Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me note that this annual seal slaughter, enacted for mere vanity and vulgar consumerism, is also having deleterious effects on the ecosystem. Nature's careful balance is being thrown off by the depletion of the seal population. The barbaric seal hunt disturbs the food chain, hurting the fishing industry, which is now suffering in Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ending the commercial seal hunt is not simply a matter of saving beautiful and innocent animals that tug at our hearts. It is a matter of intelligent ecomanagement, prevention of cruelty against animals, and helping our friends to the north restore their otherwise pristine international reputation. Killing baby seals echoes the torture and cruel killing of so many other animals around the world. As cochairman of the Congressional Friends of Animals Caucus, I will continue to bring the world's  attention to such practices wherever they exist. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important and humane resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harp seals, which live off of Canada's east coast, are sought for their pelts. Canadian hunters, who are regulated by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, have killed almost a million seals in the past 3 years. The government set a quota of 270,000 seals for the season of 2007, which is lower than the limit of 335,000 seals set in last year's season. The quota is determined annually by the department and is set based on estimates of the current seal population. Many concerned citizens  are quite upset that these seals are killed in an inhumane way, since many  are beaten unconscious and then skinned while they are still alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An independent group of veterinarians, invited by the International Fund for Animal Welfare to observe the seal hunt, concluded that the seal hunt was out of compliance with basic animal welfare regulations in Canada. Also, 95 percent of the seals are less than a year old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution urges Canada to end the commercial seal hunt. Our Canadian friends are good allies and partners in many areas of common interest, and we hope that they will take this important step. Many have raised alarm about this, including our distinguished chairman of our committee, Mr. Lantos, and I thank him for his many years of leadership on the plight of people who have been abused, but also animals who have been mistreated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 427, urging the Government of Canada to end its commercial seal hunts. While many countries have banned the importation of seal products, seal hunting in Canada has grown steadily in size over the past six years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Canadian commercial seal hunt is said to have killed approximately 350,000 seals this year--a huge increase from the 67,500 average number of seal deaths during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The seals are either clubbed to death or shot with high-powered rifles so as not to bloody their fur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year the Canadian Government claimed the seal killings brought in $16 million. I question the number and believe even if it is accurate $16 million does not come close to justifying this brutality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixteen million dollars is a mere fraction of the $3 billion that Canada receives from seafood exports. In addition, commercial seal hunting amounts to less than three percent of the annual incomes of commercial fishermen. Furthermore, the market for seal meat is limited. It is generally considered to be inedible and only a few nations import it for human consumption, additional proof of how wasteful seal hunting truly is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canada allows the seal hunt because it allegedly helps provide jobs for the region. Newfoundland experiences unemployment rates of up to 40 percent in winter because of its reliance on seafaring jobs and the collapse of the cod fishing industry. While I am sensitive to these concerns, how can this justify the cruel hunting methods employed during seal hunts. Eyewitness reports indicate numerous violations of Canada's marine mammal hunting regulations, such as baby seals being culled, animals  being skinned alive, and injured animals being left behind to die slowly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="427">H. Res. 427</bill> urges the Canadian government to end commercial seal hunting, putting a stop to this cruel practice. I strongly urge its passage.</paragraph>
