  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when Democrats gained the majority in this House last November, we pledged to fight to make America better for all Americans, not just the privileged few. This Congress has already passed legislation increasing the minimum wage and making college more affordable to middle-class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, in a bipartisan fashion, we will continue our work on behalf of middle-class families by bringing legislation to the floor that would restore workers' rights to form unions and to collectively bargain for better salaries and better benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when corporate executives are routinely negotiating lavish pay and retirement benefits for themselves, workers have little leverage to negotiate for a better life. This has been particularly concerning over the last 6 years when wages have remained stagnant while everyday costs like housing, transportation, education and health care have increased dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act says that if the majority of workers at a workplace sign cards saying they want a union, they get a union. The act protects the rights of employers, too. The legislation shares bipartisan support and is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans. Let's pass it this week.</paragraph>
