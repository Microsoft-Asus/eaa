  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="SYDNEY POLLACK: IN MEMORIAM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of a very special man, Sydney Pollack of Los Angeles County, who died May 26, 2008. He was 73 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sydney Pollack was a master filmmaker and will be fondly remembered for his over four decades of work in Hollywood as a director, producer, and actor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sydney Irwin Pollack was born to Rebecca and David Pollack on July 1, 1934, in Lafayette, IN. He was raised in South Bend and moved to New York City in 1952 to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse. While there, Sydney so impressed head acting teacher Sanford Meisner, that Mr. Meisner quickly made Sydney his assistant. Sydney went on to teach at the Neighborhood Playhouse from 1954-1959, guiding the talents of actors such as Robert Duvall, Rip Torn, Brenda Vaccaro, and Claire Griswold, whom he  married in 1958.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the urging of Director John Frankenheimer, Sydney left New York City in 1961 for Hollywood where he began work as a director of television shows. In 1965, Sydney made his movie-directing debut in the suicide help-line drama, "The Slender Thread" with Sidney Poitier and Anne Bancroft. In 1969, Sydney received his first Best Director nomination for an Academy Award for the film "They Shoot Horses Don't They?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an actor, Sydney's key roles include Woody Allen's "Husbands and Wives," 1992, Robert Altman's "The Player," 1992, and Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut," 1999. Sydney's most notable acting and directing role was in his 1982 comedy film "Tootsie" in which he played George Fields, agent to the main character played by Dustin Hoffman. His production company, Mirage, produced this film as well as many others, most recently "Michael Clayton" in which Sydney gave yet another memorable  performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps Sydney Pollack's biggest directing triumph came in 1985 with "Out of Africa." This landmark film received seven Academy Awards--Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Original Score, Art Direction, Sound--and three Golden Globe Awards--Best Picture, Supporting Actor, Original Score. "Out of Africa" was also an example of one of the great collaborations of all time between actor and director. Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford made seven classic films together that  include "This Property Is Condemned," "Jeremiah Johnson," "The Electric Horseman," "3 Days of the Condor," "The Way We Were," and "Havana."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who knew Sydney Pollack recognize him as a courageous, innovative and brilliant man. He took pride in tackling social issues through films which raise interesting and challenging  questions. His work as an ambassador of cinema will be remembered gratefully by all those whose lives he touched. He touched mine, and he will be deeply missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sydney is survived by his wife Claire Griswold, and their two daughters, Rachel Pollack Sorman and Rebecca Pollack Parker.</paragraph>
