    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, free our resources. Our families have to pay $4, almost $4 a gallon to fill up. They are spending $70 just to fill up mid-size cars. We can't take this anymore, but yet we have the resources right here within the United States, whether it's offshore, Alaska, oil shale in Colorado that has been taken off and we can't drill in it. Today, we are going to do tax credits, 1 year of tax credits, that are going to be meaningless to develop biofuels and cellulosic ethanol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have the resources here, my friends, to decrease the price at the pumps by adding more supply, and it's being blocked. It's being blocked by the leadership here. Free up our resources, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
