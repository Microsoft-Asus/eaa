  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we begin the third week of this new Congress, it is important that the American people know what we have accomplished so far on their behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our first week in session, we changed the rules on how this institution works, cutting ties between lobbyists and lawmakers, and reinstituting commonsense pay-as-you-go budget rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week we began our 100-hour agenda, passing four pieces of legislation that will help the American people live better and healthier lives. We increased the minimum wage for the first time in 9 years. We passed legislation giving the government the ability to fund promising stem cell research. We passed a bill that allows the government to negotiate better prescription drug prices for American seniors. We passed long overdue legislation instituting the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission  that should make our Nation safer. And we are not finished yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we will make college more affordable by cutting interest rates in half on student loans and investing in biofuels by repealing unnecessary tax breaks to Big Oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats are delivering on the promises we made to the American people.</paragraph>
