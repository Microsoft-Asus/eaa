  <narrative>UNJUST PROSECUTION AND APPEAL OF FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16797]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it has been 336 days since two United States Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. They're serving 11 and 12 years in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, the White House released its list of 29 pardons which are traditionally granted around Christmastime. Among the list of pardons were those convicted of conspiring to import marijuana, possessing a stolen motor vehicle and distributing cocaine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there are 7 days until Christmas, yet Agents Ramos and Compean, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are still in Federal prison, away from their families and loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is bipartisan agreement among Members of Congress that the overzealous prosecution of these agents and their excessive prison sentence is a tremendous miscarriage of justice. In recent days, I was pleased to join Congressman ED ROYCE and other House colleagues in writing the President to urge him to ensure that Agents Ramos and Compean are released from jail by Christmas. I was also happy to join Congressman BILL DELAHUNT and others in cosponsoring a resolution calling on  the President to commute the agents' sentences to time already served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A ruling on this case from the 5th United States Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans is expected within weeks. Nothing can erase the suffering these agents and their families have undergone and the months they have spent in prison in solitary confinement away from their families; however, a judgment in favor of Ramos and Compean in this appeal would be an important victory and the first act of justice these agents have seen since their arrest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the appeal hearing, one of the three judges on this case, Judge E. Grady Jolly, said, "It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason, this got way out of hand."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in the eyes of many Americans, the prosecution of these border agents was not justified. An unbiased review of this case by Attorney General Mukasey, a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee and a Presidential pardon for these agents are all steps that can and should be taken to rectify this gross miscarriage of justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the efforts of this Congress and the American people, I am hopeful that justice will soon prevail for Ramos and Compean, that the nightmare of their imprisonment will end, and they will soon return home to their families and those they long to be with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to ensure the families of Ramos and Compean that those of us in Congress will not forget this injustice until these men are released.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Speaker, I ask God to bless our men and women in uniform and their families, and ask God to continue to bless America.</paragraph>
