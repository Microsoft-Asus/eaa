  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this evening I would like to speak about a true statesman that we have lost in our country and in my home State of Missouri. We lost, over the weekend, former U.S. Senator Thomas F. Eagleton. Not only was he a true statesman, but he had a giant heart, a powerful intellect, and a keen wit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He leaves behind his wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1956, two children, son Terence and daughter Christie, three grandchildren and a brother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not long ago, friends gathered in St. Louis and celebrated 50 years since Senator Eagleton had entered public service. And he had many chapters in an amazing life. He served his country honorably in the United States Navy,  stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center from 1948 to 1949, continued on to graduate with honors from Amherst College in 1951 and Harvard Law School in 1953.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was admitted to the Missouri Bar in 1953; proceeded in a series of offices, beginning, he was elected as the youngest circuit attorney in the city of St. Louis in its history at the age of 27. He followed that by being elected the youngest Missouri State attorney general at the age of 31, and the youngest Lieutenant Governor of the State of Missouri by age 35.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on and in 1968 was elected to the United States Senate representing Missouri. In his first term in the United States Senate, at the age of 42, he was selected by George McGovern to be his Vice Presidential candidate. And while he was only that nominee for a few days, and he will be known as such in history, he went on to serve three terms in the United States Senate, sponsoring legislation, varied, but of great importance to our country, the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, an amendment  which halted the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and as the chief author of the Federal War Powers Act that limits the authority of the President to conduct war without congressional approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After an amazing career in public service, he came home to St. Louis, and there he gave back to his community, to new generations of people to encourage them in public service, to new generations of students. He was a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and St. Louis University where he shared his vast knowledge and experience with young people who will be our leaders of tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To others in public service, myself, I am fortunate to say, included, he was a great mentor, example and friend. He never failed to promote the people and the notions that he felt strongly about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his private life in St. Louis, he was well known for acting with regard to the civic good and giving back to his community. He worked to bring the St. Louis Rams to St. Louis, and recently, in the 2006 elections, was a chief advocate for Missouri's amendment to the Stem Cell Initiative which passed by a vote of the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In downtown St. Louis, our new Federal courthouse is named after Senator Eagleton. It towers in our downtown just west of the famous St. Louis Arch. Thomas Eagleton's career and life towers in our country as a great example for all of us, whether we are involved in public service or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was legendary for writing lengthy notes to people. I will treasure those notes that he has sent to me; those notes, that advice, that wise counsel that he shared with so many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact that he has had on young people, their leadership for the future and what he has given to our great State and our country, he will be sorely missed but very well remembered.</paragraph>
