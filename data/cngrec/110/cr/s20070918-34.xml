  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Mr. Hancel Porterfield on his retirement from Federal service on September 30, 2007, as the Corrosion Prevention and Control Program Manager for the Marine Corps. Hank, as he is known, along with a handful of staff, has been instrumental in giving new direction and cohesion to the Marine Corps' efforts to combat corrosion. Since being hired as the first Program Manager for USMC CPAC, Mr. Porterfield has been instrumental in completely changing  the direction of CPAC from a study program administered by the Naval Surface Warfare Command, NSWC, to a program serving the warfighter at the Marine Expeditionary Force, MEF, level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only has Mr. Porterfield created a full service program with a workforce of 95 people from Camp Lejeune to Okinawa in just 3 1/2  years, Mr. Porterfield also established a research and development arm to examine new products, procedures, and methods for reducing corrosion. Recently, I had occasion to participate in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a U.S. Marines Corps corrosion prevention and control complex in Kaneohe Bay, HI, and had the privilege of meeting Mr. Porterfield in person. I was  impressed by his dedication to duty and his service and leadership in launching the USMC CPAC Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to express my deepest appreciation and warmest aloha to Mr. Porterfield. In government we all hope one person can make a difference. I think Mr. Porterfield is one person who has made a difference and leaves behind a legacy of success. Best wishes Hank for a long and enjoyable retirement.</paragraph>
