    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House passed the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007, and I was very proud to support this legislation. And I thank Chairman Rangel and, of course, Chairman Miller for their insight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of years ago, when we moved on the permanent normal trade relations with China, I worked with the then-Clinton administration to craft an executive order that addressed the question of the loss of jobs when there was a trade bill. We thought that this particular executive order could lay the groundwork for providing for small businesses and those various sectors of the country that would lose their employment or their economic opportunity. Well, look at the trade imbalance now. This  is a forthright bill that expands the opportunities for service workers, manufacturers, insists on enrollment opportunities, and it is a good start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know what the journey will be on future trade bills, but America has to start standing up for its own workers, its own regions, and making sure that small businesses do not lose their economic opportunity simply because we want to engage in globalization. Globalization may be good, but Americans have to be protected, and I was very glad to vote for this legislation today.</paragraph>
