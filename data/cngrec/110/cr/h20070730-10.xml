    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, former Cook County Commissioner Rose Marie Love, and a member of many groups and organizations in the community where I live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rose passed away last week, but she was one of the founders of the National Association of Community Health Centers, founder of the National Consumer Health Organization, a member of many local groups and organizations, and the person most responsible, I think, for my being involved in public life, electoral politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say thank you, Rose, and rest in peace.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
