    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to publicly recognize School Social Work Week, which is taking place March 2-8, 2008. This important week honors school social workers, who play a vital role in the development of our young students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Barbara was a school social worker for more than 18 years, so I understand the critical importance of the services they provide to children, families, and schools. Not only do school social workers provide family and student counseling, crisis intervention, family advocacy, truancy prevention, assistance with basic needs, and community referrals for long-term needs, but they also assist already overwhelmed and underfunded schools in finding ways to assist their "at risk" students. The  presence of school social workers has helped increase attendance rates, academic performance, appropriate behavior, and parental involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the best way we can honor school social workers is by providing them with the resources they need to accomplish their jobs and serve our students. Children often must seek help at school for problems they are experiencing personally, as well as at home. Experts note that early identification and intervention can be beneficial in helping distressed young people cope with and handle the problems in their lives. Without school social workers and the wonderful services they provide, far  too many children's needs would remain unaddressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons and countless others, proudly I stand today and applaud the wonderful work of these dedicated individuals. I am pleased that their tireless efforts are being publicly celebrated. It is with great honor that I share their impressive commitment to helping and educating our youth with my colleagues.</paragraph>
