    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very honored to have welcomed Pastor John I. Caples of Jesus Name Apostolic Church to open the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first really got to know Pastor Caples after the murder of Jarreau Patterson and David Mackins, just 16 years old. It was Pastor Caples that brought together the families of the murdered with the families of the murderers that ended a cycle of violence in my community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He helped restart an athletic program. And with assistance from the wider community, he built a basketball court in just 8 weeks to relieve some of the tensions of the community. He then started the Family First Center, first in a basement, now three stories tall, reaching out to help at-risk youth turn away from violence and gangs, but especially despair, saving one heart at a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Caples tells us that the government can't do it all, but it can change one heart of one child at a time and make the most difference. He is one of the men I admire most whose ministry saves lives. He changes hearts. And most importantly, he returns the soul to a community that is in need of a very big heart with hope.</paragraph>
