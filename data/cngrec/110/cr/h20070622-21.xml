    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend the majority leader for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour business and at 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to reiterate that, as we did the other day. It will be 6 p.m. I would hope that the offices that are covering the floor, that they remind their Members 6 p.m. on Monday will be the votes. The congressional baseball game is at 7:30, and we want to give Members time to get to the game. It is a fun event and a collegial event, and we are going to accommodate that by accelerating by half an hour the votes on Monday at 6 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of those bills will be announced later today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning hour business and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m., and on Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m. We will consider the following fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills: Interior and Environment; Financial Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say to my friends that those two bills will be considered, and we will obviously, consistent, hopefully, with our agreement, try to enter into unanimous consent agreements in terms of the amendments and the timing of those amendments. And we will see how the balance of the schedule goes Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And from the fact that you said we will see how the week goes Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I think that anticipates that at least there is a chance that with the State-Justice-Commerce bill's not being next week, we may be able to be done on Thursday, and the Members can start their work period on Friday. Would that be one of the options that would be a possibility at least?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer to that is yes. Again, we are going to complete those two bills at least. There may be some other legislative business. We don't know whether there will be conference reports. As you know, there is a conference on the 9/11 bill and some other conference reports on other items that may come forward. But the answer to your question, I think, is essentially yes. If we can complete the work that we have before us prior to Friday, there may not be a need to meet on Friday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, a couple of other thoughts. I thank you for that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the conference reports that are upcoming, the 9/11 conference report is there.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Lobbying disclosure is the other.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I was going to ask about lobbying reform, if you thought there was a chance for that. Water Resources or the competitive science bills, do you have a report on where those might be?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I really don't. But because I don't have a report, my speculation is that there is not anticipation that those conferences will be completed in time to consider conference reports next week. We don't have any report on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking at the person who knows so much on my staff, Mr. Cogorno, to make sure that I am making a correct representation, but that is accurate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would also ask, I believe we announced last week, Madam Speaker, we thought that we were going to have the Science-State-Justice-Commerce bill up next week, and now we are not. Is there any particular reason for that that you can share with me on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield for a response.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, there is. We had a lot of discussion about this. As Mr. Obey has represented, because of the reforms that have been adopted and the transparency that we want to effect, but also the certification that is necessary for the legitimacy of projects, the time frame necessary to do the State-Justice-Commerce was more than could be accomplished within the time frame that the staff had available. As you know, they had to deal with the Interior and the Financial Services as well.  Science-State-Justice-Commerce was such that they simply could not get it done in time. Regrettably, therefore, it, too, as the other four bills, one of which was already scheduled for July, the defense appropriations bill, had to be moved to July.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for that. And I do believe that the protracted discussion we had and the agreement we made on transparency on these bills is a good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week's being a week where we will be leaving for a district work period, we won't have a chance for this colloquy, and I am wondering if you have any sense yet of where we will be the week we come back after the Independence Day break. Should we anticipate any appropriations bills that week or do you have other work that we might get to that week?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our expectation that the first week back, which will be the week of July 9, I believe, Tuesday, the 10th, at 6:30 p.m., we will not have appropriation bills that week. There will be legislation that week, and we will give notice of that next week so that one can anticipate it for the week that we come back from the July break. But we do not expect appropriation bills to start until the following week, the week of July 16.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. And I appreciate also that generally that is the way that it usually works out on a week where we are coming back from being in our districts the week before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week you said that we should anticipate an announcement on an omnibus energy bill by the Fourth of July recess. I am wondering if you have any more information on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes. What I said was it is my expectation that at the end of next  week, there will be an announcement. The Speaker has made it very clear that this is a priority, energy independence, and addressing the issue of global warming is a priority item for our caucus and, therefore, for the Congress, and that we will be addressing what we intend to do in July prior to leaving here for the July break.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>And would that also include a sense of when that bill would actually be on the floor when we make that announcement prior to the Fourth of July break?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't know that it will be specific, but certainly it is our hope and belief that it will be the month of July.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>And what I believe would be my last question is on the related Ways and Means energy tax bill that I believe in that committee has about $16 billion of tax increases in it as part of the energy package. Would that come up earlier than the rest of the energy package, or do you expect that to be on the floor at essentially the same time?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That decision has not been made, but my thought would be it would come up in close proximity, whether before, just after, but it would be considered in very close time frame to the consideration of the other pieces of the energy legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>And I believe the gentleman said that you really don't have a sense whether these bills would be on the floor in July or not, and if they are not on the floor in July, then we would look at sometime later in the year; is that correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>No. As I said, it is my expectation that we will have these bills on the floor in July.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if I can, it has been somewhat complicated, as you can understand, by the fact that we now have four appropriation bills that we anticipated in June now scheduled for July. So to that degree, I want to be somewhat careful about what I represent, because we are still in the process of determining the scheduling of all of those bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>That was not a question designed to go back and try to in any way create a problem. I think I did not hear what you said properly the first time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>July is the expectation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is helpful to me, and I appreciate the information.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
