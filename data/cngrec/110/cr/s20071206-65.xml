  <chair>Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research, the oldest and largest scientific cancer research organization in the United States, was founded on May 7, 1907, at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, by a group of physicians and scientists interested in research to further the investigation into and spread new knowledge about cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research is focused on every aspect of high-quality, innovative cancer research and is the authoritative source of information and publications about advances in the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, since its founding, the American Association for Cancer Research has accelerated the growth and dissemination of new knowledge about cancer and the complexity of this disease to speed translation of new discoveries for the benefit of cancer patients, and has provided the information needed by elected officials to make informed decisions on public policy and sustained funding for cancer research;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas partnerships with research scientists and the general public, survivors and patient advocates, philanthropic organizations, industry, and government have led to advanced breakthroughs, early detection tools which have increased survival rates, and a better quality of life for cancer survivors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas our national investment in cancer research has yielded substantial returns in terms of research advances and lives saved, with a scholarly estimate that every 1 percent decline in cancer mortality saves our national economy $500,000,000,000; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas cancer continues to be one of the most pressing public health concerns, killing 1 American every minute, and 12 individuals worldwide every minute;</chair>
  <chair>Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting on April 14 through 18, 2007, was a large and comprehensive gathering of leading cancer researchers, scientists, and clinicians engaged in all aspects of clinical investigations pertaining to human cancer as well as the scientific disciplines of cellular, molecular, and tumor biology, carcinogenesis, chemistry, developmental biology and stem cells, endocrinology, epidemiology and biostatistics, experimental and molecular therapeutics,  immunology, radiobiology and radiation oncology, imaging, prevention, and survivorship research;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, as part of its centennial celebration, the American Association for Cancer Research has published "Landmarks in Cancer Research" citing the events or discoveries after 1907 that have had a profound effect on advancing our knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these "Landmarks in Cancer Research" are intended as an educational, living document, an ever-changing testament to human ingenuity and creativity in the scientific struggle to understand and eliminate the diseases collectively known as cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, because more than 60 percent of all cancer occurs in people over the age of 65, issues relating to the interface of aging and cancer, ranging from the most basic science questions to epidemiologic relationships and to clinical and health services research issues, are of concern to society; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research is proactively addressing these issues paramount to our aging population through a Task Force on Cancer and Aging, special conferences, and other programs which engage the scientific community in response to this demographic imperative: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) congratulates the American Association for Cancer Research on its 100 year anniversary celebration, "A Century of Leadership in Science--A Future of Cancer Prevention and Cure";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes the invaluable contributions made by the American Association for Cancer Research in its quest to prevent and cure cancer and save lives through cancer research;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) expresses the gratitude of the people of the United States for the American Association for Cancer Research's contributions toward progress in advancing cancer research; and</chair>
  <chair> (4) declares the month of May 2007 as National Cancer Research Month to support the American Association for Cancer Research in its public education efforts to make cancer research a national and international priority, so that one day the disease of cancer will be relegated to history. &lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</chair>
