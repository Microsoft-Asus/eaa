  <narrative>IN MEMORY OF PORTER WAGONER -- (Senate - October 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13569">S13569</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are memories you have of childhood, and some of them are good memories and some of them are interesting memories and some of them are sad memories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember as a child being kind of forced to watch a TV program that, frankly, probably was not my favorite, but now, as I look back on it, I understand why my great-aunt and some of the other friends and neighbors I lived with and near in southwest Missouri loved Porter Wagoner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Porter Wagoner has died of cancer at the age of 80. He lived in Nashville, but he is one of Missouri's. He is a Missourian who went on to distinguish himself in country music. I know his funeral will be Thursday at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry House. When his life is celebrated at his funeral, I know hundreds and thousands of Missourians will feel the loss of Porter Wagoner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Porter Wagoner's life was a country music song. He was born on a farm near West Plains, MO. My mother's family has their roots in West Plains, MO. This is the heart of the Ozarks in the center of the south of Missouri. He was from a family that was very poor, who literally lived off the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Porter Wagoner bought his first guitar for $8. The way he paid for that guitar was he trapped rabbits and sold the rabbit skins and saved up $8.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His family fell on hard times, and they had to auction the farm. So they had to move into the city, the city of West Plains, MO, where Porter Wagoner got a job at the butcher shop. The butcher heard Porter Wagoner playing that $8 guitar he had gotten from Montgomery Ward and asked him to sing in the commercials for his butcher shop on the radio--and a star was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After he began singing in the commercials for the butcher shop, they eventually then put him on the radio to sing the advertisements in an area where people in Springfield, MO--the big city of Springfield--heard Porter Wagoner singing in those butcher shop advertisements, and he moved to a station in Springfield, MO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1952, he signed a record contract with Steve Sholes, the very same RCA producer who signed Elvis Presley 3 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1953, Porter Wagoner spent $350 to buy his first extravagant rhinestone-studded creation that he became known for. He always had these incredible outfits that were very sparkly and always involved a wagon wheel and maybe had one of his signature items, which was the fact he had put, in rhinestones, on the inside lining of the coat, in great big letters: "Hi!" So when you would meet Porter Wagoner, he would flash his jacket, and this friendly "Hi!" would beam out at you. He ended up buying  over 50 of these outfits, and they epitomized the style we affectionately call "hillbilly deluxe." They cost anywhere from $8,000 to $12,000 apiece.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had many successes. He had many ups and downs in his life. In fact, recently a record was made that talked about the time he was receiving help for his mental issues in a hospital and how he went long periods of time without recording. But through the years, he had 29 top 10 hits, including "Green, Green Grass of Home," "Skid Row Joe," and "The Cold Hard Facts of Life."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was this young blonde who he made famous. He asked her to come and sing with him on his show. It is now well known who that young blonde was because that, in fact, was Dolly Parton. If it were not for Porter Wagoner, Dolly Parton maybe never would have gotten the chance she needed to catapult her into the culture of country music in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He never had the kind of fancy success that many of our stars have today, but he was like country music. His life went up and down, with very hard beginnings in terms of what he came from. He achieved great success and had low moments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But through it all, his style was very simple--a very simple country music style.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, it was very common for him to use the talking style where he would stop singing and actually talk through a song, telling the story, weaving the tale, tying the threads together, so the listeners, before the song was over, not only found themselves tapping their toe or smiling, but they would find that the heartstrings were being pulled. They would have an emotional connection to Porter Wagoner's music and the lyrics he considered so important to the essence of country music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know everyone in Missouri will miss Porter Wagoner. We have tributes to a lot of people on this floor. I know the people in West Plains, MO, are so proud of him. In fact, I say to the Presiding Officer, right now, if you traveled with me to West Plains, MO, and we turned onto the main drag, you would look at the street sign, and it would be named nothing other than "Porter Wagoner Boulevard."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had a band called the Wagonmasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight in Missouri--all across rural Missouri and in the urban areas of Kansas City and St. Louis--all the country music fans are proud of the fact he was one of Missouri's own. Not only will country music miss him, we will miss him in Missouri and what he has meant to our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
