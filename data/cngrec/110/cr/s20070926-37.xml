  <narrative>HONORING AUDREY KIRKPATRICK -- (Senate - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12138">S12138</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor Audrey Kirkpatrick, one of South Dakota's 2007 Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's Angels in Adoption Award recipients. Audrey has worked with Catholic Social Services in Rapid City, SD for 30 years, exhibiting empathy and dedication to birth families, adoptive parents, and adoptees. I am pleased to recognize Audrey for her years of service, and extend my congratulations to her on this special occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Audrey was among the first social workers employed by Catholic Social Services in Rapid City when she began her work with pregnancy counseling and infant adoption in 1977. She remained with the agency until November 2002. At that time, Audrey believed the time had come for her to retire. However, when the program director of the agency resigned, Audrey was called upon to return to Catholic Social Services and fill in the gap during that critical time, despite suffering from ongoing health problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Audrey continues to be active in the agency on a part-time basis, and is often tapped by other social workers to answer questions, direct people to resources, and provide ideas on how to continue expanding and fulfilling the agency's mission to facilitate the adoption process, in addition to her role working directly with families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stories of Audrey's intense commitment abound. She has been available to families 24 hours a day, going so far as to venture out in the middle of the night to help a young birth mother whose car had broken down. On another occasion, she was present for a reunion of a birth mother and adult son, who she had helped to place in adoption as a child. The mother offered her thanks to Audrey, who had been such a comforting presence at the beginning and end of the adoption experience. It is not uncommon  for people to come back to the agency to express their gratitude to Audrey, even years after she helped them through the adoption process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Audrey is truly an Angel in Adoption. Her contributions to the communities of western South Dakota are inestimable. In the words of one of her coworkers, "I can say with confidence that the gift Audrey offered to these individuals is stronger than words can express. Dedication, alone, cannot describe it." Audrey is beyond a doubt deserving of recognition for her commitment to ensuring that countless children in South Dakota have loving families and safe homes. It is clear that Audrey's legacy  will be one of compassion and caring.</paragraph>
