    <bill type="hr" number="467">H. Res. 467</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas, on May 30, 2007, the leadership of the University and College Union (UCU) of the United Kingdom voted in favor of a motion to consider at the branch level a boycott of Israeli faculty and academic institutions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the UCU was created in 2006 out of a merger of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) and the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas both AUT (in 2005) and NATFHE (in 2006) have passed resolutions supporting a boycott of Israeli academics and academic institutions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, however, the AUT boycott resolution was overturned after one month in a revote, and the NATFHE boycott resolution was voided when the two organizations merged into the UCU;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Britain's National Union of Journalists called for a boycott of Israeli goods in April 2007;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the UCU boycott motion appears to have spawned similar movements in Britain to boycott Israel economically and culturally, and the country's largest labor union, UNISON, said it would follow the union of university instructors in weighing punitive measures against Israel;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these unions have a hypocritical double standard in condemning Israel, a free and democratic state, while completely ignoring gross human rights abuses occurring throughout the Middle East and around the world;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Article 19, section 2, of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that, "Everyone shall have the right to . . . receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these and other attempts to stifle intellectual freedom through the imposition of an academic boycott are morally offensive and contrary to the values of freedom of speech and freedom of inquiry;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas American Nobel laureate Prof. Steven Weinberg refused to participate in a British academic conference due to the National Union of Journalist's boycott and stated that he perceived "a widespread anti-Israel and anti-Semitic current in British opinion"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the senseless boycotting of Israeli academics contributes to the demonization and attempted delegitimization of the State of Israel: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) condemns the vote by the leadership of the University and College Union of May 30, 2007, to consider at the branch level a boycott of Israeli academics and academic institutions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) urges the international scholarly community, the European Union, and individual governments, to reject, or continue to oppose vigorously, calls for an academic boycott of Israel;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) urges educators and governments throughout the world, especially democratically-elected governments, to reaffirm the importance of academic freedom;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) urges other unions and organizations to reject the troubling and disturbing actions of the UCU leadership; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) urges the general members of the UCU to reject the call of the union's leadership to boycott Israel.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first express our great appreciation to our colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative PATRICK MURPHY, for introducing this important and timely measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on May 30, the University and College Union of the United Kingdom voted to urge its membership to boycott Israeli faculty in academic institutions, an extraordinary action by men and women of letters in a free society and the belief in academic freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Murphy's resolution today voices the extreme disapproval of the United States Congress of the Union's shortsighted, simpleminded and singularly  offensive action. What the University and College Union has done flies in the face of the very values that define democracies and are critical to their success, freedom of inquiry and freedom of speech, or freedom to disagree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the University and College Union follows through with this boycott, it will also spark numerous individual and institutional boycotts against British academics and others who likewise have similar values. An academic boycott is a blatant effort to stifle free thinking and debate, the hallmarks of a democratic society. From any point of view, it is wrong. Only in the most extreme moral exigencies would I find the need to take such an action and for such an action to be acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In this particular instance, however, it seems outright wrong. By singling out the conduct of Israel, which is a democratic and pluralistic society surrounded by states with many charges of human rights violations against them, the union's leadership has revealed its true purpose, to demonize Israel. It is simply inexplicable how the union has turned a blind eye to the world's worst violators of human rights and targeted Israel only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If anything, Israeli universities are one of the few places in the world where one will find Jews and Arabs learning side by side. The union's selective sympathy demonstrates a profound ignorance of Israel's academic community and the threats that the country faces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having personally visited Israel and its academic institutions, I can tell you that Jews and Arabs do study side by side, and the good news is that they learn, and they learn from each other, and out of that comes positive reaction to the conflicts of the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The events of this past month in the Gaza Strip in which Hamas lay waste to the legitimate institutions of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza further underscore the profound misjudgment of union leaders to narrowly condemn Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University and College Union of the United Kingdom has thus far chosen to ignore these developments and instead focused its wrath on Israel's ongoing efforts to defend itself against Hamas and other terrorists. If the union truly cared about helping Palestinians, it would help nurture dialogue among Israeli and Palestinian academics and come to the resolution that the two states must live side by side, and Israel has a right to exist. It would support institutions that help to develop, not  stunt the educational sector for Israelis and Palestinians. And most importantly, it would condemn Hamas and others that repeatedly hijack and sabotage any possibility of a lasting two-state solution to the conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By blaming the victims for the terrorists' crimes, the union's actions represent a bizarre inversion of the most fundamental principles of human rights. People of conscience have no choice but to speak out against this hypocrisy. In the face of terror and those who are morally blind to it, we must stand up for the values we cherish: openness, dialogue, democracy and freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Mr. Murphy's legislation is so important, and that is why I call upon all of my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 467, which condemns the decision by the leadership of the University and College Union of the United Kingdom to support a boycott of Israeli academia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the first time, Madam Speaker, that we have faced such a challenge from the fringes of this academic establishment. In fact, on May 29, 2006, the British National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education falsely accused Israel and the Government of Israel of practicing what they said was "apartheid policies" and adopted a resolution to boycott the faculty of Israel and its academic institutions that do not denounce these nonexistent policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A similar resolution in favor again of an academic boycott of Israel was passed by the British Association of University Teachers, AUT, in April 2005, and then rescinded 1 month later by a special council of the AUT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, Madam Speaker, mainstream academics within the United Kingdom and internationally rejected these tragic and derisive attempts to undermine the principles of academic freedom and the free State of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, Madam Speaker, Israel is the strongest ally of the United States and a true democratic partner in the Middle East, one which upholds the principles and values of academic freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The boycotting of Israeli academics only serves to demonize the State of Israel. Moreover, the boycott of academic institutions from democratic countries represents a dangerous assault on the principles of academic freedom and open exchanges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representatives of the British Government, as well as many university presidents, academic bodies and leading scholars in the United States and Great Britain, have repeatedly spoken out against such campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially wish to highlight the strong voice of support from Donna Shalala, the President of the University of Miami in my congressional district, in favor of this resolution. Let us aid the efforts of these distinguished scholars and officials by passing this critical resolution before us tonight and demonstrating to the world that the United States Congress believes in free minds and free countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my distinguished colleagues and friends, Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania and Mr. Burton of Indiana, for introducing this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it gives me particular pleasure to introduce and to yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from the Eighth District of Pennsylvania, Representative PATRICK J. MURPHY, a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a veteran of the Iraq war. I believe this may be his first legislative initiative, and we yield to him 6 minutes as we congratulate him for his leadership.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412233" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Texas for her leadership on this issue and the gentlelady from Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer a resolution to let the world know that this House stands opposed to anti-Semitism and reaffirms our support for academic freedom. It is sad that in this day and age I would have to offer such a resolution, but the actions of a misguided group thousands of miles away have forced this body to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in May the leadership of the University and College Union, or UCU, the main union representing 120,000 British college teachers, called for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. As a former professor myself at the United States Military Academy at West Point, I know how wrong this action is from an academic and diplomatic perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This boycott will sever academic contacts and exchanges of personnel between British and Israeli academic institutions, as well as have a significant economic impact, given that the union enjoys significant influence in Britain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reasons given by the leadership of the UCU for endorsing a boycott consist of the same tired propaganda and inflammatory rhetoric typically used by the enemies of Israel and do not deserve to be repeated on the floor of this distinguished body. This call for a boycott by the UCU is even more disturbing, given that Britain's National Union of Journalists called for a similar boycott this past April.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should come as no surprise that these boycotts have drawn harsh criticism. In a recent editorial entitled "Malicious Boycotts," the New York Times called them nonsense, writing, and I quote, "Who would respect the judgment of a scholar who selects or rejects colleagues on political grounds? Who would trust the dispatches of a reporter who has openly engaged against one side of a conflict? Critical thinking and well thought-out criticism are intrinsic to good scholarship and good journalism.  These boycotts represent neither."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The criticism, though, does not end there. Now former Prime Minister  Tony Blair has criticized the boycott saying, "I hope very much that decision is overturned because it does absolutely no good for the peace process or for relations in that part of the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the former Prime Minister is right. We need to build dialogue and trust in the Middle East and we cannot do that without our greatest ally there, the State of Israel. Israel is a stable democracy that shares our values. This is rare in a region of the world where few nations have democracy, rule of law and religious freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an Iraq war veteran, I know firsthand just how dangerous that part of the world truly is. That's why when Israel comes under attack from hatemongers, it's the American values that are also under such attack. Today, by passing this bipartisan resolution, we're stating with one voice that this Congress will stand up and defend our friend, the State of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, my resolution condemns the decision by the UCU leadership to boycott Israeli academia and urges the general membership to reject the boycott. It also urges the academic community and individual governments to reject any call for a boycott of Israel and to reaffirm the importance of academic freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Limiting academic exchange and shrinking the marketplace of ideas only hinders our ability to bring peace to the Middle East and to help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to make sure that I thank some of my distinguished colleagues who were instrumental in bringing this resolution to the floor today; the chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe, ROBERT WEXLER; and the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, TOM LANTOS; and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. These three distinguished Members have proven themselves to be leaders in standing up for Israel, and I thank them for all their work in bringing  this resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Speaker, I will conclude by urging swift passage of this critical resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I'd like to congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania for this very important resolution, and I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me add my appreciation to Congressman Murphy for a powerful statement on the floor in affirmation of the sense of responsibility involving academic freedom and the important responsibility in opposition to anti-Semitism that seems to plague this world on many occasions. Let me thank him for his leadership, thank Mr. Burton and thank the ranking member and the chairman of the full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I ask my colleagues, with great enthusiasm, to support this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Anti-Israel propaganda has reached a new low, with a renewed campaign by a group of British academics to boycott Israeli academics and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spearheaded by the British University and College Union, the initiative calls on British academics to refrain from collaborating on research with Israeli counterparts or working with journals published by Israeli companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is incumbent upon the United States to oppose this assault on academic freedom and stand against efforts to isolate Israeli institutions. While I am encouraged that there is little support for this initiative beyond a vocal and extreme minority, it appears that similar undertakings have been attempted by British unions representing journalists and government workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I welcome the bold statements by the UK Education Minister and university presidents across the United States condemning this misguided crusade. Those who sincerely believe in the cause of peace should encourage dialogue, cooperation, and the free exchange of ideas. It is disappointing that the Palestinian trade unions promoting these kinds of boycotts are more interested in promoting prejudice than in building a future of coexistence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this resolution, let us raise our voices in solidarity with Israel and reaffirm the fundamental values of academic freedom.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, academic freedom is one of the bedrocks of a free society. This is known in the United Kingdom, just as it is known in the United States and other democratic nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the nations with an open academic climate is the democratic state of Israel. The views expressed on its campuses span the spectrum from left to right and liberal to conservative. Its students are of all ethnicities, speaking many different languages. But, on May 30, the University and College Union of the United Kingdom voted to urge its membership to consider boycotting Israeli faculty and academic institutions. This deplorable action by men and women of letters runs against the very tenets  of free academic exploration. How can people of learning expect to share the studies of the great questions of our time if they are not speaking to one another?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, I fear that the reason behind this extraordinary step is much more dark and ominous. I believe that underlying this attack on Israel's academia is a not-so-well-veiled anti-Semitism. By singling out the conduct of Israel, a democratic and pluralistic country surrounded by a sea of dictatorships, the Union's leadership has taken absurdity and hypocrisy to new heights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation on the floor of the House today voices Congress's extreme disapproval of the Union's short-sighted, bigoted, and offensive action. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="467">H. Res. 467</bill> and tell the nations of the world that academic societies are no places for closed-minded, hate-filled efforts to stifle free exchange.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400623" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="467">H.R. 467</bill>, condemning the appalling and frightful decision by the University and College Union of the United Kingdom to support a boycott of Israel academia. I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative PATRICK MURPHY, for his leadership in this critical issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University and College Union of the United States made the determination to boycott Israel based on a biased, ignorant, and destructive targeting of the State of Israel, the only free and democratic country in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The UCU's vote to freeze European funding for Israeli academic institutions, as well as condemning "the complicity of Israeli academia in the occupation," is disgraceful. The Union's discriminatory actions echo the anti-Semitic rhetoric that has reverberated throughout history and alarmingly, as the UCU vote attests, is still with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the UCU boycott strips the principle of academic freedom from one of the world's most established democracies, undermining the academic dialogue and exchange of ideas that foster and sustain intellectual pursuit. These senseless initiatives only defame the reputation of British academics as they violate fundamental standards of academic freedom by censuring the only country in the Middle East where open scholarship and debate are not only allowed, but encouraged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress, serving a nation founded on the ideals of democracy and freedom, I urge my fellow Members to support <bill type="h" number="467">H.R. 467</bill>, condemning the decision by the University and College Union of the United Kingdom to support a boycott of Israeli academia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400311" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise with serious concerns over this legislation. Let me first state that I am personally not in favor of the University and College Union of the United Kingdom boycott against Israeli academia. I oppose all such refusals to engage and interact even where strong disagreement exists. I believe such blockades, be they against countries or academic groups, to be counterproductive. I strongly encourage academic and cultural exchanges, as they are the best way to foster  international understanding and prevent wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concerns are about this particular piece of legislation, however. I simply do not understand why it is the business of the United States Congress--particularly considering the many problems we have at home and with U.S. policy abroad--to bring the weight of the U.S. government down on an academic disagreement half a world away. Do we really believe that the U.S. Government should be sticking its nose into a dispute between British and Israeli academics? Is there no dispute in no remote corner  of the globe in which we don't feel the need to become involved?</paragraph>
