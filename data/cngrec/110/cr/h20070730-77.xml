    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 49, introduced by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones), my good friend and colleague on the House Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution honors the men and women in the Armed Forces who have demonstrated selfless and heroic acts on the field of battle. They are recipients of the Purple Heart. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution that so rightly honors those in uniform who sacrifice so much for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year marks the 75th anniversary of a medal awarded to soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors who have been wounded or killed by an enemy in combat. To date, over 1.5 million members of the Armed Forces have been awarded the Purple Heart, or its predecessor, the Badge of Military Merit, in conflicts spanning from the Civil War to the present-day Operation Iraqi Freedom and the war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Purple Heart was revived in 1932 on the 200th anniversary of President George Washington's birth. Originally awarded only to Army soldiers in 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt extended the honor to all military services. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy extended the honor to civilians working alongside the military in the time of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Purple Heart is recognized as the oldest military honor in the United States that is still in use and the first to be given to any soldier who is wounded or killed by an enemy of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Faced with situations from which most people would shrink, our Nation's warriors have gone boldly into battle and met democracy's enemies with a fierce commitment to protect those liberties that allow all of us to stand here today. They recognized the truth so often overlooked by their fellow citizens: a free Nation requires constant protection and constant protectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in our modern age, complete with all the technology that human intellect can muster, our men and women in the Armed Forces continue to prove that it is selfless and patriotic citizens that must ultimately stand tall to protect our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Formed in 1932, the Military Order of the Purple Heart has the solemn obligation and duty to foster an environment of goodwill among combat-wounded veterans, promote patriotism, support necessary legislative initiatives, and, most importantly, provide service to all veterans and their families. It fulfills this mission through community and volunteer efforts and by employing low-income combat veterans. Their sacrifice and dedication to this country are a testament to the quality of individuals  who volunteer to serve our Nation in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is important that we honor this sacrifice by congratulating the Military Order of the Purple Heart on its 75th anniversary, commend all recipients of the Purple Heart for their courage and sacrifice on behalf of the United States, and encourage all Americans to take time to learn about the Purple Heart and the honor, the courage, and the bravery it symbolizes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to note that the Guam Chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart has been a tremendous community leader for all veterans on Guam. Their voice is heard through representation on the Guam Veterans Advisory Council. Our Guam chapter is also accredited to provide assistance to veterans who are applying for VA benefits. The group has been a critical partner for our Nation's most deserving, and we know that the Military Order of the Purple Heart has stood just as strong in  communities across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Jones, the sponsor, for his leadership in this cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Guam for her very kind remarks and comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of my resolution that honors the Military Order of the Purple Heart on its 75th anniversary. The Purple Heart was originally conceived as the Badge of Military Merit by GEN George Washington on August 7, 1782. However, it had fallen into disuse after the Revolutionary War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The practice of awarding the Purple Heart was revived in 1932, as the gentlewoman said, at the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth. The organization now known as the Military Order of the Purple Heart was also formed in 1932 for the protection and the mutual interest of all who have received the decoration. This year will mark the 75th anniversary of fostering an environment of goodwill and comradery among combat-wounded veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Purple Heart is a combat decoration awarded to Members of the Armed Forces who are wounded by an instrument of war wielded by the enemy and posthumously to the next of kin in the name of members who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 1.5 million Purple Heart medals have been awarded to members of the Armed Forces fighting in defense of freedom and democracy. Today, more than 500,000 recipients of the Purple Heart are still living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By this resolution, Congress congratulates the Military Order of the Purple Heart on its 75th anniversary as a national organization whose goals are to preserve and sustain the honor of the Armed Forces. It strongly commends all recipients of the Purple Heart for their courage and sacrifice. Americans should take time to learn about the Purple Heart and the honor, courage, and bravery it symbolizes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="49">H. Con. Res. 49</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution, as amended, was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>The title was amended so as to read: "Concurrent resolution recognizing the 75th anniversary of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and commending recipients of the Purple Heart for their courage and sacrifice on behalf of the United States.".</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
