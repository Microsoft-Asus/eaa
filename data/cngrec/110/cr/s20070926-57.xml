  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's cooperation. I will say we have a lot to do. It is all up to us when we get it done. I hope it does not spill over into the weekend. If things work out right, we could finish everything tomorrow. We will have to see. But we are going to try to. I know that may be wishful thinking on my part. But we are going to try to get as much done as we can.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It strikes me that there is no good reason why we should not wrap this up tomorrow. I think virtually all of the items left to be dealt with, there is broad agreement on on a bipartisan basis that we ought to pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be working with the majority leader to complete our work for the week at the earliest possible time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, I wish to be able to complete, prior to a week from Friday, the Defense appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to have a run at Commerce-State-Justice, which deals with the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration. I would like to be able to do those two appropriations bills before we leave. We have a tremendous burden to do the rest of the appropriations bills. The House has passed them. It is easier for them to do than us. I have requested that we start our conferences. I want real conferences like we used to have around here when the distinguished Republican leader and I were a  little bit younger, when we actually had conferences where people sat down and talked about different issues. We are going to try to do that and get a number of these done so we can send them to the President. I think that is what will get this program moving along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken to the head of the Office of Management and Budget. Even though he may not be able to agree with what I want, I have found him a person who is agreeable. I talk to him anytime I call him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe we can work our way through this. But we can't do it unless we have bills that are completed that we can send to the President. It is not just going to happen by magic. I personally believe it is not good for this country to have long-standing continuing resolutions. We need to do our job. That is why I hope we can complete our work so next week we can do the appropriations bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the majority leader will yield once again, I concur with the goal of completing those two appropriations bills next week. I will be encouraging everyone on this side to work in a cooperative spirit to achieve the result the majority leader has laid out. It is good for the Senate and good for the country to get this work done. We will be cooperating in every way possible toward that end.</paragraph>
