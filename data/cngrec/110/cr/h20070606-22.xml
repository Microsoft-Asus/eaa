    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Capitol Hill Oceans Week. The President has declared June as Oceans Month, and this Friday will be an international celebration of Oceans Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do we need to pay attention to the oceans? Well, the oceans are dying, and the earth is dependent upon them. We are dumping everything we don't want into the ocean and extracting every living thing we can to eat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've created commissions by Congress and by private trust of the best talent in America to advise Congress on what we should do, and they recommended national ocean governance policies, new policies that can be adopted by this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've introduced that bill, <bill type="h" number="21">H.R. 21</bill>, and as National Oceans Week, Day and Month, I'd like to ask all my colleagues to seriously consider cosponsoring <bill type="h" number="21">H.R. 21</bill>. It provides solutions to the problems of the earth.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
