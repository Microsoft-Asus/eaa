    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor in the Record of the Senate Norm Grayson, an outstanding realtor and a great friend, and to acknowledge a very special occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 15, 2007, Norm will celebrate his 40th year in the real estate business and host a barbeque for hundreds of friends in Oconee County. Although I cannot be there in person, it is a privilege to stand in this Senate and honor this tremendous milestone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Norm and my father Ed were the best of friends. Both men are legends in Georgia real estate. Norm has earned CRS, CCIM, and CRB designations, as well as the Home Builders CBI designation. Among his many achievements, Norm has served as president of the Athens Board of Realtors and the Athens Home Builders Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his outstanding accomplishments and commitment to the highest ethical standards, Norm was named Realtor of the Year by the Georgia Association of Realtors in 1980. The Georgia Association of Realtors also honored him in 1987 with its President's Award and the Athens Board of Realtors recognized Norm in 1996 with its Lifetime Meritorious Service Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Norm and his lovely wife Faye are great Georgians and wonderful friends. Norm is a class act who is well loved in work and at home. It gives me a great deal of pleasure, and it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the United States Senate the contributions of Norm Grayson to the real estate industry and the State of Georgia. He is an inspiration.</paragraph>
