    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill>, as introduced by our colleague from California (Mrs. Bono), is to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in an important water supply project for Southern Riverside County in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill> authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Rancho California Water District, to participate in the design, planning and construction of permanent facilities for water recycling, demineralization, desalination and distribution of non-potable water supplies in Southern Riverside County. When completed, the project will significantly enhance scarce water resources in Rancho California by quadrupling recycled water supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill> seeks to help communities in Southern Riverside County as they try to drought-proof their water supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill>, introduced by our colleague, MARY BONO of California, authorizes funds to complete a three-stage plan for water recycling in Riverside County, California, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would help ease the county's dependency on imported water and will help drought-proof this arid region of southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlelady from California (Mrs. Bono).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400039" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would first like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young for their support of <bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill>, the Rancho California Water District, or RCWD, Recycled Water Reclamation Facility Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the speed with which they were able to move this bill through regular order, with the help of Subcommittee Chairman Napolitano and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, we are now able to consider this legislation in the full House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill>, which I introduced in March of this year, authorizes funding to begin implementation of the RCWD regional Integrated Resources Plan. The legislation directly affects water usage for an area of the Nation that continues to experience rapid population growth. Riverside County, where RCWD operates, is California's fourth largest county and experienced a population increase of 76 percent from 1980 to 1990. By the year 2000, this county's population was at over 1.5 million  residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, RCWD serves the City of Temecula, parts of the City of Murrieta and the surrounding area, which is represented by both myself and Congressman DARRELL ISSA. Southwest Riverside County continues to grow quickly, with numerous military families and those who commute to both Los Angeles and San Diego. Coupled with this residential growth, the area is also home to a strong agricultural industry. Citrus, avocados and wine grape fields dot the area and bring with them jobs, crop  revenues and, not to mention, some extremely good wine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill> also enjoys the support from the surrounding water districts, including Eastern and Western Municipal Water Districts and Metropolitan  Water District, which provides drinking water to nearly 18 million people throughout southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funding authorized in my legislation will take significant steps toward enacting the Integrated Resource Plan that has a total cost of around $103 million. The results of this plan are primarily three things: an expansion of local recycled water resources; a dependable conversion of water used in the agriculture sector to a recycled and raw water system; and a facility to desalinate recycled water for agricultural use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Put in more simple terms, the benefits to the area are clear: As this part of Riverside County continues to see more residential growth, the IRP project will free up enough treated water to supply up to 70,000 households. The capability to reuse over 16,000 acre-feet of recycled water will be in place, keeping the local agricultural sector vibrant and maximizing local water storage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to note that, in May, the local water districts completed a year-long feasibility study which, in part, indicated a gross savings of $789 million in purchased water costs over the 30 years after the project is completed. The savings to the area and modernization of local water infrastructure is something crucial for this part of my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the value of thoughtful water usage in this area of southern California is extremely high. The strong support this legislation received within the Natural Resources Committee shows a bipartisan understanding other Members have of improving water delivery to both residential and agricultural users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I would like to thank the chairman, the ranking member, their staff, and my own Chris Foster, for all of their help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for the support of Members from both sides of the aisle on <bill type="h" number="1725">H.R. 1725</bill>, the legislation I'm proud to have authored.</paragraph>
