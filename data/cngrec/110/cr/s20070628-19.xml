    <paragraph>Madam President, Senator Warner asked earlier today what would happen with the next judge, which is a Virginia judge. It would be my intent--I have to talk to Senator Leahy, and I have a meeting with him this afternoon--that we do that on Monday, the day we get back. We will do the Virginia judge and the remaining district judges. So there will be four votes on the Monday we get back on the district court judges.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, if the leader will yield for a question, those three additional judges you made reference to are the three Michigan district court judges?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is right. That is what we had left on the calendar.</paragraph>
