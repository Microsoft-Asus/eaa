    <paragraph>Madam President, I come today to honor one of the great educational leaders of our time: Dr. Katherine Mitchell of Alabama. Dr. Mitchell is nationally acclaimed for her work in developing the Alabama Reading Initiative, ARI. This scientifically based program has not only been of tremendous benefit to students and teachers in Alabama but also in many other States that have modeled their State reading initiatives after ours. I firmly believe that Dr. Mitchell's work will prove to  be seen as resulting in the most dramatic improvements in student learning in the last 50 years. Recently, the National Association of Educational Progress, NAEP, test scores were released, showing Alabama to be No. 1 in reading improvement for the fourth grade. Between 2005 and 2007, Alabama's fourth graders made a significant</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken with Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings many times about Dr. Mitchell's work and the great things happening in Alabama, and she is ecstatic about the innovative ways Dr. Mitchell and her fabulous team have changed education in Alabama and across the country. I am always impressed with Dr. Mitchell's enthusiasm for her work, and her strong desire to motivate and inspire educators wherever she goes. She is a rare and admirable person, and I applaud the many ways she has touched  the lives of children and families around the world throughout her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to say, and not inappropriate, that Dr. Mitchell is a woman of sincere and strong religious faith and that she has felt that her service is a calling by God. Such a conviction, it is plain to see, has given power to her insight for improving education. An active member of Frazer Memorial United Methodist Church, pastored by the wonderful John Ed Mathison, she is involved in so many good activities, while receiving inspiration that drives her work. I am sorry to say that Dr. Mitchell  is retiring from her position at the Alabama State Department of Education, and I know that this will be a great loss for the State. However, I know Dr. Mitchell too well to ever think that she will be less busy in retirement--she has far too much energy and too much to offer. I</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Dr. Mitchell, for your service. Your shoes cannot be filled, I am sure of it, but I am also sure that the team you have so carefully trained will continue to carry on your vision with the same commitment and passion that you have so admirably displayed.</paragraph>
