    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will take a few short minutes because I know others want to honor Senator Byrd, and there is some other business to discuss. The bill I objected to today comes before us because we have some questions. The chairman of the committee, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, and Senator Snowe, the ranking member, have it right, wanting to help our veterans and to make sure they have great opportunities as they return. But I remind my colleagues that  this last year, in the SBA, we stole $26 million worth of their salaries to run that, to do directed earmarks. So we have this great new leader at the SBA, Steven Preston. Yet we have handcuffed him in his ability to do what he needs to do at the SBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We noticed in the paper yesterday a tremendous, large number of loans where things have been faked. The SBA hadn't had the capability of managing the SBA properly. So our purpose in doing this is not to go against the veterans we see. Nobody stands as a greater supporter than I in terms of protecting their privacy, their second-amendment rights, and honoring them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do want to do this. The offset that is in this bill comes out of a microloan that is also designed to help veterans. So we are taking money from one area and not the other at the same time we are stealing money from the SBA's operational money to do earmarks that don't do anything to help veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My pledge to both Senator Kerry and SNOWE is to look at this and see if we can't come to some resolution about our concerns over the intervening time between now and the time we come back and make a commitment to try to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But most important is, what we want to do is preserve freedom. An ever-encroaching Federal Government does not preserve the very freedom that those veterans fought for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
