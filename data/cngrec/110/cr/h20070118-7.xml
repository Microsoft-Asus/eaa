  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the Democrats' proposed energy bill that would only hurt hardworking Americans through raising taxes, forcing the cost of gas and home heating oil to increase, and inflicting massive job losses as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 109th Congress, I distinctly remember the Democrats continually saying that the Republicans were outsourcing jobs. With increased taxes, many hardworking Americans in the oil industry will lose their jobs to overseas corporations, not only hurting the American worker, but also increasing our Nation's dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not built a refinery in America since 1976, which further has added to our dependence on foreign oil by giving the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, massive control over us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if we want true energy reform, we must begin to build refineries, allow for responsible exploration of energy within our own borders, and invest in energy alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raising taxes, causing job losses and increasing fuel costs are not the answer. If we fail to act in a responsible manner, we are continuing to allow ourselves to be at the mercy of OPEC and the nations that control it.</paragraph>
