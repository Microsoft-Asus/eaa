  <narrative>PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11048]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this evening in strong opposition to the pending Peru Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA promised Americans 200,000 new NAFTA jobs, higher wages and an increasing U.S. trade surplus with Mexico, just to name a few. Now, nearly 15 years later, the evidence shows that NAFTA has failed to make good on its promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, in many areas in which benefits were promised, conditions are worse than before NAFTA went into effect. For example, in direct contradiction to the promises of NAFTA, nearly 1 million jobs were destroyed directly by the NAFTA free trade deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district, in particular, has suffered the loss of 1,600 jobs; and NAFTA forced Maytag to leave Galesburg, Illinois, for Sonora, Mexico. And just last week, it was announced that Carrhart Manufacturing, a clothing company, will cease production and move to Mexico at the end of December.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every aspect of the city of Galesburg is hurting. The economy, the schools, the small businesses that feed into these plants, and the citizens have lost their spirit. Now Galesburg is trying to rebuild its identity, but I fear that the Peru FTA promises more of the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed Peru FTA would replicate, and in some instances expand, on many of the most devastating provisions of the flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model. First, the Peru FTA preserves many of the CAFTA terms providing extreme foreign investor rights. The provisions in the Peru FTA allow foreign investors to skirt U.S. courts and laws and give foreign investors the authority to sue the United States Government in foreign tribunals for violating their FTA-granted rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the Peru Free Trade Agreement includes the NAFTA-CAFTA procurement chapters on Buy America and anti-offshoring policies. The FTA requires foreign firms be treated the same as American firms seeking government contracts, challenging our right to invest tax dollars into American jobs and businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several groups have publicly opposed the Peru FTA for those very reasons, including the two largest trade unions in Peru.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The September 17 Change to Win Coalition letter states: "Chapters of the Bush-negotiated FTA that literally replicate job-killing aspects of the core NAFTA-CAFTA model have not been addressed. Not one word was changed from the Bush-negotiated text."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Interfaith Working Group on Trade and Investment released a statement saying: "Based on our experience with NAFTA and CAFTA, the U.S.-Peru FTA will cause lost livelihoods in rural communities, reduce access to life-saving medication and perpetuate the global `race to the bottom' for workers and environmental protection."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to make matters worse, no one seems to have faith in this President to  enforce the labor standards negotiated in the May 10 agreement. This administration cannot and will not enforce American worker safety right here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a statement released on May 11, AFL-CIO President, John Sweeney, reminded us of the Bush administration's past failures by saying: "The Bush violations against nations like Jordan and China remind us there is no guarantee the executive branch will enforce any new rights workers may gain through these negotiations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The machinists labor union echoed Mr. Sweeney's statement in a letter to Congress dated August 2. It states: "We are well aware of this administration's dismal record when it comes to workers' rights. For example, it has refused to issue a trade complaint against China for workers' rights violations described fully in AFL-CIO submissions. Given its past record, we fear that this administration will simply ignore even the most egregious labor violations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I received a letter from two Peruvian labor federations concerned about the labor provisions in the pending FTA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our trade policies must start to serve the interests of America's working families and workers around the globe. We can do better. We need to overhaul our trade readjustment program. We need to calculate the loss of American jobs when this bill goes into effect, and we need to remember that our majority is here because working men and women demanded that we look out for them and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's slow down, vote "no" on this trade deal, and stand up to those people who stood up for us. That, Madam Speaker, is the very least that we can do. I urge my colleagues to please vote "no" on the Peru agreement.</paragraph>
