    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call the attention of the Congress to a very serious problem that is affecting our magnificent Great Lakes, and that is historic low lake levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as we are seeing low lake and water levels around other parts of the country, the Great Lakes, which, remember, comprise actually one-fifth or fully 20 percent of the fresh water supply of the entire world, are losing water at alarming rates. And these low lake levels are having a significantly negative impact on millions that live in the Great Lakes Basin who make their living on the lakes or simply use them to recreate on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, millions of recreational boaters are running aground or they can't keep their boats in marinas. Lake freighters are not being able to load up the way that they need to because the low lake levels are causing untold millions of dollars of losses for the shipping industry, and the very fragile environmental habitats of many species of fish and waterfowl and other species have been negatively impacted as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, much of what is happening to the Great Lakes can be attributed certainly to weather changes. We have had some warmer winters. Therefore, you have less ice cover so evaporation is occurring all year long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this Congress considers funding for other national environmental treasures, let us remember our magnificent Great Lakes.</paragraph>
