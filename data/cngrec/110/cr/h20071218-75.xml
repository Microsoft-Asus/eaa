  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Love conquers all. And I rise today, Madam Speaker, to join the celebration, for although we mourn, we celebrate the life of JULIA CARSON, and celebrate we must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm delighted to have listened to my colleagues in the Special Order led by Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES and to hear my friends and colleagues from Indiana. But for a moment I offer my sympathy to those of JULIA CARSON's district, to the good people of Indianapolis, to the good people of Indiana, and, yes, to the American people. For JULIA CARSON truly represented and will be remembered as an American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that JULIA would not mind our recalling for our colleagues why she was so keenly committed to those who could not speak for themselves and could not help themselves. For JULIA CARSON's history, by its very nature, directed her into the fight for  those who, like herself, grew up with very little, but yet could look to this great country and actually believe that they could achieve their dreams. For JULIA was born to a teenage  mother, and that, from the time that she was born in the late 1930s, going into the early 1940s and World War II, was a struggle and an unsurmountable task in and of itself. They had to struggle together. JULIA CARSON herself raised two children as a divorcee. So first of all, she understood what a single parent, a mother with two children, had to overcome to make sure that those children saw in themselves and saw in her a future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's likely that she was already destined for public service, and so by finding Andy Jacobs, her finding him and as well his finding her, it was a match made in heaven. But she stopped along the wayside to give support and comfort to workers, United Auto Workers, and understood what it meant, a hard day's work for a good day's pay. So early on she was on the battlefield, and her time in respective legislative bodies only spoke to her continued desire to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I like something about JULIA and I like something about the description of her. And my good friend and colleague from Indiana, Congressman Hill, just said a liberal in Indianapolis. I ask the question how you can walk around in Indiana and call yourself liberal and be victorious. That was JULIA. Love conquers all, the love that she had for her people, but the love that they had for her stood largely to embrace her and surround her with armor against those who would  try to do her political harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was fascinated in listening to the Congressmen speak of the vigil. Can you imagine people just gathering out of pain and joy, the pain of possibly losing Congresswoman Carson, but also the joy of having her. Going to her house. Now, we are the people's House. So Members of Congress are exposed and people know all about them. But can you imagine people feeling so comfortable that they would come to her block and just stand in silence or singing or praying or testifying just to say,  We want to be near her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a moving expression that must have been, and I'm so sorry that I missed it. But it was a showing of their own appreciation for her resilience, her astuteness, and her ability to be underestimated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went to Indianapolis, and it was that first year, her reelection after her first term, Madam Speaker, and yes, they were all out. And it was the year of the targets, it was the year of impeachment here in this body, and people were not feeling good, they were feeling ugly. And the right wing, as it could be defined, and I don't say it in a partisan way, but the guys who were trying to get her in reelection came up with all kinds of things. Soft on crime, they accused her of, a number of issues  that they thought would get her unelected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I'll tell you, she had a good history with the people of Indianapolis. In fact, she even had some conservatives supporting her. Why? Because she was truthful in her belief for social services. But she also came up with the idea that welfare recipients should work for their benefits. I'm sure it was crafted around giving them hope and giving them goals and giving them the ability to believe that they could succeed, but she was applauded for that. And she was called a person who wrestled  a problem to the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I close by simply saying that we have lost a warrior, a soldier on the battlefield, but tonight we celebrate her life. My sympathy to her family. And thank you, JULIA, for being our friend and my friend.</paragraph>
