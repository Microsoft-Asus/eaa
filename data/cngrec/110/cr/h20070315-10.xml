    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today once again to state my strong support for comprehensive immigration reform. Last week, Federal agents from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raided businesses in my district in southern Arizona because employers were suspected of employing illegal immigrants. For years, we have known that employers in Arizona and across the country have been breaking the law by illegally employing undocumented workers. Let me be clear: any company that knowingly hires  illegal immigrants should be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the humanitarian concerns that are involved when raids on businesses occur, especially regarding families. The problems of immigration are extensive. These raids make clear that in my district in Arizona we continue to bear the brunt of a national crisis. Approximately 4,000 illegal immigrants pass into Arizona each and every day. That is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to rise to the challenge and address a national crisis. We need to do it now. Democrats and Republicans working together must pass comprehensive immigration reform.</paragraph>
