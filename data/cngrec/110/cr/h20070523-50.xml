    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of Jack Borman. In a few days, Jack will be retiring from the Kenton County Sheriff's Department, and I  think this is the ideal time to honor his dedication and lifetime of service to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a young man from Silver Grove, Kentucky, Jack joined the military and was deployed to fight in the Korean War. He bravely fought in missions at Triangle Hill, in Operation Smack and in the now infamous battle at Pork Chop Hill. For his bravery and valor at the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, one of the most deadly battles of the Korean War, he was awarded the Silver Star and a Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, MGM Studios released a film about this battle, and Jack added movie star to his long list of lifetime accomplishments. From fighting in Korea to serving Kenton County, he has selflessly served and protected us. Jack, we thank you for your service and wish you much success in your retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack is a busy grandfather to 19 grandchildren. I'm sure his life will continue to be a great adventure. For all that, thank you for your service.</paragraph>
