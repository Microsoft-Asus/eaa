    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>, the Violent Radicalization of Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May, six men were arrested for allegedly plotting to attack Fort Dix. Three of those men were United States citizens; the other three had been in the United States since they were small children. Then, again, in June, another four men were charged with plotting to attack JFK Airport by blowing up jet fuel tanks. The alleged mastermind of this plot was a United States citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, one of the most frequently visited English language Web sites that preaches hate, violence and radicalized views of Islam is operated by a 21-year-old U.S. citizen from the comfort of his parents' home in North Carolina. Some may say these incidents are isolated cases, but I believe that they are indicative of a growing trend of homegrown terrorism in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homegrown terrorists no longer need to travel to Afghanistan or Pakistan to get support and training. They can simply go on the Internet to find violent propaganda and others who share their violent ideology. <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> provides us with a strategy for how to address this very challenging Homeland Security issue. I commend Chairwoman Harman for authoring this important legislation and for championing this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The centerpiece of this bill is the creation of a national commission. It is a step in the right direction. National commissions have a long and successful history in this country. The Gilmore Commission, of which our chairwoman was a member, which functioned from 1993 to 1998, made 164 recommendations regarding the domestic response to terrorism. Of those 164 recommendations, all have been adopted in whole or in part by the Congress and the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another commission, the National Commission on Terrorism, which operated in the early 1990s, was on the cutting edge of the terrorism debate. That commission provided the Nation with the blueprint of how to address the threat of terrorism long before the September 11 attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The more recent 9/11 Commission set the tenor of our administrative and legislative response to the September 11 attack. That commission's recommendations were the bedrock of legislation I offered that was enacted into law this summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission established in <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> will help build on the work of past commissions and help our Nation come up with strategies for new threats. The bill also requires our government to reach out to other nations that have experienced home grown terrorism. Learning from other nations about what works and what doesn't will better position us to prevent the spread of violent ideology in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also creates a center of excellence to conduct research that is desperately needed in determining the root cause of violent radicalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> also protects simple rights and liberties of U.S. citizens. The bill is mindful of Americans' right to free speech, freedom of association and freedom to worship. <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> makes certain that individuals exercising these rights within lawful parameters are not singled out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important Homeland Security bill and ask them to vote in favor of passage of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400660" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the ranking member on the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, I would like to commend, first of all and especially, Chairwoman JANE HARMAN, who has, as the chairman says, Mr. Thompson, really done a lot of work in this area and has been at the forefront of our intelligence community in working to protect our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the full committee chairman, Mr. Thompson of Mississippi, for all his hard work, and our ranking member, Mr. King of New York, who could not be here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This truly has been a bipartisan effort. It's one of those issues that all of us in this body recognize as so critical to the protection of our citizens and our country. This legislation is focused on addressing the issue of radicalization and homegrown terrorism. While terrorist recruitment and radicalization is a worldwide problem that must be combated globally, the United States cannot afford to simply focus on eliminating terrorists abroad. It is essential that we fully understand the future  and the nature of the threat here in the United States from homegrown radicals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the National Intelligence Estimate on the Terrorist Threat to the U.S. Homeland released in July of this year, the Director of National Intelligence and the National Intelligence Council assess, "The spread of radical Internet sites, increasingly aggressive anti-U.S. rhetoric and actions, and the growing number of radical, self-generating cells in Western countries indicate that the radical and violent segment of the West's Muslim population is expanding, including in the United States. The  arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States--who are becoming more connected ideologically, virtually, and/or in a physical sense to the global extremist movement--points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the freedoms of our society, and the interconnected world we live in, radical ideas spread easily. These ideas can come from overseas or from within the United States. They can come from within prisons inside of isolated religious or ethnic enclaves or on the Internet. These ideas reach people in the privacy of their homes, via the Internet, and can be similarly assessed by vulnerable individuals at schools, libraries and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our freedoms are being abused by individuals whose sole purpose is to destroy our way of life. While we have not seen radicalization to the extent witnessed in other Western countries like the United Kingdom, we have seen homegrown terrorist cells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prisoners in Sacramento state prison plotted to attack Jewish and U.S. military targets. Radicalized individuals plotted to destroy fuel tanks at JFK Airport in New York and aimed to create carnage at Fort Dix in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While clearly law enforcement and intelligence efforts are key to intercepting and interdicting these ideas and thoughts and efforts in our country, we need a strategy to ensure that  violent, radical ideologies are contained. Because of the nature of this threat, it is essential that we understand why individuals become radicalized and what we can do to prevent radical ideologies from taking hold and spreading here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> establishes a National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Ideologically Based Violence. The commission incorporates aspects of <bill type="h" number="1695">H.R. 1695</bill>, the PREVENT Act, which I introduced earlier this year. The purpose of this national commission would be to proactively get ahead of the radicalization problems so that as a Nation we can combat these radical ideologies before they become widespread within our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> includes provisions to help us learn from our international partners on how they are trying to prevent radicalization in their own countries. This issue is not new to many countries throughout the world such as the United Kingdom, and I believe it is critical for us to work with our international partners and learn from their past successes and failures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Lastly, this legislation includes provisions that ensure privacy and civil rights are protected for all American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to commend Chairman Harman and Chairman Thompson for working with me and Mr. King on this legislation. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400166" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding to me, and I thank my ranking member, Mr. Reichert, for his generous remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on 9/11 we were attacked by foreigners who had come to this country legally. The next time and, sadly, I believe there will be a next time, my assumption is that many who attack us will already be here, and some will be U.S. citizens. Homegrown terror is a phenomenon many countries are scrambling to understand, including the British, as they are under major threat from it. Theirs is a peculiar kind with a large Pakistani population that is not well assimilated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But America has a problem too, unique in nature, and we fail to understand it at our peril. Far from being immune to the danger of homegrown terror, think Timothy McVeigh or Theodore Kaczynski, the threat today is infinitely greater and more likely to be influenced by events in the Middle East or by the larger struggle against radical Islam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What causes an individual or group to, first, coalesce around a set of radical principles or a charismatic leader, activities permitted by our Bill of Rights, but subsequently to embrace a violent agenda intended to inflict maximum pain and disruption on his neighbors, potential treason, is not well understood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent testimony before our Intelligence Subcommittee, some common traits and characteristics emerged. Said RAND Corporation's Bruce Jenkins: "It is the same age group that is susceptible to being recruited into gangs. These are young men who are going through identity crises, looking to define themselves. If you have a narrative that exalts violence, that attempts to project that violence as a personal obligation, that offers the tantalizing prospect of clandestinity, identity, all of those  are appealing to that specific age group."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Combine that personal adolescent upheaval with the explosion of information technologies and communications tools, tools which American kids are using to broadcast messages from al Qaeda, as Chairman Thompson just said, and there is a road map to terror, a retail outlet for anger and warped aspirations. Link that intent with a trained terrorist operative who has actual capability, and a "Made in the USA" suicide bomber is born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> was carefully constructed by DAVE REICHERT and me, as ranking member and chairman of the Homeland Security Intelligence Subcommittee. The bill passed out of subcommittee and full committee unanimously. This bill has strong bipartisan origins. As one who believes that this body's best work is done on a bipartisan basis, I think this bill is a testament. Though not a silver bullet, the legislation will help the Nation develop a better understanding of the forces  that lead to homegrown terrorism and the steps we can take to stop it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, free speech, espousing even very radical beliefs, is protected by our Constitution. But violent behavior is not. Our plan must be to intervene before a person crosses that line separating radical views from violent behavior, to understand the forces at work on the individual and the community, to create an environment that discourages disillusionment and alienation, that instills in young people a sense of belonging and faith in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today offers that opportunity. It is, I would suggest, the key to prevention. If we fail to prevent, the best we can do is manage consequences. Prevention is better. I urge an "aye" vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, according to the FBI testimony before our House Committee on Homeland Security: "The European and American experience shows that prisons are venues where extremists have radicalized and recruited among the inmate population."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this is not just a theoretical concern. We all remember the case of Richard Reid, apprehended while attempting to detonate a bomb on a U.S.-bound commercial flight in December 2001. Well, that same Mr. Reid is believed to have been radicalized by an imam while incarcerated in Britain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005 we learned of the California prison-based case of the "Assembly of Authentic Islam." These individuals were involved in almost a dozen armed gas station robberies in the Los Angeles area, with the goal of financing terrorist operations. They were indicted by a Federal grand jury for conspiracy to levy war against the U.S. Government through terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in April of this year, in a hearing that we held out in Torrance, California, Sergeant Larry Mead of the Gang Intelligence Unit, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, testified that "analysis shows that radicalization and recruitment in U.S. prisons is still an ongoing concern."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, in a recent report, the NYPD noted that prisons are "an excellent breeding ground for radicalization."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key to the success of stopping the spread of radicalization is identifying how radicalization begins and eliminating its breeding grounds. We know we have difficulties with this phenomenon in our prisons, but we don't know enough about it. We need to have collaboration between the Federal prison system authorities and the State prison system authorities and within the prison system authorities themselves. We need to bring together the best thinkers on this, the best people who have experience  in dealing with this already at the ground level; and, in fact, this bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Radicalization is not that well understood, and through this bill we will take an in-depth look at how it occurs. The commission provided for in <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> would give our government an in-depth, multidisciplinary look at radicalization. And why is that important? Because no one has the single answer on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we have the background of prisons as the general background to look at the radicalization in prisons, but how does it occur? Why does it occur? And why are we seeing a rise in this at this particular time when it is perhaps most dangerous to the American people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Radical Islam and its advocates around the world are a threat to America, but we have to understand we might develop a threat within the United States, as evidenced already by certain actions that have occurred. And therefore I would suggest that we vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> so we can get the facts upon which we can plan for  prevention, not just taking care of the problem after it occurs.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412234" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Thompson and certainly my good friend and colleague, Chairwoman Harman, for this legislation, and for our friends across the aisle. As a freshman, it's very instructive to watch what we can do in a bipartisan manner to protect this country. I do appreciate that. A lesson not lost on me, certainly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past May, six suspected terrorists were charged with conspiring to attack Fort Dix. Their goal was to bring about significant destruction and mass casualties to that critical military base. These six men lived less than an hour away from my home and trained right in the Pocono Mountains of northeast Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June of this year, four men were charged with plotting to attack civil aviation by blowing up jet fuel pipelines that serve JFK. In both cases the accused individuals planned, plotted, and attempted to perpetrate their crimes on American soil. More troubling is that, according to media reports, neither cell received any assistance or had any contact with al Qaeda or any other overseas terrorist group. These two recent events demonstrate the troubling presence of homegrown terrorism in the  United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of such groups are indistinguishable from traditional terrorists in that they are radicalized and sympathize with the al Qaeda cause. However, that said, they undertake their terrorist plots without training or support from a central foreign terrorist group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the civil rights and liberties protections that we enjoy as all Americans, the Federal Government must be creative in its approach to combating homegrown terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007, protects the civil rights and civil liberties of Americans and lawful permanent residents, while providing solutions for preventing future violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act creates a national commission to examine the cases of violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism. The commission will be tasked with proposing concrete recommendations and legislative strategies for mitigating these types of domestically nurtured threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act also establishes Centers for Excellence for the Prevention of Radicalization that will study the social, criminal, political, psychological, and economic roots of the problem. Additionally, it will provide Homeland Security officials across the government with suggestions for preventing future radicalization and homegrown terrorism. It requires our Homeland Security officials to thoroughly examine the experiences of other nations that have experienced homegrown terrorism so that our government  can learn from those experiences. I look forward to the passage of this vital piece of legislation and others that will make this Nation even more safe.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400648" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have to add my two cents' worth, that the same folks who were training up in the Poconos near Congressman Carney's home were training about an hour from my home as well, and we all, I think, realize the nature of this homegrown threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to rise today to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials have enjoyed a number of successes in the war against violent extremism. The plot to kill soldiers at Fort Dix, the attempt to disrupt the Kennedy Airport pipeline system, and last year's conspiracy to bring down the U.S./U.K. transatlantic flights, were all disrupted by good intelligence efforts and, as a result, lives were saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we cannot rest on our laurels. After all, it is still al Qaeda's stated goal to kill 4 million Americans, to bring the United States to its knees, and to impose a system of radical violent Islamism upon the Middle East, and in fact the rest of the world. We need to protect ourselves from this threat to do everything we can in order to make sure that there are no future terrorist attacks on the homeland, and the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act would help us certainly  in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill's effectiveness is enhanced by the fact that it was put together in a spirit of bipartisan, much to the credit of the Chair, Ms. Harman. Earlier this year, the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee's Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment Subcommittee, Congressman DAVE REICHERT, introduced legislation, <bill type="h" number="1695">H.R. 1695</bill>, that forms the basis for the current bill, <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>. Chairwoman Harman and Ranking Member Reichert  have both actively supported the current bill, which was voted out of the Homeland Security Committee without opposition in August.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, this bill was the subject of numerous hearings, excellent hearings, much to the credit of both of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill can help us to stop the spread of violent radicalization that has helped terrorist groups to grow their rank-and-file membership. It creates a 10-member national commission, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, which will study radicalization and come up with recommendations for defusing its power and preventing its spread. It establishes a university-based center of excellence that will study this phenomenon in depth, and it encourages international cooperation to stop the spread of  this violent extremism. It authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to work with nations such as the U.K. and Israel, countries that have had a lot of experience and success in dealing with violent extremism within their borders, to develop a "best practices" methodology that can be used to help prevent radicalization and to thwart ideologically based violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that Members will join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting us against violent extremism and at making us safer here in this country.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Thompson and I want to thank Ms. Harman and Mr. Reichert for conducting a number of hearings across the country to really focus our attention on what could be a very big problem if we don't get in touch with it right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the global war on terror continues, America dedicates much of its resources to tracking foreign terrorists at home and abroad. But in recent years, we have seen a rise in the number of U.S.-born criminals inspired by, but not necessarily affiliated with, groups like al Qaeda. And we have had, from Ms. Harman and Mr. Reichert and Mr. Lungren as well, a list of a number of incidents that we have seen recently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital that our Nation do what it can to understand the growing threat of homegrown terrorists and what we can do to prevent it. The Homegrown Terrorism and Violent Radicalization Act finally focuses attention on this matter. The bill establishes a national center of excellence to bring in the top minds in the world to explore the causes of radicalization. The legislation also enhances our international cooperation so we may learn from our allies who have extensive experience with homegrown  terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the centerpiece of this legislation is the establishment of a national commission to report to Congress the causes and preventive measures that we can take. The commission consists of academics, religious experts, counterintelligence officials, prison administrators, and many others with the experience provided for this input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I must make it clear this bill has strict oversight of the privacy officers within the Department of Homeland Security to ensure it respects personal and religious freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans, it is very difficult to understand why one of our citizens would want to terrorize his neighbors and countrymen. But it is a question we must face in order to protect our security. This bill tackles this head on, and I would like to thank our chairman and ranking member for bringing this bill forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007. This very important bill will play a key role in protecting our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As events abroad have taught us all too frequently, homegrown extremists and terrorists pose a serious and deadly threat to the general population. The recent attacks in Great Britain, as well as the foiled plot in Germany, prove that we must prevent the spread of violent radicalization within our own borders. They do it there; we certainly need to do more here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here at home our intelligence and law enforcement officials have done an exceptional job of keeping America safe from such threats. Over the last 1 1/2  years, we have seen plots against the Sears Tower in Chicago, Ft. Dix in New Jersey, and JFK Airport foiled by our Nation's vigilant network of law enforcement and intelligence personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us will serve to strengthen those homeland defense efforts by preventing ideologies that promote violence and terrorism from taking root in American soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that al Qaeda seeks to spread their evil philosophy everywhere, even into the minds of our own U.S. citizens. To combat radical Muslim extremists' ceaseless efforts at expansion, this bipartisan bill will create a commission to study violent radicalization and work with all levels of government both here and abroad to examine strategies to deal with this phenomena. This bill has an estimated cost of approximately $20 million. This number pales in comparison to the cost in human suffering  and economic devastation a homegrown terrorist attack might bring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans, we must never give up fighting the forces of hate and violence espoused by al Qaeda, and I believe this bill is a valuable weapon in that struggle. I commend the chairwoman and Ranking Member Reichert for their tenacity in bringing this bill to the floor, and I support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act, which I refer to as the Harman-Reichert bill. I appreciate that they have worked so well together on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I like the fact that this legislation creates a 10-member national commission, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, to study violent radicalization and ideologically based terrorism in these United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before September 11 we had the Hart-Rudman Commission, the Bremer Commission, the Gilmore Commission. They all told us the same basic point, that we have a terrorist threat and we need to recognize that threat, that we need a strategy to deal with this threat, and that we need to reorganize our government to implement the strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then came September 11, and we did wake up somewhat. We reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security. We passed the PATRIOT Act. We reorganized our intelligence agencies and created a Director of Intelligence. And we are reforming the FISA law, but this is still an issue we are working with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 9/11 Commission did something very courageous. They didn't say we are confronting terrorism; they said we are confronting Islamist terrorists who would do us harm. I think it is absolutely important we pass this legislation to begin to know the effects of radical terrorism spreading throughout the entire world and working its way into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe with all my heart and soul that we have a level of recognition of the threat that pales in comparison to what the true threat is. I think this legislation will help awaken us a bit and help awaken others within our country that this threat must be dealt with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of issues that are important for our country to deal with, but our homeland security is on the top of the list. I urge passage of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, homegrown terrorism is a very dangerous threat and must not be overlooked. The United States has an obligation and a solemn duty to guard against the violent radicalization of the American population, a radicalization that has far-reaching, devastating implications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2001, the world saw firsthand the damage that Islamic extremists can do to the American people. As we look within our own population, there are individuals who promote ideologies under the guise of religion, political, and social benefits that are diametrically opposed to the American values and liberties that we hold so dear. Ideologies of any kind, religious or otherwise, that are based on violence, intolerance, and hatred have no place in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 18 months, the United States law enforcement and intelligence agencies have stopped numerous individuals and groups that promote radical political, religious, or social beliefs from carrying out terrorist attacks on American soil. I, for one, would like to know how these individuals are operating and how they are funded. Are foreign entities providing the funding for their activities? Are these individuals who promote radical political ideologies registered as foreign agents? Perhaps  we need to reexamine the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. We need to be more proactive and strike at the roots of the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we are discussing today, <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>, is proactive instead of reactive. Britain, Spain, France, and most recently Germany and Denmark have all suffered the deadly effects of a small radicalized population that often use religion as an excuse to engage in violence and murder. The United States, thanks in large part to its alert citizenry and professional law enforcement agencies, has prevented the successful execution of several recent domestic terror threats in New York, Chicago,  Florida, and elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studying the causes of radicalization and ideologically based violence will better inform all of us how we can prevent terrorists from spreading their messages of hate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act is the work of a solid bipartisan cooperation at the subcommittee and full committee levels. Such cooperation is readily apparent as the current bill includes major aspects of <bill type="h" number="1695">H.R. 1695</bill>, Congressman Reichert's PREVENT Act, which was designed to establish a National Commission on Radicalization. The nonpartisan commission envisioned by Representatives REICHERT and HARMAN will be dedicated to comprehensively  examining the phenomenon of violent radicalization so that we might better understand its root causes within the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important timely, bipartisan piece of legislation.</paragraph>

And this committee, working with Ms. Harman has been, indeed, a pleasure, traveling across the country to various locations, holding hearings on this topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important for the American people to know and understand and realize there really is truly a threat here within the borders of the United States of America, and how important it is for all of us to work together because Americans working together keep this country safe and protect the freedoms that we have all enjoyed, for me, 57 years of enjoying the freedoms of this blessed country. And I want the same things for my children and my grandchildren. I want them to enjoy the same freedoms  that I've had the opportunities to enjoy. In order for us to do that, both sides of the aisle have to work closely together to make sure that we pass the laws, the legislation that will accomplish that great feat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In reminding the American people what has happened in the past 18 months in this country, the Sears Tower in Chicago in 2006; a New York-New Jersey PATH tunnel in July of 2006; Chicago-area shopping mall, December of 2006; passengers aboard a transatlantic flight from the U.K. to the U.S.; soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey; JFK Airport's fueling systems and others, these have been terrorist acts that have been prevented, and we need to continue that effort.

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>. This vital legislation will put our Nation on the path to addressing an emerging threat, homegrown terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is general agreement that the threat of foreign-based terrorist groups is real. We, as a Nation, have dedicated a great deal of resources to global counterterrorism. However, in some corners, there has been a kind of mindset about homeland security that believes we will be safe if we get the terrorists there before they get us here. It's the kind of mindset that ignores the fact that there are some would-be terrorists who are born here, raised and educated here, and only have lived  here in the United States. For those of us who love this Nation, it is not the kind of thing that we want to acknowledge, but we must. Enactment of <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill> will put us on a course to understanding homegrown terrorism and coming up with strategies to reduce this major threat to the homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I, also would like to pay tribute to the chairwoman of the committee for ushering this passage, as well as the ranking member of the committee. But I would also like to acknowledge that Ranking Member King, who had an unfortunate death in his family, is not here. He has been a source of support for this legislation and has helped get us to this point, and I would like to acknowledge that for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorist Prevention Act of 2007, introduced by my distinguished colleague from California, Representative HARMAN. This important legislation recognizes the threat of homegrown terrorism and seeks to address this burgeoning problem while maintaining the civil rights and liberties of American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since May of this year, two separate plots against strategic American targets have been foiled and prevented by American officials. What distinguishes them from previous terrorist plots against the United States is that the potential terrorists here have no contact with nor support from Al-Qaeda or any other overseas terrorist cells. America must be unique in its approach to homegrown terrorism, given the civil rights and civil liberties protections that are unique to America and enjoyed by all  American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a senior Member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure, I believe we can secure our homeland and remain true to our values simultaneously. The Muslim American community has grown in size and prominence, and is an integral part of the fabric of this Nation. Muslim Americans share the same values and ideals that make this Nation great. Ideals such as discipline, generosity, peace and moderation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many years of civil rights jurisprudence and law have been ignored and thrown out the window when the racial profiling, harassment, and discrimination of Muslim and Arab Americans is permitted to occur with impunity. These practices show a reckless and utter disregard for the fundamental values on which our country is founded: namely, due process, the presumption of innocence, nondiscrimination, individualized rather than group suspicion, and equitable application of the law. We cannot allow  xenophobia, prejudice, and bigotry to prevail, and eviscerate the Constitution we are bound to protect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The securing of our homeland and protection of our national security is on the forefront of my agenda. However, using 9/11 as an impetus to engage in racial profiling, harassment, and discrimination of Muslim and Arab Americans is not only deplorable, it undermines our civil liberties and impedes our success in the global war on terror. We must fight our war on terror without compromising our freedoms and liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is precisely for these reasons that I so strongly support <bill type="h" number="1955">H.R. 1955</bill>. This Act calls for the creation of the National Commission to examine the various causes of violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism in order to propose concrete and meaningful recommendations and legislative strategies in order to alleviate these threats. It also establishes a Center of Excellence for the Prevention of Radicalization and Home Grown Terrorism that will study the social, criminal, political, psychological  and economic roots of the problem as well as provide homeland security officials across the government with suggestions for preventing radicalization and homegrown terrorism. Furthermore, it requires our homeland security officials to thoroughly examine the experiences of other nations</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
