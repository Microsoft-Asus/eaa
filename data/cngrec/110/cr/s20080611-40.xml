  <narrative>
    <bill type="sc" number="89">S. Con. Res. 89</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the veterans of the First World War fought bravely and made heroic sacrifices for the Allied forces; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas past resolutions have sought authorization for American heroes to lie in honor in the rotunda of the Capitol upon an individual's passing, it is the Nation's collective desire to express its gratitude for the service of all World War I veterans by making it known to that war's last American survivor the honor it wishes to bestow on him before he passes: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. HONORING FRANK WOODRUFF BUCKLES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--In recognition of the historic contributions of United States veterans who served in the First World War, Frank Woodruff Buckles, the last surviving United States veteran of the First World War, shall be permitted to lie in honor in the rotunda of the Capitol upon his death, so that the citizens of the United States may pay their last respects to this great American.</narrative>
  <narrative> (b) Implementation.--The Architect of the Capitol, under the direction and supervision of the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, shall take the necessary steps to implement subsection (a).&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce a resolution honoring the last surviving member of a heroic group, the American World War I veterans. When the U.S. entered the First World War in 1917, 4.7 million Americans donned a military uniform and fought with the Allies struggling in an imperialistic battle of trench warfare. Now, 90 years after America's entry into the war, only one veteran remains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Frank Woodruff Buckles, born in 1901, was sent to England and France during the First World War after exaggerating his age on Army paperwork. Eager to join the action, Buckles trained in the ambulance services and acted as a driver, remaining  after the armistice to escort prisoners of war back to Germany.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Buckles now stands as the last representation of the Americans that served in the Great War. Though now distanced by the following economic depression, subsequent World War and more recent conflicts, World War I still remains a critical part of our history, symbolizing the emergence of our country as a superpower and demonstrating the willingness and selflessness of those who serve in our military. These men, 90 years later, still deserve the recognition and admiration of a grateful nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of Frank Buckles and the millions of veterans he stands for, I am introducing a resolution authorizing Mr. Buckles to lie in honor in the rotunda of the Capitol upon his passing so that citizens may pay tribute to the last member of this faithful group of Americans. After a period of repose, Mr. Buckles will receive final burial at the Arlington National Cemetery, a privilege offered earlier this year. I introduce this resolution now, so that Mr. Buckles will be aware of the respect  we wish to pay to him and his fellow veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not allow this generation to fade from our society without showing our appreciation of their service. As Ranking Member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and on behalf of Senator Byrd, I ask my colleagues to join us in extending this honor to Mr. Buckles.</paragraph>
