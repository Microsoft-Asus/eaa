  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it seems that the Democrats have a one-size-fits-all solution for all the issues facing our country: Big Government. According to the Democrats, the best thing  for the American people is to involve the government in every aspect of our lives instead of letting citizens decide for themselves what is right for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An example of this is their current proposal to let the government, quote unquote, negotiate drug prices for prescription drugs covered by Medicare. No one will argue with lower drug prices, but that is not what this bill will accomplish. What the Democrats don't tell you is that this bill will lead to fewer choices of prescription drugs for our Nation's seniors and will hurt community pharmacies, as it will increase mail order prescriptions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Madam Speaker, this bill is bad medicine, as is the notion of Big Government that the Democrats are pushing on the American people.</paragraph>
