    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is said that if a picture is worth 1,000 words, this picture tells the tale of the worst series of storms to strike southern Indiana in 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to commend and recognize the extraordinary contributions, though, of emergency management, disaster response, elected officials, community leaders and everyday Hoosiers in my district during this last week of devastating weather. I particularly want to honor EMA directors, sheriffs, mayors and county officials in Rush, Johnson and Bartholomew counties, Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They suffered greatly from tornados, heavy rains, flooding, creating a catastrophe that awaits additional presidential response, but this catastrophe did not await the response by these public servants. They went above and beyond the call of duty, showing great poise, saving lives and serving the people of their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hoosier communities and families are hurting and need to know that more help is on the way. As I rise to commend these government officials and everyday Hoosiers for their response, I urge this administration again to declare an expedited major disaster for all 44 counties of Indiana affected by these historic storms.</paragraph>
