    <paragraph>Madam President, many years ago the Congress created the party institutes to do development work across the world, building democratic institutions from Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa, to the Middle East. They have come such a long way in the time since they were created. Their workers serve in extremely tough and very dangerous situations and conditions. JOHN MCCAIN has been chairman of the International Republican Institute, and Madeleine Albright chairs the National Democratic  Institute for International Affairs. We appreciate so much the work and service both these institutes perform throughout the world in developing and creating democracies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so sad to report that yesterday in Baghdad a convoy carrying a team of NDI employees was attacked and four NDI employees were killed, including one American. This tragedy is a reminder that we have sacrifices of all kinds being made on behalf of democracy across the world. The Nation mourns the losses that occur in Iraq on  a daily basis. Yesterday, 170 Iraqis were killed that we know of, 4 Americans. I haven't received the reports this morning on  what happened last night. We also mourn for people like these gallant individuals, who were there trying to make the world a better place. Our thoughts go out to the families of these four individuals. Later today, their names will be spread across the RECORD of the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
