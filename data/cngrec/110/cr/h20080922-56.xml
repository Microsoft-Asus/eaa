    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the people in Washington State are very troubled by the fact that King George has been deposed by King Henry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We picked up Newsweek magazine today, and we have a King, King Henry. We're supposed to give him $700 billion of our money. He doesn't want any review. He wants to be able to do whatever he wants with it. He doesn't want any congressional oversight. And worst of all, our new King is like the old King: he doesn't want any sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He says, Oh, we can't threaten the salaries of these investment bankers that drove us into the ditch. We can't get anybody to pay for this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the third time we've done it with this bunch: first the war that didn't get paid for, and then the tax cuts that didn't get paid for, and now  King Henry takes over to distribute $700 billion. He's going to be there for 4 months. And in 4 months, he will make deals; and then he will go out and he will be able to catch a pass he threw to himself.</paragraph>
