  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO TOM LANTOS -- (Senate - February 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="825">S825</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on another subject, I, too, want to talk about the passing of our good friend, Tom Lantos. It would have been easy to excuse Tom Lantos for turning against the world after the sufferings he endured as a young man. But the reason we admire certain people is they do not do what we would expect them to do in the face of extraordinary trials. They transcend them. And that is why a cold wind swept through the Capitol this morning when we heard  that Tom had passed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's history is a history of unlikely success stories, but even by American standards, Tom's was stunning. When the Nazis invaded Hungary in the frenzied last months of the war, he threw on a cadet's uniform and secretly funneled food and medical supplies to those in hiding. He later said he assumed he wouldn't make it out alive, but he "wanted to be of some use."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He would add many more years to be of use--not only to his beloved wife Annette and their large extended family or to the people of California's 12th District but to suffering and oppressed people. His own bitter experiences led him to make no distinction at all among those who were denied their basic human rights. He would always be grateful for the honor of being able to help them. Well into his seventies, he said he still got goosebumps looking up at the flag on the Capitol on his morning  walk to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom and I had our differences on domestic issues, but it was a great mark of his commitment to human rights that he frequently joined Republicans when these rights were at stake. He worked with the Republicans to introduce a resolution expressing solidarity with Israel in its fight against terrorism. He worked with the Republicans to get funds to fight AIDS around the world. Every year since 2003, he and I were the House and Senate sponsors of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were also united in our strong support for Israel. We took leading roles in the House and Senate on the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act. And we were united in our concerns about Iran. Tom introduced the Iran Counterproliferation Act in the House. I cosponsored it in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Tom was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness last month, he responded again in an extraordinary way. He responded with gratitude. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground could have received an education, raised a family, and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know Tom's decision to retire was especially painful, since he had just last year been named chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, a committee he had served on for 26 years. It was a position he said he had been preparing for his whole life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With his distinctive accent, his grace, and his deep learning--he spoke five languages and devoted 6 hours a day to reading books and magazines--Tom always gave the impression of being a true gentleman of the House, and he was. But he was just as tough. Tom Lantos accomplished something few people do in life: he committed himself to an ideal and followed through on it until the end. He gave it everything he had, and America admires him for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express Elaine's and my deepest sympathies to Annette. We got to know Tom and Annette on several trips abroad, which is a way you make friendships around here, both across the aisle and in the other body. Annette and Tom lived near us here on Capitol Hill. I recall frequently seeing Annette out walking the dog. So we grieve for her and their daughters and the entire extended Lantos family on their loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments to eulogize our old friend, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Lantos. He has been one of my dear friends all these years. I have been here 31 years, and he was here 26 years. He and Annette have really been wonderful people in Elaine's and my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning began sadly, as the two leaders have said, with the news of the death of Congressman Tom Lantos, one of the giants among the Democrats in the House, and, frankly, among all Members of Congress during the last 28 years. Congressman Lantos had been diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, and had recently announced he would not run for a 14th term for the 12th District of California, which he so ably served since 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos led a remarkable life. A Hungarian Jew, he lived what he said was a happy childhood until the Hungarian fascist allies of Hitler brought the Holocaust to Hungary. Through most of the war, he was interned in various forced labor camps, some from which he escaped, and was at least once recaptured, following a beating that he later said, "I was pleasantly surprised to survive."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a final escape, he spent the remainder of the war in hiding, protected, as so many Hungarian Jews were, by Raoul Wallenberg, the man who risked his life to protect as many of Hungary's Jews as he could and who vanished into the Soviet camps at the end of the war. One of the great days of my life was to pay homage to Raoul Wallenberg at the monument in Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six hundred thousand Hungarian Jews perished in the Holocaust, including Tom Lantos's family. One of the first initiatives of Congressman Lantos upon coming to the House of Representatives in 1980 was to pass legislation granting Raoul Wallenberg U.S. citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos was, in his words, "an American by choice," and to know him was to see that every day of his life he embraced the opportunities an immigrant can find in this great country. He arrived penniless to this country, as my two colleagues have said. According to his biography, his only possession was "a precious Hungarian salami," which was confiscated upon arrival, as my colleagues mentioned. But with a scholarship and hard work, he earned a Ph.D. in economics and  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="826">S826</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos brought to the House his passionate patriotism and the drive of a survivor. When people would comment on the demands of his work, which included regular travel to his constituency 3,000 miles away, his global travels as a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which he recently chaired, and the hectic pace of his other congressional assignments, he would be quick to remind us that this was nothing in comparison to what he had faced as a young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He founded the House Human Rights Caucus, a platform which he used to highlight the human rights abuses around the world, and with which he became inextricably associated. For many of us in Congress and for many oppressed through the world, Congressman Lantos was the chairman for human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a Democrat who believed in the use of American power for good and who understood the nuances of subtle, as well as confrontational, diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, he kept trying to get a visa to visit Tehran because he believed there was always room to talk with enemies as well as friends. But when asked what he would say to the dictators in Tehran, he was less than subtle:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell the Iranians the truth--that it's a great country and they need to be reintegrated into the family of civilized nations and that they must give up their lunatic notions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than subtle, to be sure, but truthful. It is hard to disagree with this view, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos also recognized that diplomacy could fail and the use of the U.S. military could achieve noble ends. He was a strong supporter of the military during the Cold War, supported military assistance to Israel, urged President Clinton to lead NATO forces against Milosevic's genocide, and supported our interventions in Iraq, although, to be fair to him, he was critical, as many of us have been, about the implementation of our invasion of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point is, Tom Lantos represented the wing of the Democratic Party that kept central our national security concerns, that recognized our duty in the world, and accepted that the use of force is sometimes required. This is the wing of the Democratic Party that needs to survive if that party is to remain relevant to the events in the world that will continually shape us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have been a friend of Tom Lantos for decades. We loved each other. We showed that love repeatedly over the years. He was a dear friend, and I want everybody to know just how deeply I felt about him. Our staffs worked together well, and he always had my admiration and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget a tour he gave me and Senators REID and Daschle of the old Jewish ghetto in Budapest when our separate codels happened to be in that city at the same time in 1996. Later, he gave us a personal tour of the magnificent Hungarian Parliament building. One of the first post-Communist governments was in power, and they so highly regarded Tom Lantos for his heritage, as well as his anti-Communist stance throughout his life, that he was granted free access throughout  the building. He even knew where to turn the lights on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prayers and thoughts of Elaine and I go out to Annette, his beautiful wife of 58 years, whom he married in California, but who, like himself, was a survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary and was actually a childhood sweetheart. The fact that they loved each other as long as they have, that they came from similar backgrounds, and worked together daily throughout their lives only makes her loss that much sadder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our condolences go out to her and their two wonderful children. And I believe there are 18 grandchildren. But the death of Tom Lantos is a great loss, as well, to his constituents, to his colleagues in the House, to his party, and to all of us in Congress. It is a loss to our great Nation and to all those who strive in solidarity for the cause of human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos was slight of build, but he was a giant. He was a moral force who used the authority of a survivor from the Holocaust, of an American immigrant, and of a scholar and leader to show the great institution of Congress how it can lead in a dangerous and often immoral world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elaine and I loved TOM, we love Annette, and we hope we can be of some assistance to Annette and her family as we move into the future. But we will miss Tom very badly. What a great and noble man who suffered so much for freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Arizona.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, that was a very fine tribute from the Senator from Utah to a very fine man. I had the honor of serving with Tom Lantos in the House of Representatives, and I certainly join all others who mourn his death today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wonder if I might ask the Senator from California--I think she would like to make a FISA presentation. I understand the Senator would like to have about an hour. Is that how long she plans to speak?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator. I would like to say a few words about Tom Lantos, he was a friend, and also speak on two amendments on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wonder if, in the spirit the Senator and I have frequently resolved matters, I have about 10 minutes of presentation. Perhaps if we can enter into an agreement, you proceed and make your comments about Representative Lantos, I will speak for my 10 minutes or so, with the understanding that you then conclude the remainder of your remarks. We could propose that in the form of a unanimous consent agreement. Would that be acceptable?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from California is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had the great pleasure of knowing Tom Lantos as a friend and as a mentor. I have known him for many years. I last spoke with him about 3 weeks ago, maybe 4, and he said he was going to forego treatment, that he was ready for whatever would come, that he and Annette were going to remain in Washington, that he was very content with his medical treatment at Bethesda, and he did not believe he would try anything heroic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us who know, know cancer of the esophagus is devastating and unrelenting. From that point on, I began to think quite a bit about Tom Lantos. I thought back when Yahoo had the confrontation with China and did not stand up but gave in to China, and Tom stood on his feet, with amazing blue eyes and his gray hair, and said: They are moral pygmies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He called it as it was. He stood for human rights. After 30 years in the House, he became Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Regretfully, his life ended before he had much more time than a year in that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Lantos represented the district directly to the south of my city, San Francisco. He was a wonderful Representative. I watched him over the past 30 years as time went on. I watched his 18 grandchildren grow. I remember meeting them in the airport in Denver. I do not know whether Members know this; some of them were home schooled, and they went to college at the age of 14. That is pretty amazing; all high achievers, all very close, a tight family; a wife who was his childhood sweetheart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> This does not often happen. But then if you think back to Hungary in those days, and you think back to a young, blue-eyed man in the camps, escaping at night, being caught, coming back, leaving again, becoming part of Raoul Wallenberg's group, coming to this country, becoming educated and all the greatness of the country opening before him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He truly measured up to the greatness of America. I was very proud to call Tom Lantos a friend and a mentor. He will be missed. He will be missed in his district, he will be missed in California, and he will be missed in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
