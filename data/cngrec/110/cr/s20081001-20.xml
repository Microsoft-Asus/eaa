  <narrative>UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (Senate - October 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10290">S10290</bill>]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of <bill type="h" number="7081">H.R. 7081</bill>, the United States-India agreement.</chair>
  <chair>There is 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the Bingaman-Dorgan amendment No. 5683.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote threshold on the Dorgan-Bingaman amendment No. 5683 be vitiated, unless the yeas and nays are ordered.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the amendment I and Senator Bingaman have offered is to the India nuclear agreement. We both feel it is a flawed agreement that would result in the production of additional nuclear weapons on this planet, exactly the last thing we need. But I understand--and I think Senator Bingaman understands--that this Senate will likely approve this agreement by a wide margin this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment is relatively simple. It says that if India tests nuclear weapons, this agreement is nullified and we work to try to shut off supplies from the other supplier groups. The last thing we ought to allow is to have India begin testing nuclear weapons without consequence to the agreement that has been negotiated with India. Once again, let me point out that this agreement, I believe, will result in the production of additional nuclear weapons on this planet--the last thing we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment is a very important amendment dealing with the prohibition of nuclear testing, and we hope our colleagues will be supportive.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who seeks time?</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank Senator RICHARD LUGAR and Senator Joseph Biden. Joe Biden is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and he and Senator Lugar have worked on this for a long time. We have had five congressional hearings on that committee on the subject matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I greatly respect my colleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator Bingaman. However, I would point out to my colleagues that on this particular amendment they offer, the Atomic Energy Act, the Arms Support Control Act, the Hyde amendment, and this bill all have provisions in them that would allow us to respond should India decide to detonate a nuclear weapon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one anywhere wants to see a further proliferation of nuclear weapons. India and the United States are the two largest democracies in the world. India is in a very tough and fragile neighborhood. It is important we develop and improve that relationship that has been a tense one since 1974.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement began with the work of President Clinton and was concluded by President Bush. We think it is an agreement worth supporting, and we urge our colleagues to do so and respectfully reject this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on agreeing to the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment (No. 5683) was rejected.</chair>
  <chair> Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on passage of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>Who yields time? The Senator from Indiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask all Senators to participate in a historic moment. This is an opportunity for the United States and India to come together in a way that historically is important for the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>India is a very important country for us, and this relationship is sealed in a very significant way by this agreement. We have tested it in the Foreign Relations Committee for 3 years, back and forth on the nonproliferation qualities. We had great testimony from our Secretary of State, strong advocacy from our President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ask Senators to vote on this historic moment for a partnership that will be enduring, in my judgment, and will make a big difference in the history of the world.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Who yields time?</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Connecticut.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have spoken. This is a very worthwhile bill. I commend Senator Lugar and Senator Biden for the tremendous work they have done on this legislation over an extended period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for the yeas and nays and urge the adoption of the legislation.</paragraph>
