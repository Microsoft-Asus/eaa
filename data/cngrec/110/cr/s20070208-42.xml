    <paragraph>Mr. President, today with a deep sense of sadness, I wish to speak in honor of a wonderful man, Jacob N. Perkins--a former staff assistant in my office, who passed away on February 5, 2007. Although "Jake" worked for me some time ago--in 1990 and 1991--he remained a key part of what I like to call the extended Warner staff family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jake first came to my office as a summer intern from Virginia Tech University. From day one, he impressed all of us with his profound work ethic, his absolute dedication and loyalty, his keen interest in government and politics, and his generosity of spirit. In fact, Jake was such an impressive young man that, after his internship, he was hired on as a member of my permanent staff to serve as my chief mail clerk. He always carried out his responsibilities in an exemplary fashion, giving 150 percent  of effort each and every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon leaving my office, Jake returned to Virginia Tech to finish his undergraduate work. In 1994, he received his bachelor's degree in political science, compiling nearly a 4.0 average his final 2 years of school. After graduating at Virginia Tech, Jake attended law school at the University of Maryland in Baltimore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through all the time that has passed, Jake has remained a steadfast friend of my office, supporting my campaigns and projects whenever possible and maintaining warm and important friendships with current and former staff members. Indeed, only this past Christmas, he was the principal organizer of our annual staff alumni luncheon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, Jake began to have significant health problems. His passing away this past Monday at the early age of 37, reportedly due to kidney transplant complications, is a tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jake was a remarkable man in so many ways. For one, you would never have known he was ill, not even for a day. He was the type of man who never  complained, who was always upbeat, and who continuously looked out for his friends and family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was an avid Virginia Tech sports fan, an unfailing fan of the New York Yankees, and always eager to enjoy a game of golf with his friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jake had a tremendous community presence in his home of Poolesville, MD. From his leadership role in the local Chamber of Commerce, to organizing and serving as chair of "Poolesville Day" in honor of his beloved community, to helping coach youth basketball teams, to serving as an announcer at local school sporting events, Jake's dedication to community service exemplified the motto of his alma-mater, Virginia Tech: Ut Prosim--that I may serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jake Perkins was a big man with a big presence. The biggest thing about him, however, was his heart. He will be greatly missed by this Senator and many Warner staff members past and present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My sincere condolences go out to his dear mother, Mrs. Ellen Perkins of Poolesville, MD, and his brother and sister-in-law, Michael and Shoshana Perkins. We thank you for the gift of Jake's friendship in our lives. We will miss him, but we are forever grateful for the time we had with him. Jake Perkins will always be remembered.</paragraph>
