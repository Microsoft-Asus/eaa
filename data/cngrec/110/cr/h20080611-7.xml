  <narrative>SOARING GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5217]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this quote from Daniel Webster appears above the Speaker's rostrum right up at the top of the Chamber. And it says this: "Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As families struggle with soaring gas prices, our Nation's energy solutions, I think, lie on Webster's words. House Republicans have offered a plan to  lower gas prices by developing the resources of our land in an environmentally safe way. This is an approach that is supported by some 60 percent of the American people in a recent Gallup poll. But the majority won't listen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, they let gas prices surge even higher by refusing to schedule a plan to break America's dependence on foreign sources of energy. Mr. Speaker, I think American consumers deserve better. It is time to develop the resources of our land and bring down gas prices on behalf of American families and small businesses. And that, as Webster said, would be "worthy to be remembered."</paragraph>
