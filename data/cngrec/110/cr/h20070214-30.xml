  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution (<bill type="hr" number="159">H. Res. 159</bill>) and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Deal) is recognized for 1 hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes of time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and thank him for arranging for this resolution to be heard at this time today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we all know, we lost a true champion in the House of Representatives on yesterday: Charles Norwood from Georgia. Charlie, as he was known by most of us here, was truly a friend across party lines and across State lines. He was a true patriot. He served in the dental services in the U.S. Army in the combat zone of Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He returned to a private dental practice in Georgia, and then in the election cycle of 1994 was elected to this House of Representatives. He came with a passion for many things. Health care was at the very top of his list. Education was very shortly thereafter. And he worked on both of those issues with all of his heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He inspired many people in this House because he was indeed passionate about everything that he did. If he was your friend, you knew he was your friend. If you were on the opposite side of an issue from him, he let you know that as well, but he was still your friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us watched as we observed what had been diagnosed in 1998 as an incurable disease. And following that diagnosis, he underwent lung transplant surgery. That was a process that most of us probably would have had great difficulty undergoing. But Charlie did it with courage. He rebounded with the same kind of determination  and willingness to go forward in spite of the inconveniences that that brought to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw him with his oxygen tank, and we saw him on his little scooter as he rode around the Capitol on his way over here and back and forth to votes. Throughout it all, he maintained his good humor, he maintained his zest for life. Charlie Norwood is someone who will truly be missed.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Deal and members of the delegation for bringing this resolution before us as a tribute to our fallen colleague, Mr. Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than anything else, Congressman Norwood was a warrior. He fought for his beliefs with passion and conviction, and he fought for the people of his district and for the people of Georgia who loved him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was awarded two Bronze Stars for his bravery on behalf of our Nation during the Vietnam war, and he fought courageously for patient rights right here on the floor of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, his last official act was to reintroduce the Patients' Bill of Rights on Monday, a bill he coauthored with John Dingell. Charlie Norwood, this good man, this son of Georgia, fought a good fight. He was a warrior to the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thoughts and prayers of all of the Members of Congress, and especially the members of the Georgia delegation, are with his wife Gloria and his two sons, Charles and Carlton, their family and his many grandchildren. I hope they will find comfort in knowing that Congressman Charlie Norwood made a lasting contribution not just to the State of Georgia, but to the Nation and to all of us as Members of this body. We are more than lucky, we are very blessed to have known him as a friend  and as a colleague. He will be deeply missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would yield 3 minutes to our Georgia colleague (Mr. Gingrey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Charlie Norwood was a very successful dentist in my hometown of Augusta, Georgia. I didn't know Charlie at that time because I had long since moved away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as a practicing physician in Marietta, Georgia, as an OB/GYN, several years ago I went to the annual meeting of the Georgia OB/GYN Society to hear Dr. Charlie Norwood talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights. Physicians across Georgia and across this country were concerned with managed care and HMOs and liability and that sort of thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, when I heard Dr. Norwood speak to my colleagues, physicians about this issue, and them, in turn, including myself, give him a standing ovation, I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, and I never did tell Charlie this, but that was an inspiration to me to want to some day have the opportunity, and thank God that I did, to follow in that walk that he walked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a great Member of this body and what a fierce competitor and a fair competitor, Mr. Speaker. As my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the distinguished John Lewis, knows well, Charlie would fight for something he believed in but in a very respectful way. And he thought about others before himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An example, Mr. Speaker, is that just in this last election cycle, when Charlie was suffering so much, as Representative Deal has just mentioned, he didn't think about himself. He won his reelection with 67 percent of the vote. And it wasn't that he couldn't campaign because of his illness. He was working all that time for another colleague in a very competitive district. He was essentially running that other campaign. That is the kind of guy Charlie Norwood was, and  the kind of fellow that we will all remember here on both sides of the aisle in this great House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a friend, he was a colleague. He was a fighter. He was a fighter for patients' rights. He was a fighter for students, as his work on the Education and Workforce Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, he is somebody that we can all emulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I just want to say to his wife Gloria, to his two sons, Carlton and Charles, Jr., and to the four grandchildren and to the Norwood family, we are praying for you. We want to uplift you. We will be with you tomorrow, but we know, as you do, that Charlie is in heaven right now, and God has accepted him in open arms and saying, well done, my good and faithful servant.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to my distinguished colleagues from Georgia and other Members of Congress who are here, this is indeed a sad occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie Norwood led an extraordinary life. He was a combat veteran. He was a dentist. He pulled himself up by his own bootstraps, truly a son of the South, a son of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a person that cared about all of the people of Georgia. Let me give you an example, if I may. I remember when I was serving in the Georgia legislature as a State senator, and we needed some help for the Morehouse School of Medicine's National Primary Care Center. The person that led the fight up here to secure the Federal dollars for the Morehouse School of Medicine's Primary National Care Center was Charlie Norwood. And we thank him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I think of Charlie Norwood, and I think of so many of the great debates and the battles that we have had up here that we have shared, I am reminded of a great conversation that took place between two great men, Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee. It was at a time when this Nation was going through its great Civil War and how to fix that. That conversation went like this. Robert E. Lee said, it is not incumbent upon us to complete the task. And Abraham Lincoln said, nor  are we free to desist from doing all we possibly can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the essence of Charlie Norwood. We might not have to complete this task, to make America a better place, but neither are we free to desist from doing all we possibly can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie, we appreciate you. You fought the good fight. You stayed the course. And for you, God has put up an extraordinary crown of righteousness. We thank you, and we thank God for passing our way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Price).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America, the State of Georgia and this House of Representatives have lost a great public servant, an uncommon leader, and a proud patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am profoundly saddened by the passing of Congressman Charlie Norwood, a gentleman who selflessly served the people of Georgia and this House for more than 12 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie spent his entire life helping others as a soldier, as a dentist, as a legislator. He served valiantly in the defense of our Nation in the Medical Battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam. He returned home to serve his community in Augusta as a dentist. And for 12 years, he was a faithful servant to the people of Georgia in his district as a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Congress he was a passionate supporter of our military and of our veterans. He was a tireless advocate for patients and patient centered health reform. And he never forgot for whom he was to work in Washington, his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Norwood was a dear friend to me. His friendship and his perspective and his guidance in this House are things that I will always cherish. Anyone who knew Charlie knew that he was as tough as they come and he always stood up for what he believed in. Rarely, rarely in any walk of life are we privileged to come to know someone who stood for his principles as strongly as Charlie Norwood. His legacy in the House of Representatives will be one of integrity, one  of vigor, and one of loyalty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Norwood's devotion to this body and to our country will be sorely missed, but his legacy will never be forgotten. And I shall never forget that wry smile and that twinkle in his eye. What a hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in expressing our deepest sympathies to Charlie's wife Gloria, his family and his friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And while we mourn the loss of this great patriot, we celebrate his lifetime  of noble and heroic service and we thank God for giving us the gift of the life of Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the fine colleagues that we have who are from Georgia for giving each and every one of us a chance to speak. I am not from Georgia, and I know he was your favorite son, but I do want to give this as my chance to honor this very distinguished Member of Congress, Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise, Mr. Speaker, today with a heavy heart but also real admiration for the life of this dear colleague of ours, Charlie Norwood. And my heart as well as all of our hearts go out to his family members, to his community, and to all of the people whose life he has touched.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege of serving on the Energy and Commerce Committee with Charlie for several years and had the opportunity to work with him on initiatives in the Health Subcommittee. And though he and I come from vastly different places on the ideological spectrum, we were often able to see eye to eye on health policy as two health professionals serving in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to work with him in co-chairing the School Health and Safety Caucus, where we used the opportunity to spotlight ways in which we could improve the health of children through school-based initiatives. I was also honored to work with him on legislation to promote children's dental health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we can all agree that Charlie will be remembered as reliably conservative, but also as an independent thinker. His leadership on establishing a Patients' Bill of Rights was exemplary of his willingness to go out on a limb for something in which he truly believed. He introduced that bill shortly before I came to Congress, and the momentum for passage of the Patients' Bill of Rights was one of the main reasons that I was eager to serve on this Health Subcommittee, which he belonged  to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admired his characteristic patient-centered approach to health care policy. It wasn't popular with some of our colleagues, and the President flat-out warned that his bill would be vetoed. But Charlie continued forward and was looking forward to an opportunity to finally pass the Patients' Bill of Rights in its original form in this, the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to take this opportunity to express again my condolences to the Norwood family and to thank them all for the tremendous years, 12 years, of service that they allowed their Charlie to serve with us all in Congress. And I thank my colleagues again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to another Georgia colleague (Mr. Linder).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding his time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met Charlie Norwood over 30 years ago. We were both young dentists in Georgia. He was the president of the Georgia Dental Association, and I was a young, newly elected dentist in the Georgia legislature. And his enthusiasm blew me away. Irrespective of what he was talking about, he only had two gears: neutral and full speed ahead. And his enthusiasm would capture you. And the bulldoggedness, the way he would put his teeth on an issue and fight for it without ever backing up was astonishing  to me. Charlie did not have a coy bone in his body. From the day you met Charlie, you knew what he stood for on whatever the issue was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Respectfully, he and I differed on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We spent many hours talking about it. He was adamant that I was wrong and he was right. But at no point did he ever raise his voice or show any disrespect for a position that I had taken that was different from his.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie loved this institution. He loved the give-and-take of it. He loved the formality of it. We talked one day if he ever had any notion of running for the Senate, and he said he would never survive there. He would never survive not getting something done every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He treated this institution that he loved with great dignity. When he fought his fights, you knew he was going to fight fair. And for 30-plus years when I have been able to visit with him or know him on this issue or that, I always walked away from each encounter saying what a nice man, what a nice man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Gloria and the family, you are in our prayers. A psalmist has written that the Lord is close to the broken-hearted, and those who are crushed in spirit He saves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God give you peace.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400628" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise this afternoon to remember one of our fellow delegation members, the Honorable Charlie Norwood. I know that many Members of this body served with Charlie much longer than I did, but unlike them, I think I may be the only Member here with the distinction of once actually having been represented by Charlie as one of his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie Norwood was an accomplished and a tireless legislator who had stands on issues that ran the political spectrum. And while I may not have agreed with him on every issue, I always admired his spirit, and I say that as a former constituent and as a colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As anyone who knew him will tell you, Charlie cared deeply for the State of Georgia and for the people he represented in Congress for over 12 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this Chamber and among this delegation, there is no question that Charlie Norwood will be missed and his absence will be long felt here in Washington and back home in Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My prayers remain with Congressman Norwood's wife, Gloria, and with their entire family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the minority leader (Mr. Boehner).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I come to remember my good friend and our good friend, CHARLIE NORWOOD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met CHARLIE in October of 1994 when he was a candidate for Congress for the first time and had dinner with him one night before we went off on a 16-city tour. I didn't think it would ever end. But at dinner that night, I looked at CHARLIE and I asked, Why are you running for Congress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he said, That OSHA, that OSHA, they did this to me and did this to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for every day that CHARLIE NORWOOD served in this Congress, he was all over OSHA, to have rules and regulations that met the straight-face test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was the chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and CHARLIE was one of my subcommittee Chairs for the 5 years that I was the chairman. Clearly the most difficult member I have ever had to try to manage. And whether it was the Patients' Bill of Rights, whether it was OSHA, or a host of other issues, when CHARLIE got that bone in his mouth, you could not get it out of his mouth. He was the most dogged, persistent Member I have ever worked with. As a matter of fact,  I might even say he might be the most dogged persistent person that I have ever met with because when CHARLIE picked up a cause, he was never going to leave it alone until he accomplished his goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am sure that CHARLIE is watching over us today, wondering why the Patients' Bill of Rights isn't law. Mr. Linder just talked about it. CHARLIE fought about this on more occasions than you can ever imagine, as did JOHN and a lot of other Members. But CHARLIE truly believed in that piece of legislation. He put his heart and soul into it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to miss CHARLIE around here. We are going to miss that dogged persistence that he brought to this floor every day and in the committee rooms every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to Gloria and his family, our prayers are with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, CHARLIE, may your soul rest in peace.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor CHARLIE NORWOOD, a great servant of the people of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By now you have all heard about his life, so I won't spend much time on his extensive biography. But I do want to bring attention to what he would have  wanted us to focus on above and beyond his legislative accomplishments, and that is his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I did not get an opportunity to get to know CHARLIE, but I do know enough about him to understand what was most important to him. He was a man of high character and values, and so his family was very important. So I would like to mention and send my deepest condolences to CHARLIE's beautiful wife, Gloria, and his two sons, Charles and Carlton, who enabled him and made it possible for him to serve so honorably, particularly at times when clearly he must have not been feeling well.  But he still persisted with his duties and responsibilities as a Congressman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It takes a lot to just walk these Halls from the office to the Capitol and back again, and he walked as long as he could, and then he started taking his wheelchair. So the man had a spirit to prevail over whatever obstacles might have befallen him. That is a spirit that each one of us can learn from and live by and do the best that we can, like he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in addition to just being a great human being, there were a number of legislative accomplishments. I will not go over those either, but I will say as a member of the Armed Services Committee, that I want to bring attention to his military service. He was awarded the Combat Military Badge and two Bronze Stars for his service in Vietnam. While I did not always or often agree with him on the issues, by all accounts he served his State and his district well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Georgia and this Nation have lost a great man, and I am honored to have this opportunity to recognize his contributions today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to yield 3 minutes to our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, CHARLIE NORWOOD was a friend of mine, he was a friend of all Georgians, and he was a friend of every freedom loving person in this world, because he fought hard for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was one of the original Republican revolutionaries that was elected in 1994, and he never really lost that spirit, that conservative fever. He agreed with Jefferson that the government that governs least, governs best, and he fought for 12 years in this House to make sure that regulations on business and individuals' lives were at a minimum. In fact, sometimes he called the government's reach into our lives oppressive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once CHARLIE was quoted in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, as saying, "If I want to put bad wiring in my house and burn my family down, that is my problem, not the government's."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was typical of CHARLIE. He was a witty warrior. When he joined me in the Voting Rights Act, trying to modernize section 5, the renewal of the Voting Rights Act, I had come up with two amendments. One of them had to do with putting the whole country under it, going through the same scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met with CHARLIE and CHARLIE said, "Lynn, I want the modernization amendment to be the Norwood amendment." I said, "That's fine, Charlie, but why?" He said, "Because I can do a better job than you can." That is the way he felt, and that is exactly the way he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is just one example of why I called CHARLIE my "foxhole buddy." When CHARLIE NORWOOD said he was with you, he was with you until the bitter end. You had his word that he would have your back, and his word was his bond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His loyalty and love of country defined him throughout his life. The Valdosta High School football star went on to become a dentist who took his skills to the front lines of Vietnam, where he served his fellow soldiers and his Nation with valor. He served in Vietnam for a year and obtained the rank of captain and won two Bronze Stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the next four decades, CHARLIE and his loving wife Gloria made their home Augusta, where they raised two children, Carlton and Charles, and he served his community with a smile on his face when he talked about his grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the thoughts and prayers of all Georgians go out to the Norwood family tonight, to let that family know that we are appreciative of the time that they allowed CHARLIE to come up here and to serve with us, to bring joy to our hearts and thoughts to our minds of what we could do to make this country a better place to live in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one thing that I want to close with is this, Mr. Speaker: In all of the discussions that I got into with CHARLIE NORWOOD about legislation he constantly said, "Lynn, we have got to do what's right." That was his motto, to do what was right, and he did. It was an honor to call him friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to stand this afternoon to give some remarks about our colleague and dear friend, CHARLIE NORWOOD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shakespeare wrote that all the world is a stage and all the men and women merely players. Each has his entrance and his exit. One man in his time may play many parts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it was with CHARLIE. CHARLIE was a son, a son to Charlie Norwood, Sr., and Lola. He was a husband to Gloria. He was a father to Charlie and Carlton and a grandfather. And he was a cousin to two very, very wonderful ladies down in Valdosta who said that they often prayed for Cousin Charlie, because they just couldn't understand how he became a Republican.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE was a student. CHARLIE got his bachelor's. He studied dentistry. He was a soldier. He served his country. He was in Vietnam. But CHARLIE was a public servant. CHARLIE believed in serving leadership, and he lived it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE really was great, because measured by the standards of Jesus, that he who is great among you shall be your servant, and he who is greatest shall be servant unto all, CHARLIE measured up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE was a fighter. CHARLIE fought hard for any principle in which he believed. He didn't give up, as you heard, on the Patients' Bill of Rights. He was a fierce competitor. I often didn't agree with him, but I had to admire his tenacity, because he was a fighter. And all the way to the end, CHARLIE fought. He fought for life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all blessed, really blessed, to have known CHARLIE. And Gloria was devoted to CHARLIE. She took leave from her duties as a member of the Congressional Club to attend to CHARLIE, to give CHARLIE her best efforts in his last days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But CHARLIE served well. He really embodied God's minute. I have only just a minute, only 60 seconds in it; forced upon me, can't refuse it; didn't seek it, didn't choose, did it; I must suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it; just a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, CHARLIE. You used your minute well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Congressman Deal, for coordinating this tribute to a patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute and remembrance of my dear friend and our colleague CHARLIE NORWOOD. Upon my election 5 years ago, two of the first people to offer guidance to me were CHARLIE and Gloria Norwood. As a Member of Congress from an adjoining district, I learned firsthand of CHARLIE's dedication to the public and his love of America. Gloria has been a model First Lady for the district, enthusiastically assisting CHARLIE in his life of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE was a committed health care practitioner, a loving family man and a passionate public servant. He spent his entire life fighting for the people of his beloved Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>True to his character, CHARLIE fought to the end, despite debilitating health conditions. He was always in good spirits, even though we knew he was exerting extraordinary efforts to fully represent his constituents. He reminded me so much of my predecessor, the late Congressman Floyd Spence, a fellow courageous lung transplant recipient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of serving with CHARLIE on the Education and Workforce Committee. I am honored to, this  year, be the Republican ranking member on the Workforce Protection Subcommittee, which CHARLIE ably chaired for three terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Congress, CHARLIE was an ardent advocate for health care reform and patients' rights. He was a good friend and strong supporter of the employees of the Savannah River Nuclear Laboratory. I was proud to work closely with him in our efforts to create a MOX facility for the transformation of plutonium waste at the Savannah River site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE is survived by his wife Gloria; his two sons, Charles and Carlton; and four grandchildren. Roxanne and I join with his colleagues in mourning his passing and send our prayers to his family, staff and constituents. May God bless the Norwood family at this time, and may they know that he made a significant and positive difference for America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and having this Special Order to honor the life and service of our colleague Congressman Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great sadness that we received the news first of his illness and then of his passing. We had hoped to have an occasion such as this before he died so he could hear the praise of his colleagues on the floor. I know that many conveyed their good wishes to him personally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He left us in a very dignified way. He decided that he would be, as he lived, surrounded by his family at home so that he could die in peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Norwood, as we all know, as our minority leader mentioned, he had his own particular style, plain spoken, very eloquent, and he was a passionate public servant. He served our country and his own community in Vietnam in service to our country and in the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, in this Congress he did his best to serve his constituents, his conscience, and his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, he faced the end of his life and his sickness with great bravery and dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers, I have conveyed to his wife Gloria, but I say again on this floor that our thoughts and prayers are with Gloria and his two sons, Charles and Carlton, and his four grandchildren. I know that I can speak for all Members of Congress when we convey our sympathy to them. I hope that it is a comfort to them that so many people mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to read a part of a letter. It is dated February 8, 2007. It is to myself. It is from Congressman Norwood. It is the last official correspondence that I received from him. It says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Dear Joe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"When you receive this letter, you will know of my return to Georgia after my decision to forego further medical treatment in the Washington, D.C., area for my ongoing battle with non-small-cell cancer. Needless to say, I hope things turn out for the best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I expect to be unavailable for my duties for the foreseeable future. I do, however, expect my staff to continue working on several issues, even if I can't be there in person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I will have my staff working on the Living Organ Kidney Donation Clarification Act (<bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill>). This bipartisan, bicameral bill addresses the issue of paired transplantation, which is a way to solve the dilemma faced by people who want to become living organ donors for a family member or friend, but are unable to do so because they are biologically incompatible. In the process of kidney-paired donor transplants, a pair consisting of a kidney transplant candidate and an incompatible living donor  is matched with another such incompatible pair to enable two transplants that otherwise would not occur. This bill is widely supported, has no known opposition, doesn't cost a dime, will save Medicare money, and will save thousands of lives. I urge you to work with Mr. Inslee, Chairman Dingell, and my staff to move this important bill forward."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have checked with Chairman Dingell. He has assured me that he is prepared to move the bill if it is as he says it is. Knowing CHARLIE, always telling the truth, it is. So hopefully, very soon on the floor of this body, we will have the Charlie Norwood Living Organ Kidney Donation Clarification Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are so many stories, but I want to tell one Norwood story. CHARLIE asked me and now my wife, then my girlfriend, Terri, to go down to the Masters Golf Tournament. I am not golfer and so I discouraged him from asking me. He said you may not like it but Terri will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we got to go down to the tournament, and on the first day we went to the tournament, CHARLIE was telling me how plugged in he was with all the folks at the Masters and how many people he knew and really he was really a major figure out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we pulled up to the driveway to go up to the main clubhouse that you have seen on TV, and the guard at the gate said, May I help you? He said, I am Congressman Norwood, and I have got Congressman Barton of Texas, and we want to go up to the clubhouse. The guard said, Well, Congressman, you are not on the list. He said, I am not on the list? And the guard said, No, Congressman, you are not. So I started giving CHARLIE a hard time from the backseat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, CHARLIE, I thought you were a big player around here; you cannot even get up to the clubhouse. So Norwood started giving me a hard time, and I started hoorahing the guard, and he said, Wait a minute; he said you are a Congressman from Texas? And I said, Yes, sir. He said, Congressman Norwood, you park right up there by the clubhouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, for that one day, CHARLIE NORWOOD had a better parking spot than Tiger Woods or Arnold Palmer or any of the members of the Masters golf course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is in heaven now and my guess is he has got the best parking spot in heaven, too. God bless you, CHARLIE NORWOOD, and God bless you, Gloria, and God bless all your family members. You will dearly, dearly be missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the resolution and to pay tribute to my friend and fellow member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Dr. Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie came to Congress after my first term as part of the class of 1994, and it seems a year did not go by that we did not serve on a committee together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I honorably served with him at first on the Education and Workforce Committee and then later on the Energy and Commerce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie and I shared a passion for health care issues, and I particularly enjoyed our work together on the Health Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A dentist by training, Charlie was devoted to improving the health care system, not only for providers like himself but also for the patients that rely on our health care system to keep them well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The phrase Patients' Bill of Rights would not have been coined if Charlie and our chairman, JOHN DINGELL, had not teamed up to give patients an ability to fight back against the HMOs that too often make health care decisions based on the bottom line, rather than a physician's recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note Charlie's last legislative act before leaving Washington and returning to Georgia was to reintroduce the Patients' Bill of Rights in this Congress as <bill type="h" number="979">H.R. 979</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt in my mind that this legislation will be Charlie's legacy and will honor him and his work in this esteemed Chamber by finally making his vision of patients' rights a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last July 4 recess, Charlie and I joined two other members of the Health Subcommittee as we visited the impressive trauma facilities utilized by our brave military doctors to treat our wounded service personnel in Balad and Baghdad, Iraq and Kabul, Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew there was a good reason Charlie and I got along, despite being different parties, but I also realized that  trip that Charlie and I shared a lot of interests, and one of them in firearms. I met few people with more enthusiasm for firearms than Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I will mention that how he cared about people, and Chairman DEAL understands that, he presented a book to those of us who went. It has a picture of Charlie Norwood with a .50-caliber machine gun in a helicopter we were flying in, but Charlie was not really happy because he was not sitting behind that .50-caliber machine gun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie was a good doctor and honorable Member of Congress and a great friend. He always thought of others, and I will always remember him for his friendship for these years. Our thoughts are with his family, and his wife Gloria has become a good friend of my wife Helen through the Congressional Spouses, and I will miss Charlie, and we all will. We honor his memory and his contributions to our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Barrett).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too stand in favor of the resolution for my friend Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first started running in 2002, Charlie was one of the first guys to grab me by the hand, introduce me to people, and be my friend. I remember my first day in Congress Charlie coming up to me and said, "Boy, you just hang with me, I will take good care of you." And he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He always told me that the Augusta side of Georgia was mine and the North Augusta side of South Carolina was his; that no river or border could keep us apart. And it was true. And the things he did for me, the things he did for South Carolina, for Georgia, for this Nation will always be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie Norwood was a good friend of mine, and we will be sad and we will cry, but in heaven they are screaming, "We love you, Charlie." God bless you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400254" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I didn't know Charlie well; I only met Charlie once before I came to Congress and then had a few occasions to work with him in Congress. I certainly knew his reputation. He was a great advocate for veterans and a great advocate for patients' rights and, on some subjects, willing to buck his leadership in order to advance the cause of patients' rights, and it was something I appreciated a great deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Charlie grew sicker, from time to time I would seek him out on the floor and ask him how he was doing. He was always upbeat about it, he was always positive about it. He was never down and sad. He would be very frank about what he was able to do and where he was and what his challenges were, but he was always positive about his circumstances. His circumstance was awful, as everybody knows. He fought this disease for years and gradually grew worse, and we were all worried about him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So one of the things I did just trying to get to know Charlie a little better is I went to his Web site and looked up a little bit about him, and was struck by the description that I found of his military service in Vietnam. And I thought I would like to just read that; and many people who are watching this won't have an opportunity to hear this about Charlie, though everybody knows, I think, that he served in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But specifically during his tour in Vietnam, Charlie Norwood participated in experimental military dental practices that became standard procedure for the Armed Forces after the war. He was one of the first participants in the Army outreach program to deliver dentists to forward fire bases in lieu of transferring patients to rear treatment areas. I am not sure if the rest of the dentists and the doctors appreciated that very much; it meant that you were going into harm's way a little  bit more than they otherwise would.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Norwood also provided some of the first field-based dental treatment of military guard dogs, and assisted in nondental trauma care in Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals, MASH, units. In recognition of his service under combat conditions, he was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. After Vietnam, he was assigned to the Dental Corps at Fort Gordon, Georgia, where he served until his discharge in 1969. Norwood was awarded the Association of the Army's Cocklin Award  in 1998, and was inducted into the Association's Audie Murphy Society in 1999. He remained a lifelong member of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Military Order of the World Wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie's family should be very proud of Charlie Norwood. As Charlie Norwood was slowly struggling with the disease that took his life, he had to look back on his life and realize that he helped an awful lot of people in a very positive way. We will miss him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I mourningly lost not only a colleague but a very close friend. We all know that CHARLIE's unwavering dedication to his constituents and to our Nation inspired us who had the privilege of serving with him. He was known and was well-documented as a principled lawmaker who was absolutely committed to his values and to his work in this people's House. He was never afraid to stand up for his convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak on a personal note, because CHARLIE and I were elected in 1994, and I see several of my colleagues here that are going to speak after me. My wife Claire and his wife Gloria became friends during the orientation. And while my wife doesn't come back here as often as Gloria was here with CHARLIE, whenever she came back we always made it a point as often as we could to get together with the Norwoods and have dinner. CHARLIE loved to try  a lot of different venues: He was a steak man, and we ate steak. He liked Italian food, and we found several Italian places that we ate. He took me to a Korean restaurant. He liked Korean food after being in Asia. And we had great conversations. We talked about the patients' bill of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is one legacy I think that CHARLIE will leave with all of us, it is the bulldoggedness and the determination with which he pursued legislation. But if there is one other legacy that will be left, it is the way he displayed the courage to fight this disease that he had. And I truly think, Mr. Speaker, that any lesser man would not have lasted as long as he did with the disease that he had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE will be very, very much missed, and our prayers go out to Gloria and the family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank all of my colleagues for the comments they have made today. The job of the whip in the House is supposed to be the job of organizing the Members, and many people think it is the job of convincing Members they should do something they don't really want to do. I will tell you that the Member that it would have been the most impossible to convince to do anything he didn't want to do was CHARLIE NORWOOD. He was here to do what he thought was the right thing to do. It wasn't  always what I thought was the right thing, but it was what he thought was the right thing and he was  going to do it. The toughness, the courage, the determination of CHARLIE NORWOOD was extraordinary among an extraordinary group of people. Just this struggle</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people that sent him here should be proud, the people who worked with him should be proud. The people of the United States would be proud if they knew the great and tireless job that CHARLIE NORWOOD did for them every day. And I am honored to have had a chance to serve with him and call him my friend.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thank you, sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent Pinehurst, North Carolina, the golf capital of America. And when I would say that, CHARLIE took great umbrage, he being from Augusta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On one occasion, CHARLIE overheard someone ask me to describe my district. I replied, "I represent High Point, the furniture capital of the world; I represent one of the finest zoos in the country near Asheboro." And knowing that CHARLIE was listening, I said very condescendingly, "And, of course, the golf capital of America in Pinehurst."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE jumped up from his chair, this is the sanitized version. He said, "Now, you son of a gun," he said, "I will let you have the furniture and zoo, but you ain't taking golf."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told that story, Mr. Speaker, to the Southern Pines North Carolina Rotary Club, and within one week that story was personally delivered to Doc Norwood. And CHARLIE said to me, "Howard, don't ever talk about anybody. It will come back to bite you."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE NORWOOD, as has been said many times on this floor today, one great guy, one great Congressman who will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE, I won't even say Pinehurst is the greatest golf capital of the world at least for a day or two in remembrance of you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And condolences to Gloria and the entire Norwood family.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was truly an honor to know CHARLIE NORWOOD; I admired and respected him. And shortly after I got here to this body I was told by another Member from Georgia, he was sitting by CHARLIE when I was up speaking and he said, Who is that guy? I like him. Well, the feeling was more than mutual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE NORWOOD, what was not to like? His dogged determination, some would say he was stubborn as a mule. But I think Charlie might more elegantly say he was persistent until it almost ceased to be a virtue. But with CHARLIE, it was a virtue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some gave him bad press, along with some others of us that worked together on the Voting Rights Act. Some falsely claimed that CHARLIE and others of us were trying to restrict the usage of the Voting Rights Act when a clear indication, everything CHARLIE did, everything we worked on, everything we talked about behind the scenes was, by golly, the Voting Rights Act has done good for the places it has been applied. It needs to be applied in every district in America until racial  disparity has disappeared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And although we lost on the floor temporarily, I do believe there is Scripture to support people in heaven to know what is going on here on Earth. They rejoice over one soul's salvation, they know that it isn't over yet. As a matter of equal protection, I think we eventually will get it extended to every district where there is racial disparity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Gloria, to the Norwood family, all we can say through the Speaker is, thank you for sharing this wonderful gift with us. And to God on high, thank you for sharing this gift with this House of Representatives.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400288" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as you have heard some of my other colleagues say, there were a group of us who came in in 1995 together with CHARLIE and got to know him very well and consider him a dear friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have heard all the words, "perseverance" and "doggedness" and "determination" and "stubborn" and all those other things that describe CHARLIE, but there are also some other words that describe CHARLIE, and that was "loyal" and "friend," because he was a friend to all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gloria and CHARLIE and I became very good friends early on. You could always count on him. There was never any question, if you needed CHARLIE, he was there if he believed in what you were doing; if he didn't, he would always forthrightly tell you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also displayed that big word "courage," because we saw what he went through as he spent his last 3 years here, and he was always doing his job for his people. The other thing about CHARLIE was integrity. I think you have to look long and far to find someone who had more integrity than CHARLIE NORWOOD; if he gave you his word, he gave you his word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of our blessings go to Gloria and his family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn the loss of my friend, CHARLIE NORWOOD, and to pay tribute to him and his record, and to extend my sympathies to his wife and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE NORWOOD was an extraordinary human, an extraordinary soldier and an extraordinary United States Congressman, and the Nation is better for his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have heard it said here, over and over and over again, that he was passionate, that he was a fighter for the cause, whether that was in Vietnam, whether that was in his chosen field, dentistry, or whether that was here in the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I worked closely with CHARLIE on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I believed deeply, as CHARLIE did, that individual human beings, patients, were being injured by the practices of managed care companies around the country, and that we needed to do something about that. CHARLIE injected himself in that fight with the kind of passion that CHARLIE brought to every fight. And I worked shoulder to shoulder with Charlie in that fight, and Dr. TOM COBURN, and  learned what a great individual and what an inspiring principled human being he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the best thing about CHARLIE was the twinkle in his eye. When CHARLIE got into a fight, he would literally light up, and light the room with a twinkle of being able to press forward with his fight and his belief and his passion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will all miss him. I consider it a privilege to have known him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Charlie Norwood and I were elected together in 1994, as were the two previous speakers. And we were part of that history-making, majority-making 73-Member class who came to office in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It didn't take us long to realize that Charlie Norwood was one of the wisest and steadiest and most dependable Members of that class. He was a conservative, and never wavered from that philosophy. He was trustworthy, as Mrs. Myrick said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a competitor. When Charlie Norwood waged battle on this floor on your side, you knew you had a capable comrade at arms. And if he was on the other side, when it was over, you knew you had been in a fight. I remember at the end of the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, right along the rail back here, Charlie Norwood and Tom Coburn embracing after the debate like athletes after a great contest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whatever he did, Charlie Norwood did it cheerfully, and that is one of the main things I will remember about Charlie. He was a patriot in every sense of the word. He was a credit to  this House of Representatives. I am proud to have called him my colleague and my friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Those of us who were elected in 1994 and had the opportunity to know CHARLIE, to work with CHARLIE, and for me personally I had the opportunity to sit next to him on the Energy and Commerce Committee for about 8 years, Charlie was many things. He was a soldier in Vietnam, he was a businessman, he was a dentist, he was a great United States Congressman. He also was a Sunday school teacher at Trinity on the Hill Methodist Church in Augusta, Georgia. And I know that that church  meant a lot to him because he is asking for donations to that church as a memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently I attended a church service in a Methodist church in Kentucky, and the title of the sermon was "You Can't Make a Success of Life Without Making a Gift of It."

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about my friend, CHARLIE NORWOOD. I have prepared remarks, but I would really like to just relate like others have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first time I ran into CHARLIE I was a new freshman in this body. He sat behind me. And when you are brand new here, you are listening and you are trying to figure out what is going on. And when CHARLIE NORWOOD opened his mouth, he was saying things sometimes that others were not, and stood his ground to those things, even though they might be in conflict with both the other side and his party, both. CHARLIE had a way of standing up for his principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to talk about Gloria, because Gloria took my wife under her wing and was kind to her. And I can tell you for this last year and a half, literally every week that I have served in this Congress, my wife has asked about CHARLIE's health because she fell in love with Gloria Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone in this House sends out their hearts to Gloria at the loss of her beloved husband. We were proud to serve with him. He was a great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise to honor my friend and colleague Mr. CHARLIE NORWOOD from Northeastern Georgia who passed away yesterday morning. As a man of strong character and unwavering convictions, his passing is surely a saddening loss to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE NORWOOD served as a brave soldier during Vietnam as part of the Army Dental Corps in the 173rd Airborne Brigade. He was honored for his courageous service with the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elected to Congress in 1994, CHARLIE was the first Republican to represent his Northeastern Georgia district since Reconstruction. During his time in Congress he was known for his endless fight for the patients' bill of rights and his fight for stricter immigration policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE bravely battled cancer and lung disease, and in his final days he returned to Augusta to be with his family. The Norwood family will be in my thoughts and prayers. Please join me, Mr. Speaker, in expressing our deep appreciation for the lifetime of service by CHARLIE NORWOOD and extending our sympathies to his wife, Gloria Wilkinson Norwood, and their family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in profound sorrow and gratitude for the life of CHARLIE NORWOOD. I believe I had known CHARLIE long before I came here to meet him in person. I got to know him through C-SPAN and through the media. When I met him personally, he had matched up identically with the person that I saw through the television screen. CHARLIE had that light within him, as John Shadegg said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look back at a time when CHARLIE was not feeling well. He came here whenever it was physically possible for him to do that, and I remember a day when he looked poor, but when he spoke in that microphone right there, that light came back on again and the real CHARLIE NORWOOD again blessed this Chamber with his presence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America will always be grateful. Gloria, Marilyn and I want you to know that you and your family are in our prayers. We will always look over to this place on this floor where CHARLIE always sat and recognize that as CHARLIE's seat in the people's Chamber.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to express deep sorrow at the passing of our friend and colleague, CHARLIE NORWOOD. While most of us hope to make a difference in this world, CHARLIE NORWOOD certainly did that. He also made a difference in the lives of those who were fortunate enough to have known him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE was steadfast and did what he thought was right. He was an immovable object in the defense of principle, and when met with irresistible force, it wasn't likely that CHARLIE was the one who was moved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the development of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, I worked closely with CHARLIE and several of my colleagues to see if there was an alternative plan and how we were going to work this out. CHARLIE's contributions were insightful, they were valuable, and added considerably to the worth of our final product. During that process, he was constantly mindful of two things, and that was the need to help seniors who had no drug coverage and the need to be wise stewards for  taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coming to Congress with a medical background, CHARLIE provided a point of view that enhanced any debate he entered. While witnesses before him, at the Health Subcommittee may have cringed at times under his questioning, the responses that were drawn out always added an important dimension to our debates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE will be sorely missed: in Congress, in the Health Subcommittee, but more importantly in all our lives. I give my deepest sympathies to his wife, Gloria, his sons Charles and Carlton, and his constituents.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Latham).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400234" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the Speaker for this chance to say just a few words about my dear friend and classmate, CHARLIE NORWOOD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Gloria, to the family, we extend our most sincere, deepest condolences. Kathy and I will keep you in our prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to tell one short story about CHARLIE. When we came into Congress together back in 1994 and we had the Contract With America, the first 100 days, one of the very first votes that we had was <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>. That was an amendment to the Constitution to balance the budget. I was standing right back here at the voting machine beside CHARLIE NORWOOD. I voted "yes." CHARLIE put his card in, he voted "yes," and he turned to me and says, You know what. That's what I ran on.  I can go home now. I've done my job. I've kept my promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's what CHARLIE NORWOOD was all about. I just want to say, CHARLIE, you're home now, the Augusta, the Georgia that you love, and our thoughts and prayers will always be with you and the great honor that you have given all of us here to serve with you in this great body.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, CHARLIE NORWOOD, the man from Georgia, not just a citizen of Georgia, not just a citizen of the American South, but a citizen of the world, a man who fought the good fight, who kept the faith. He was a good and decent man, and we will never ever forget his lasting contribution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We pray for his family, for the people of his congressional district, and we pray for his soul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Lewis, for his graciousness, for his assistance in bringing this resolution to the floor, and to express my appreciation to all of our colleagues who have spoken here today. Their eloquence, I hope, conveys to Gloria and to the family the esteem with which we held CHARLIE NORWOOD. Truly the gentleman from Georgia and the blue searsucker suit is going to really be missed here, but his legacy will live  on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the responsibility of each of us to make sure that we have the same degree of commitment and passion as CHARLIE NORWOOD did. He set a great example we will all endeavor to follow.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to note the recent passing of a dear friend and colleague, CHARLIE NORWOOD. I want to extend to his wife Gloria and her sons, and their family, my deepest sympathy for their loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know how much CHARLIE loved his wife Gloria and his family.?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my colleagues today on the floor of the House to honor his service in the House of Representatives, and to honor his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE and I came to Washington with the class of 1994. We were elected to Congress in the same year and we came with the class that was going to change the way Washington operates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the seven terms that I have served with CHARLIE, I gained a lasting friendship and respect for CHARLIE. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE certainly made an impact on the House of Representatives. He always fought for the causes for which he believed, and many times we were on the same side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last year of his service, as he was battling illness, he always had a smile for me when I would speak to him. And I know that he had a smile for anyone that came to say hello.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a man of faith, I know that CHARLIE is in heaven. But for those of us who had the privilege to know him, we will miss him until we meet again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was an outstanding Congressman, and he will be missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with sorrow, yet fondness, that I speak on the passing of our colleague and friend, Charlie Norwood. While in Congress, his dedication to Georgians, to patient advocacy, to business ownership and property rights, and to veterans are legendary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to his service in the House of Representatives, CHARLIE served his country as a Captain in the U.S. Army Dental Corps in Vietnam, and he contributed to his community as a dentist, business owner, and active worshipper in his Methodist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first learned about Charlie in 1994 when he was running for his Georgia district. Struck by his pluckiness and quiet steadfast determination even then, I decided to campaign for him in his district-to-be, and met his wife Gloria. And when he was elected, he immediately became a player in health care legislation, not waiting for reaching the echelons of seniority to make real contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through all his trials, Charlie Norwood had a sparkle, an ingenuity how to get things accomplished. His passion would at times translate into defiance at another Member. In particular, I recall such a moment at the Energy &amp; Commerce markup on July 27, 2006 of <bill type="h" number="4157">H.R. 4157</bill>, the Better Health Information System Act of 2006, or "Health IT" bill. Another Member, Representative Markey, was offering some language that would have the effect of governing relations between health care  providers and their patients. Well, Charlie took great exception to this, and rather angrily erupted to Representative Markey that his profession has engaged in the highest ethical standards of patient privacy since the inception of dentistry, and therefore "I don't need you to legislate my professional ethics."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past couple of years, Charlie would ride in his scooter to the Energy &amp; Commerce Committee on which we served together, and to the Floor, for debate and hearings and votes. And notwithstanding his ailing health, I was always touched by his continued friendly, high spirits. Charlie, I am honored to have known you. Rest in peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution honoring the life of our friend and a great member of this body, Charlie Norwood, who passed away after an 8-year battle with a chronic lung disease, and then lung cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elected in 1994, Charlie was a passionate public servant who will be remembered for his dedication to health care issues and his commitment to patients' rights. A dentist by training, he had the unique perspective of understanding how health policy impacted him as a practitioner as well as his patients. His experiences were a driving force in his passionate advocacy for a patients' bill of rights, and he helped lead the effort to pass that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie also served his country in the Army for 3 years, and was a veteran of the Vietnam war. I had the privilege of getting to know Charlie when our offices were next door to each other in the Rayburn building and enjoyed our friendly visits and candid conversations. He instantly gained my respect as a hard-working and eager gentleman willing to work across party lines in search of compromIse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while Charlie's presence will be missed, his valiant spirit will live on and I am grateful for the opportunity to have served with him in this Chamber. I send my condolences and best wishes to his family, and join my colleagues in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened at the loss of a great American. Charlie Norwood was an honored member of this House of Representatives and will be deeply missed. His work for patient and individual rights showed his intense compassion for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Norwood was someone who lived the American dream. He went to college, became a dentist, fought for his country in Vietnam, and was a loving husband, father and grandfather. He served his district, state and country with distinction in the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie worked to leave the world a better place than it was given to him, and I can say that, because of his service to our country and work for health care issues, he did just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Charlie Norwood was taken from this earth too soon. My wife Diana and I extend our deepest sympathy to Gloria and the entire Norwood family in this difficult time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart today to remember a friend, and colleague--Representative Charlie Norwood of Georgia, who passed away yesterday, at his home in Augusta, Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie and I came into Congress as part of the "Republican Revolution" in 1994. We shared a common vision with the rest of our classmates of what the Federal Government should be and how it should act. Charlie worked diligently to attain this vision while serving his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this sorrowful time my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, staff and loved ones. It was an honor serving with Charlie, and he will be sorely missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a great American and a member of this House. Charles Norwood was a veteran, dentist, small business owner, and Member of Congress from Georgia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Charles Norwood was born July 27, 1941 in Valdosta, Georgia. "Charlie" as he was known, attended school in Valdosta throughout his first year of high school when his family moved to Tennessee, where he graduated in 1959 from Baylor Military High School in Chattanooga. He received his B.A. from Georgia Southern University in 1964 and a Doctorate in Dental Surgery from Georgetown University Dental School in 1967 where he was elected President of the Dental School Student Body  during his senior year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After completing dental school, Charlie Norwood enlisted in the United States Army, and was commissioned a Captain in the U.S. Army Dental Corps from 1967 to 1969. He was first assigned to the Army Dental Corps at Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1968, he was transferred to the Medical Battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in the Dental Corps, Charlie pioneered dental practices that became standard procedure after the Vietnam War. In addition to assisting the soldiers, he also provided some of the first field-based dental treatment of military guard dogs. For his distinguished service to our Nation, Charlie received the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. He was discharged in 1969 after which, he entered the private practice of dentistry in Augusta, Georgia. For many years, "Doc  Norwood" provided great service to all his patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, Charlie Norwood was elected to represent the Tenth Congressional District of Georgia in the historic 104th Congress. We were classmates because that same year I was elected to represent the citizens of the Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas. Charlie represented his district so well that he was reelected by his constituents six times and always by substantial margins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Congress, Charlie Norwood was a strong proponent for health care reform. He introduced legislation calling for a Patient's Bill of Rights. He also championed more and better health care for veterans. In addition to his work in health care reform, Norwood introduced legislation and worked on various other public-policy issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his congressional career, Charlie Norwood served on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Education and Workforce Committee. He was Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health from 2001 to 2004 and a member of the Energy and Power Subcommittee from 1997 to 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a dear colleague has fallen but he will not be forgotten. We are all saddened by our loss but we are happy to have served with him. Our prayers and condolences are with his family and loved ones. Charlie Norwood--Vietnam Veteran, dentist, small business owner, and Member of Congress--was a good representative, a good legislator, and a good man. He will be missed.</paragraph>
