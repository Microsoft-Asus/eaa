    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, taxpayers should know that Members of Congress convicted of a felony still collect their pension checks in jail. Congress took no action to kill pensions for congressional felons in February, no action in March, April or May.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Congressman Jefferson was indicted this week; and, if convicted, a nine-term Congressman would get $50,000 payments each year from the U.S. taxpayer. That would be on top of $125,000 payments to Representative Rostenkowski, $86,000 payments to Senator Durenberger, $64,000 payments to Representative Cunningham and $40,000 payments to Representative Traficant. In total, American taxpayers pay over $480,000 each year to Congressmen convicted of a felony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time for reform has come.</paragraph>
