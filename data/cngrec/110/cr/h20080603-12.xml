  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since 2006 the Democrats have been completely in control of Congress. The Democrat leadership continues to put a roadblock in the way of accessing American oil. Gas prices have doubled in the past year. At the station down the street from my home, gas is now over $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans believe in increasing production of American-made energy. Vast untapped American energy resources are currently under lock and key and off-limits. American energy resources can make our Nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans believe not only in technologies like wind, solar, and biomass but that we ought to make use of the billions of barrels of oil in Alaska, off the deep waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, and on Federal lands. We can do this in an environmentally sensitive way. And we should eliminate the red tape it takes to build a new oil refinery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should develop American-made energy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
