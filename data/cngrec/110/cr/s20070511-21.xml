    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to comment about an amendment that I offered to the bill, <bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill>, that the Senate passed on Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Researchers and clinicians continue to make significant advancements in personalized medicine. The ability to diagnose, evaluate disease susceptibility, and provide medical treatment at an individual level is made possible by powerful tools such as genetic testing, an essential component of personalized medicine. Given the complex nature of genetic testing, I am pleased that my amendment, No. 1041, to the bill was accepted. This amendment provides for a study by the highly regarded Institute  of Medicine, which will give independent, renowned, and respected experts in genetics,  genomics, and related fields the opportunity to provide their thoughtful recommendations on the best ways to further the promise of personalized medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the bill managers and their staffs for their assistance.</paragraph>
