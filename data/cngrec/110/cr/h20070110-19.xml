  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this month Democrats will take action on a bold agenda that includes all Americans. During our first 100 hours of legislative work, we are going to expand economic opportunities to millions of Americans who have been left standing in need for 6 years at least.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hardworking middle class Americans feel like they have been left behind. While CEOs see millions of dollars in bonuses and large pay increases, middle class workers have faced stagnant wages for well over 5 years. And while their wages remain virtually the same, they are trying to stretch every paycheck to better afford increasing education and health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month, Congress will give these families some much-needed help. For families trying to afford a college education for their children, we are going to cut student loan interest rates in half, which should save the average borrower about $5,000 over the life of the loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For seniors struggling to pay for high price prescription drug costs, we are going to lessen the burden by giving the Federal Government the ability to actually negotiate for lower drug prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we will give working Americans a minimum wage increase.</paragraph>
