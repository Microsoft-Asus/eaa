    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the House. I am excited to be a Democrat. I always take pleasure in giving reasons for why I am a member of the Democratic Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since taking control of Congress, Democrats have worked to pass legislation that will help families once again live the American Dream. Over the last 6 years, college costs have shot up 40 percent, putting higher education out of reach for most Americans. I have one son in college today, and I can tell you I am excited over the fact that we passed, and the President did, in fact, sign the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This law is the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill.  It strengthens the middle class by cutting interest rates in half and subsidizes student loans over the next 5 years. We are also able, in this bill, to increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarships by $500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased and I am excited to be a Democrat.</paragraph>
