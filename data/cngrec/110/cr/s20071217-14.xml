    <paragraph>Mr. President, with the passage of the farm bill, I want to commend the work of my legislative staff led by Kasey Gillette our senior legislative assistant. Kasey did an excellent job on both substance and strategy always focusing on how the bill would impact farm families and the agricultural economy of Pennsylvania. Kasey had two great teammates: Caryn Long and Alex Davis, who labored for months on very complex matters in the bill. Without the work of Kasey, Caryn, and Alex, I wouldn't  have been able to have four amendments adopted during the floor debate and five others adopted during the committee markup.</paragraph>
