  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats are as predictable as the sun: it continues to rise in the east, and they continue to tax and spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic budget released last week proposes the largest tax increase in American history: $392.5 billion. Not only does it allow for the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, but it does nothing to control unsustainable entitlement spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans believe fiscal restraint and pro-growth economic policies will lead to budget surpluses and new jobs. Democrats believe out-of-control government spending should be subsidized with the hard-earned money of American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Democratic budget continues to squeeze taxpayers' pocketbooks without tightening the belt of Big Government. Such reckless policies will chill our growing economy by reducing job creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
