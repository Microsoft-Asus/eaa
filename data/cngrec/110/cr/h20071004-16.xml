    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the liberals' fraudulent attacks on Rush Limbaugh. Anyone who reads the widely available transcript as I have done sees that Mr. Limbaugh was appropriately referring to the pretenders who pose as medal winners or who falsely claim to have committed atrocities in Iraq when he used the phrase "phony soldiers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, the real scandal here is that liberals in America and here in this Congress are willing to manipulate facts to smear those they disagree with. But there's an even more insidious agenda by liberals going on and that is to reinstitute the so-called Fairness Doctrine, which is actually a way to silence conservatives on the radio waves. Mr. Limbaugh deserves mega-kudos for being a forceful and effective voice on the side of common sense and for being an example of the first amendment in action.  After all, isn't that what our country is supposed to be about?</paragraph>
