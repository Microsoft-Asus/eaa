  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO GREG MADDUX -- (Senate - December 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10823">S10823</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a little boy in Searchlight, as I was growing up, I used to listen every day to the "Game of the Day" baseball on the radio, and because there was no entertainment in Searchlight, I loved those games. I listened to them. Dizzy Dean was one of the announcers, and a guy named Al Helfer was one of the announcers. I thought they were very good, very entertaining. In the seventh inning stretch, Dizzy would always sing "The Wabash Cannonball."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in my youthful mind, one thing I wanted to do more than anything else was to be a baseball player. In Searchlight, we tried to play baseball. We had a little field there. We did not have enough boys for the team, so we had one girl who made up the nine players. Her name was Mary Ann Meyers. She still lives in Searchlight. She was really quite good--frankly, better than a lot of the boys. She rode a horse bareback as well as anyone could ride with a saddle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spent a lot of my daydreaming playing baseball. I had a little paddle of some kind, and I would throw rocks in the air and hit them with that. That was part of my entertainment. I did that for a long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As they had no high school in Searchlight, I went to Basic High School in Henderson, NV, which was 45 miles away. I stayed with people during the week and would come home on a lot of weekends if I could. They did not have a freshman baseball team. They had no baseball team. I guess maybe if there had been a freshman good enough--I do not really think that was the case; I do not think they let freshmen be on the baseball team. My sophomore year, I went out for baseball. I was one of two sophomores  to make that team. It was so exciting for me. That team was so good, we were so good, we won the Nevada State Championship. The first year they had a championship, we won. We beat Fallon. We had a pitcher by the name of Rey Martinez who later became my chief of staff and was a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I would like to stand before everybody here and say that one reason that was the case is I was instrumental in getting hits at the right time and making stellar plays, stealing bases as I dreamed I would do as a kid. But I sat on the bench most of the time. I caught batting practice. I was a catcher. But I felt that I was part of that team and will never forget my experiences there playing baseball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend Don Wilson, who was the other sophomore, was a State batting champion. He was terrific, a great athlete. He went on the play at Arizona State. But we had tremendous athletes. We had Norman Craft, who was our center fielder, who was a Big 10 football player playing at Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went to college on a football-baseball scholarship. I was a lot bigger then than I am now. I weighed almost 190 pounds. But I got hurt early in my college athletic career--meaning football--and I came to the realization that I was not the athlete of my dreams. I was not big enough, fast enough, or good enough. So my athletic career, as a freshman in college, ended. I fought after that, but not as the baseball-football player I dreamed of being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I mention all of this today is to tell everyone within the sound of my voice how much I love baseball. I love athletics. I think it is so good and it is so wonderful that women can now participate just like men--boys and girls can participate. When I was in high school, the only thing my wife could do--she was far more athletic than I am or I was--is be a cheerleader. That was all she could do. There was not a single program for girls. So now we have programs equally for girls and  boys, and that is exiting and wonderful, and I am happy that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I mention all of this today is that yesterday in Las Vegas was a very big day for people who love baseball. It was an important day, but in some ways it was kind of a sentimental day because the great Greg Maddux announced his retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gregg Maddux, one of the greatest baseball players of all time, announced  his retirement yesterday after 23 seasons in the big leagues. Greg Maddux announced his retirement. He is such a fine person, unassuming. We see all of the negative things about athletes today, their taking steroids and fighting at bars and carrying guns into bars and shooting themselves in the leg and having dogs fight each other, not setting good examples for kids as to how  they treat women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greg Maddux stood for everything that they didn't--a wonderful family man, beautiful children, who prizes his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a speech about some guy who played baseball in Las Vegas. This is a statement about one of the greatest baseball players of all time. You take the thousands of people who have pitched in the big leagues, Greg Maddux, this small man, relatively small man, who never lifted a weight in his life, is eighth on the all-time list of pitchers, Cy Young, go down the list, Warren Spahn, Greg Maddux; he is 10 games away from being in the top four or five--10 wins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another reason it is so important is that Greg Maddux is from Las Vegas. He never left. He went away for 23 years, spent half the year playing baseball, sometimes more than that, but he always came home. Las Vegas is home. That is where his kids go to school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a statement about a wonderful man who is a role model for anyone who participates in athletics but also someone Nevada is very proud of. He went to Valley High School, a high school that is still there. There are wonderful stories about this boy who went to that high school. A columnist from a prominent newspaper--I think that is where it was--a few years ago wrote a story, a column about Greg Maddux. He was a senior in high school. They had this skinny little sophomore who was going  to pitch against him and his team. And he looked forward to batting against this skinny little sophomore who was pitching for Valley High School. And he describes in the column he wrote, he struck out every time he got up against this guy and they were, of course, beaten. Stories like that are all over Nevada about what he did in his youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greg will soon be 43 years old. Yesterday he held a press conference. In effect what he said is: Thank you to everybody in baseball. He said: I still think I could play this game but not as well as I would like to, so it is time to say goodbye. And that is what he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His accomplishments are legendary; 355 games he won. He won more games than Roger Clemens, and he did it without taking any supplements of any kind. I repeat what he told me. He said: You know, I have never lifted a weight. He said: When I was in high school, a physical therapist said: Don't mess with your body. And Gregg may have pushed a few weights with his legs, but no way did he touch his arm, not because his arm had such great power, because he didn't throw as hard as a lot of pitchers,  but his accuracy was nearly perfect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the seven men in front of him on the victory list, only Warren Spahn pitched in the second half of the last century. He is the only 300 game winner to have more than 3,000 strikeouts and less than 1,000 walks. He averaged less than 30 walks per year. That is a remarkable accomplishment; the first player in the history of baseball to win at least 15 games in 17 straight years; the only player in the history of baseball to win 13 games over 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He won four straight Cy Young awards. He won a World Series with the Atlanta Braves. He won 18 Gold Gloves. What is a Gold Glove? That means you are the best fielder in baseball at that position. He won 18 of them. No one will ever match that. That is for his fielding excellence. That is the most of any player ever, 18 Gold Gloves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How did he do this, a man who didn't throw that hard, wasn't a monster on the mound being 6 foot 9? He was about my size, a little heavier than I am. He was able to do that because of his consistency, his control, and his mental acuity. He studied those batters. He knew their weaknesses and their strengths, and everyone marveled at how he could throw that baseball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stories will go on and on about Greg Maddux, but one story is not legend. It is true. For a sportswriter's entertainment, he said: Have the catcher hold up his glove and then we will make sure the catcher can't see so he can't move his hand. Let's see if you can hit that glove.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about that. The catcher is, in effect, blindfolded. He didn't do it once. He did it three times. Think about that. For those of us who have ever thrown a baseball, to hit that target is pretty significant. He is a man of humility. I just am so proud of Greg Maddux. I don't know what team I am going to root for now, because when he was with the Cubs, I was a Cub fan. When he was with the Atlanta Braves, I was a Braves fan. As difficult as it was playing for those losers, the Padres; they  wouldn't get him any runs, I followed them because I knew Greg Maddux was on that team. And then he went with the Dodgers, and I became a Dodger fan. I don't know who I am going to cheer for. I really don't know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His brother is a wonderful man. He was a long-time pitching coach for the Milwaukee Brewers. He has now, I understand, gone with the Texas Rangers. Whenever he came to town, I tried to visit with him. He was also a major league pitcher, 5 or 6 years older than his little brother Greg, but always looked out for him and was always so proud of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want the record to reflect that America lost from baseball a great human being yesterday. But for us in Nevada, the place of his home, we still have Greg Maddux. His ties to Las Vegas make us all so very proud. Local historians will say--and rightfully so--that Greg Maddux is the greatest athlete in the history of our State.</paragraph>
