  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration <bill type="hr" number="1091">H. Res. 1091</bill>, which seeks to recognize the life of Charlton Heston for his accomplishments both and off the big screen. Not only did Heston command an overwhelming presence in theaters, but his actions in support of the civil rights movement during the 1960s and on behalf of other social causes throughout his life deserve recognition. For example, Charlton Heston joined Martin  Luther King, Jr., in the march on Washington, D.C. in 1963, and was an early civil rights activist long before Hollywood found it fashionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1091">H. Res. 1091</bill> was introduced by Representative DON YOUNG of Alaska on April 8, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on April 16, 2008, by voice vote after being amended by the panel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure has the support of well over 100 Members of Congress and is evidence of a wide, national appreciation for the enduring legacy that this great American citizen left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Heston was born on October 4, 1923, in No Man's Land, Illinois. In 1944, Heston enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, spending 2 years of his life as a B-25 radio operator and gunner in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August of 2002, after a long and illustrious acting career, Heston publicly announced that he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In 2003, Mr. Heston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in commemoration of the positive impact he has had on our culture and country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In memory of his life of greatness and activism, I urge swift passage of <bill type="hr" number="1091">H. Res. 1091</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, rather than my making a statement, I would like to yield to the sponsor of the resolution, our very distinguished veteran, Mr. Young from Alaska, and just advise him I am going to yield him such time as he may consume, letting him know that the former chairman of the Rules Committee would like some time as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman of the subcommittee and Mr. Shays and the chairman of the full committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is indeed an honor that I will speak on Charlton Heston today. We have already heard some of the roles that he played in "Planet of the Apes," "Julius Caesar," "Antony and Cleopatra," "Omega Man," and I can go on down the line. His famous roles, of course, were Moses, Michelangelo, Andrew Jackson, John the Baptist, Mark Antony, El Cid, and Ben Hur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people may not remember his role in politics. He became very active as president of the Screen Actors Guild. Before every actor in the world got involved politically, he was involved in the Screen Actors Guild. He was also very active and involved, as mentioned by the chairman, in civil rights. He marched with Martin Luther King. And one of my interests was that he enlisted in the Army Air Force in World War II and served 2 years as a B-25 gunner in the Aleutian chain, a God-awful place  it was, but part of my great State of Alaska, and defended against the enemy at that time with great honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had two children. He married the love of his life, Lydia Clarke, in 1944, and was married to her for the rest of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was the president of the NRA from June 1998 until April 2003, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say I knew him personally. I never called him Chuck or Charles, it was always Mr. Heston or Mr. President because he was president of an organization which I am very proud of, and that is the NRA, the National Rifle Association. He probably did more to protect the freedoms of America in his actions as president of that organization than any other individual. And that may not be proper with certain people in this body, but he did guarantee us, through the second amendment, the right  to protect ourselves, the right to protect the castle which we live in, the right to be able to protect those that we love against those who would do us harm. He believed in it, as I believe in it. It is very, very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If America were to recognize one individual who probably contributed most to our individual freedoms, it would be Charlton Heston.</paragraph>
