  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I strongly support legislation introduced earlier today which would permit Federal funding to be used for embryonic stem cell research. That is a subject which has been at the top of my agenda since November of 1998 when stem cells were first exposed. Within 10 days, in December 1998, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education held the first hearing to explore the potential of embryonic stem cell research. In the intervening years  the subcommittee has held some 19 hearings exploring this issue in some great detail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Specter-Harkin bill was passed last year, vetoed by the President, and the bill is back before the Congress this year where it may be possible to override a Presidential veto. That depends upon how much public support there is--really, how much public clamor there is--for this legislation to be enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Embryonic stem cells have the potential to replace diseased cells. They are a veritable fountain of youth. They have enormous potential in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease, and almost all of the known maladies. I don't know of any malady where they are not a potential for a cure because the cells in a person's body become diseased, and if the embryonic stem cell can replace the diseased cell, there is a potential for a cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is opposition to this legislation on the ground that it would destroy life. That is factually not correct because there are some 400,000 embryos created for in vitro fertilization which are going to be destroyed. When the issue was raised about destroying a life, the subcommittee took the lead and appropriated $2 million to facilitate adoptions. There have only been about 100 adoptions in the past several years, so there is no doubt that using some of these embryonic stem cells will not  destroy life because they will not be used to create life. If there were any chance they would create life, I would not consider utilizing them for medical research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the alternative is to throw them away or to use them, it seems to me a clear choice to utilize them to save lives and fight disease. That is the thrust of this legislation.</paragraph>
