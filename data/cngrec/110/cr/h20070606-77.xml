  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tonight I come to the floor with several of my colleagues over the next hour to recognize that while even tonight we've heard these divisions on the floor from both parties and Members in each party that have differences of opinion about Iraq and the war, we come tonight to talk about the threats around the world that continue to emerge, that are real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But before we get to the discussion about those threats and global security and the need for our country to be the leader of all of civilization, civilized countries versus, frankly, uncivilized, organizations, factions, even countries around the world who actually believe that blowing themselves up somehow is right or just. This is the struggle, and I do not think we can afford to deny the threats. I want to start first, though, by honoring the people who are volunteering to this very day to  put themselves between the threat in our civilian population and serve in the uniform of our Armed Forces, first and foremost, the ones that have actually given their life for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, over the Memorial Day district work period, I joined the families of two heroic East Tennesseans, one here in Washington at Arlington National Cemetery as I left. Sergeant First Class James David Tiger Connell, Jr., of Lake City, Tennessee, was laid to rest here in Arlington a week ago Friday for answering the Scriptural call that "no greater love hath any man than to lay down his life for a friend." And then on Memorial Day, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I joined the family of Private  First Class Travis Haslip from Ooltewah, Tennessee, to lay his body to rest. Two great American heroes who joined six other heroes from my district who have given their life for us. And contrary to what some people say, they not only did not die in vain, they joined the ranks of the greatest Americans ever who were willing to give their life for the cause of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They were willing to lay it all on the line for the principles that this country holds so dear, knowing that every generation sooner or later has to face threats like this and somebody has to go and answer the call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you believe they died in vain, then many, many, many others through other wars throughout the history of our country also did, and I don't believe it for a second, because I know that it is those patriotic Americans that have paid the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to honor tonight Sergeant Paul Thompson III of Jefferson City, Tennessee; Sergeant First Class Stephen Curtis Kennedy of Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Sergeant David Thomas Weir of Cleveland, Tennessee, and I want to talk about his mom in a minute; Staff Sergeant Daniel M. Morris of Clinton, Tennessee; Sergeant John Michael Sullivan of Hixon, Tennessee; and Sergeant Terrance W. Prater of Speedwell, Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say that Jackie Weir, Sergeant David Weir's mom, wrote me a letter which I received over the Memorial Day weekend. This incredible mom has on the bottom of her letterhead a quote from General George S. Patton. It says, "It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather, we should thank God that such men lived." This is on her letterhead. She gave her son for our country and its future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This coming Monday, I will be privileged to join my nephew with the 181st Field Artillery Brigade as they deploy for Iraq from Chattanooga. Jeffrey Watts is my nephew, so a member of our family is going as well. May God be with all of them, protect them and strengthen them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because, as John Stuart Mill once said, "War is an ugly thing, but it is not the ugliest of things." He said, "The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse." He said, "A person who has nothing for which they are willing to fight, nothing they care more about than their own personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of ever being free unless those very freedoms are made and kept by better persons than himself."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is etched in my memory, because I don't believe everything John Stewart Miller ever wrote, but I agree with that, that the alternative to war sometimes is complete loss of freedom, and it is tyranny, and it is terror all the time, and it is oppression. Without the courage to fight and stand up, that is where we may end up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is easy to forget the timeline. I want to go through it. Then I want to recognize the gentleman from Michigan. The timeline though goes back a long time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We sure better not ignore these threats. We better stand in the gap for the next generation and quit denying that these threats are mounting against us. I don't want our country to be the last country in the world willing to face this reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan, the Chairman of the Policy Committee here among Republican Members of the House, Thaddeus McCotter, an expert on these issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, amidst these tumultuous times, it is often difficult to make sense of the stakes and the situations which confront us. But let us be clear: America in Iraq faces the prospect of a defeat, with consequences not only for this present generation of Americans but for future generations of Americans as well. Unlike Vietnam, the enemy will follow us home; and this is an enemy that is bent upon our destruction and the death not only of ourselves but of everything we hold dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In similar times, as my colleague PHIL ENGLISH, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, earlier read, it was the moral clarity of individuals like President Roosevelt, who helped guide the greatest generation to their triumph over abject evil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This generation of Americans must retain their moral clarity to understand what needs to be done in the perilous present to get us to a better tomorrow. First, we need to step back and assess the situation in Iraq. The reality in Iraq is that we have one thing left to do as a Nation, and that job has been entrusted to our troops, who have done everything and more that has been asked of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, Iraq is free, Iraq is sovereign, Iraq has a democratically elected government. The people of Iraq within the government are fighting side by side with United States forces to kill and capture al Qaeda and other terrorists and insurgents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And today we find ourselves struggling to attain the last goal before our troops accomplish the mission, and that is to give the new democracy a chance to survive in our absence. I say a chance to survive in our absence, because no free people, including ourselves, can ever be guaranteed that their liberty will last in perpetuity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did not Benjamin Franklin tell us this when he said to his fellow patriots at the founding of our Nation, we will give you a republic, if you can keep it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of keeping that republic, or of any free nation, is eternal vigilance, to make sure that your rights are not eroded and you are not enslaved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At another time in our Nation's history, when we were sorely tried through the conflagration of war, it was President Lincoln who understood that a war for secession had become a war for the emancipation of an entire race so that our Nation could have a new birth of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we find in the Middle East today as we struggle to accomplish the last task in this mission is that our war for terror has been transformed into the war for the emancipation of millions of Muslims, so that the Middle East and our world can have a new birth of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we, as a nation conceived in liberty, who have seen the sorrowful sacrifice of so many of our sons and daughters throughout our history to retain that liberty, determine to turn our backs upon people we have given a cruel sip of freedom to before we abandon them, we must ask ourselves two questions: What do we as a nation believe anymore about ourselves and the inalienable truths upon which we were founded; and what manner of dedication can we portray to the world and to ourselves as to its  preservation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And then we must ask ourselves a very cruel question: What other nascent democracies under terrorist attack will the United States abandon? Because that is the question that the enemy wants us to confront in what they are doing in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the United States is defeated in Iraq, and make no mistake, with the euphemisms that are bandied about, if we leave we lose, and the terrorists will remind us of this. The gutter snipe, Osama bin Laden, will be more than happy to proclaim it through every Internet site and every broadcast media available to him and his ilk for domestic American consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we leave and are defeated in Iraq, everything that the enemy has done in Iraq will be transferred to Afghanistan. Already, as we found out earlier today, we have seen the hand of the Iranians in putting exploding devices and other material to support the Taliban insurgents against the NATO forces and our own U.S. troops who are part of that coalition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us not forget that it was in Afghanistan that al Qaeda, and especially bin Laden and others, learned to kill as they chased the Soviets out through  measures that they are now applying in Iraq and Afghanistan. And let us not forget that an emboldened enemy will then, on much more familiar ground where the al Qaeda was housed before the attacks of September 11, it will prove a much more fertile ground for their incipient brand of insurgency, which  we will have already been unable to quell in Iraq, which will now devolve into chaos and prove a safe haven for those who wish to kill us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let us not forget, we have one thing left to do in Iraq. That is why it is so bloody, that is why it is so bitter, and that is why it is so frustrating to the vast majority of Americans. But if we maintain our prudence and perseverance and clarity, we can see this through until the mission is accomplished. We can see that the United States, which is a revolutionary experiment in human freedom, can remember the lesson that Lincoln taught us: When we extend liberty to the enslaved, we ensure  liberty for ourselves. President Lincoln understood that liberty is not static. It does not remain in a perpetual stasis where we can enjoy our liberty while others have it denied unto them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If freedom is advancing or eroding in the course of human events, let us rededicate ourselves not only to accomplishing the mission in Iraq and Afghanistan so that our world can experience a new birth of freedom, let us rededicate ourselves to the proposition that we who are born into freedom also bear the responsibility where we can to extend liberty to those who also yearn to breathe free, as do all of God's creatures.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all desire a better course in Iraq. We all desire changes, not just General Petraeus' leadership and the increase in security forces from our country necessary to prevail in Iraq, but even more regional cooperation, and some of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group so that people in this country will truly recognize, especially in the Congress, that this is not our President's war. This is our country's war. This is our country's fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now a very prominent person from my State wrote a book called "The Inconvenient Truth." He wrote it about the environment, but I have to say tonight on the floor of the House that a bigger inconvenient truth than the one he wrote about is the inconvenient truth that is lost around here a lot, that over half of the Democratic Members of the United States Senate and almost half of the United States House of Representatives voted to remove Saddam Hussein by force. Now, many people are running  from that commitment and decision, but it is an inconvenient truth that they said it needed to be done and they committed us to doing it. And we went as a nation and there was not that much criticism as there is now, but it is convenient to blame or cast aspersions</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have two pages, and I am not going to go through these quotes like I did the time line, but two pages of quotes from the most prominent leaders in the Democratic Party in this country saying why Saddam Hussein had to be removed by force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The quotes I will go through tonight, though, are from the terrorists themselves because I think they must be quoted so we understand what they are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zawahiri, al Qaeda's top leader in the region now, we don't know where Osama bin Laden is, but Zawahiri said, "The jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached its peak with the two blessed raids on New York and Washington. And now it is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and even the crusaders' own homes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Manar said, "Let the entire world hear me. Our hostility to the Great Satan, America, is absolute. Regardless of how the world has changed after September 11, death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: Death to America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zarqawi said, "They are aware that if this Islamic giant wakes up, it will not be satisfied with less than the gates of Rome, Washington, Paris, and London."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bin Laden's top lieutenant said, "The fire has not and will not be put out, and our swords, which have been colored with your blood, are thirsty for more of your rotting heads."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leader of Hezbollah said, "We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are most vulnerable. The Jews love life; so that is what we shall take from them. We are going to win because they love life and we love death."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zawahiri said, "Knights under the prophet's banner, al Qaeda's most important short-term strategic goal is to seize control of the state, or part of a state, somewhere in the Muslim world." He wrote, "Confronting the enemies of Islam and launching jihad against them require a Muslim authority established on Muslim land. Without achieving this, our actions will mean nothing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osama bin Laden said, "The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries. It is either victory and glory or misery and humiliation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osama bin Laden has said, "The most important and serious issue today for the world is this Third World War." That's what he said. "It is raging in the land of the two rivers, Iraq. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the words of jihad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before yielding to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, I would like to encourage people to open a book called "America Alone" by Mark Steyn. The gentlewoman has just finished the book. It is on our reading list as we are trying to educate Members of the House on the threats. We all know you can't believe everything you read. But if you do your homework and you follow people who do their research, reading is the best way to understand this threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say first, I am for pluralism. Every religious view is welcomed in this country, period. We are tolerant. It is a tenet of our foundation, religious pluralism is the American way. We do not believe in theocracy. It doesn't come with freedom, not our way. But let me say tonight, and this may not be popular in some quarters, that is not the Muslim way today. It is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Islamists, the radicals, are insulated within Islam and they are not being challenged by the rest of Islam. And they call for a global sharia. That is Islamic rule. There were challenges all around the world right now about whether Islamic law, their law, a theocratic system, trumps the laws of any country, including this country. And if you don't think this is infiltrating most of the countries around the world, you are not paying any attention. This threat is growing and rising.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All you have to do is study the demographics that are articulated in this book and you realize that countries like our and Japan and Russia, they are actually declining in population. Our country is barely growing. The most rapid growth in the world is among the Muslim countries. Sheer demographics overtake us if the radicals continue to be insulated within Islam and not challenged because the numbers are exponential in terms of how many people are now willing to kill themselves for a cause.  I could spend the rest of the night going through the latest statistics which ought to shock every American, that 26 or 30 percent, depending on two different questions, of Muslims in this country, many of whom are citizens, believe it is acceptable, this is scientific polling 2 weeks ago, it is acceptable to blow yourself up for a cause. That's a problem. I have to tell you, that is not acceptable in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not acceptable that jihadism is fashionable or a way of life. How many people in the Muslim world now think that 9/11 was justified. I have to tell you, America is not perfect, we have made mistakes; but anybody in the world who apologizes for our country is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And these apologists who somehow blame us for what happened are wrong. Many others are here to speak. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Wamp for organizing this hour tonight and bringing together a group of folks who have similar feelings to his. I see several of my colleagues have joined us and so I  won't take a lot of time. It is always hard to follow such eloquent speakers as Congressman McCotter and Congressman Wamp. They are both eloquent people, and I am pleased to be with them to add my few comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congressman Wamp has said, I have been reading "America Alone." I want to recommend it. It is written by Mark Steyn, S-T-E-Y-N. It is an excellent book. It is very, very readable, and it is very, very frightening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congressman Wamp said, if you don't do anything but pay attention to the demographics, you will have your attention gotten by this book. As he indicated, the United States of America is the only western country that is replacing itself in terms of population. It takes a birth rate of 2.1 to replace the population. What is happening in Canada, which I wasn't aware of, Canada has a birth rate of about 1.3 right now, 1.4. All of the European countries have birth rates of 1.3, 1.4, 1.2.  Their populations are going to be cut in half within 35 years. That is something that has never happened in the history of humanity. Their populations are going to be cut in half; and yet the Muslim populations are growing anywhere from 4.7 percent to over 7 percent which means their populations are going to double in a very short period of time. And fairly soon, all of Europe is going to be predominantly Muslim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The title of the book, "America Alone," we are going to be the only country in the free world that is increasing our population of people with western ideals, western religions and western thought. That is something we really have to be thinking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been troubled, and I have spoken about this before, about statements that have been made by Democrats in this body when we talk about the war that we are in. They talk about failure. They talk about it being an impossible situation. Well, I want to try to tie this in to what Congressman McCotter was saying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I meet with people and they ask me about the, quote, "war in Iraq," I quickly say to them as kindly and as nicely as I can, we are not in a war in Iraq, we are in a war for the freedom of this country and the freedom of the world. If we lose this war, we are losing to radical jihadists who see that we have only two choices. We either convert to becoming Muslims or we should be killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now as Congressman Wamp says, we believe in pluralism in this country. We believe in inviting people to come to this country, worship as they please, but not to come here and try to impose their idea, their radical idea of the world on us. So I think it is very important that we all do that. We understand this is a war for freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This country is the beacon of freedom in the world, and failure is simply not possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very troubled again by the talk by Senators in the Democratic party who say the war is lost. It cannot be lost again. If it is, then we will go out of existence as a society and as a culture. We can't do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that we're fighting against extremists. There's Sunnis, there's Shias and there's al Qaeda and their intent to fortify their influence in the Middle East and expand beyond it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats have claimed that a recently declassified National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the war in Iraq has made the war on terror more difficult to win, even though the terrorists see the war in Iraq and the war against terrorists as one and the same. They see it that way. We do not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the NIE actually concluded that, should Jihadists be perceived to have failed in their efforts to undermine democracy in Iraq, "fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have to defeat the terrorists. We have to defeat them not only in Iraq but in Afghanistan, in New York City, in New Jersey, anywhere that we find them. Because that is our mission, and that is what we're here for. If we don't want to see freedom and our way of life destroyed, then it's our responsibility to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will tell you that I am not going to allow the brave men and women who are fighting to maintain our freedom to think that all Members of Congress have no backbone and are weak-kneed and look only to political advantage. I want them to know that there's some Members of Congress who appreciate what they're doing, who understand the sacrifice that they're making and understand the consequences of our winning or losing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most articulate and knowledgeable Members of the U.S. House of Representatives on radical Islam is Representative TRENT FRANKS from Arizona, and I yield to him.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400141" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. As usual, he's always more kind than he should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, as we embrace the grave responsibility of discussing an issue that will have a profound impact on future American generations, it seems very appropriate to remind ourselves of the ideal that gave birth to the United States in the very first place. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It puts us all on even ground, Mr. Speaker, but, whether we realize it or not, most of the important discussions in this Chamber, including the one in this moment, center around whether we still believe those words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these hours, America finds herself at war with an inexpressibly dangerous ideology that is the antithesis of those words and everything that is the American ideal. What concerns me most, Mr. Speaker, is that this is a war between an ideology that is committed to the death and destruction of freedom and the subjugation of the entire world and is one waged against the world's free people who still remain primarily asleep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this ideological war did not begin on 9/11. It began many years ago when certain Muslim extremists embraced a divergent Islamist dogma that dictates that all infidels must die. It was called then, as it should be now, Jihad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the same Jihadist ideology that murdered Israeli athletes in 1972; that took American hostages in Iran; that murdered Marines in their barracks in 1983; that bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, Riyadh in 1995, the Khobar towers in 1996, the embassy in 1998, the U.S.S. Cole in 2000; and that brutally murdered scores of little children on their opening day of school in Beslan, Russia. And then, Mr. Speaker, this same dark ideology massacred nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ideology of Islamist Jihad leads to the practice of decapitating humanitarians with hacksaws on television while the victims scream for mercy. Just last month, one of those most recent videos on the Internet showed a member of the Taliban beheading a man accused of spying. That member of the Taliban was 12 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that is a wake-up call to this planet if we will only listen. This same hatred causes Islamic Jihadists to cowardly hide behind women and children while launching rockets deliberately targeting innocent civilians, and continually breaking treaties of peace, and forcing children to blow themselves to pieces to effect the murder of other innocents, and all this while their mothers scream for joy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we anticipate future actions of the Jihadists, we should consider, as Mr. Wamp has so eloquently said earlier today, the words of the terrorists themselves. And at the risk of repeating some of the things that Congressman Wamp said, I believe that these kinds of words are so important for America and for the people in this body to hear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Qaeda's Al-Zawahiri said this. He said, "The Jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached its peak with the two blessed raids on New York and Washington. And now it is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and even within the Crusaders' own homes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Manar said on BBC, "Let the entire world hear me. Our hostility to the Great Satan, America, is absolute. Regardless of how the world has changed after 11 September, Death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: Death to America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Zarqawi said this of America's leaders, "They are aware that if the Islamic giant wakes up it will not be satisfied with less than the gates of Rome, Washington, Paris, and London."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Muhajir, Osama bin Laden's latest lieutenant in Iraq, said this. He said, "The fire has not and will not be put out and our swords, which have been colored with your blood, are thirsty for more of your rotting heads."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said this, "We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are the most vulnerable. The Jews love life, so that is what we shall take away from them. We are going to win because they love life and we love death."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, then we hear Democrats in this body say things like, "The savagery of the terrorists is not relevant," or even the most senior Democrat in this House is quoted as saying, "I don't take sides for or against Hezbollah, or for or against Israel." The senior Democrat in the other body said, "This war is lost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, that kind of blind relativism that deliberately ignores all truth and equates merciless terrorism with free nations defending themselves and their innocent citizens is more dangerous to humanity than terrorism itself, and it is proof that liberals completely misunderstand the enemy that we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osama bin Laden's deputy, Al-Zawahiri, said this. He made it clear in his book, Knights Under the Prophet's Banner, al Qaeda's most important short-term strategic goal is to seize control of a state, or part of a state, somewhere in the Muslim world. He wrote, "Confronting the enemies of Islam and launching Jihad against them require a Muslim authority, established on Muslim land. Without achieving this goal, our actions will mean nothing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For God's sake, I hope we're listening to people like that. Mr. Speaker, such a Jihadist state would be the ideal launching pad for future attacks on the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bin Laden himself has stated, "The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries. It's either victory and glory, or misery and humiliation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the terrorists regard Iraq as their central front in their war against humanity; and if we're to understand our enemy and this war, we must recognize Iraq as the central front in our war against Jihad. Our courageous and noble soldiers understand that, and our enemy certainly understands that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osama bin Laden himself said, "The most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this Third World War. It is raging in the land of the two rivers, Iraq. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if Democrats are correct that this struggle in Iraq is not crucial to winning the war against Islamist Jihad, then for God's sake I wish they would explain that to the terrorists, because they don't understand it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brink Lindsey put this all succinctly. He said, "Here is the grim truth: We are only one act of madness away from a social cataclysm unlike anything our country has ever known. After a handful of such acts, who knows what kind of civilizational breakdown might be in store?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot deny that we are fighting a war against an insidiously dangerous and evil ideology that is bent on the destruction of the Western World, and they would like nothing better than to decapitate this country by detonating a nuclear blast 100 yards from here. To allow Jihadists to declare victory in Iraq will serve only to hasten such a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The free nations of the world once had opportunity to address the insidious rise of the Nazi ideology in its formative years when it could have been dispatched without great cost. But they delayed, and the result was atomic bombs falling on cities in the world, 50 million people dead worldwide, and the swastika's shadow nearly plunging the planet into Cimmerian night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Jihadists believe they have a critical advantage over the free world. They believe their will is stronger than ours and that they need only to persevere; and, Mr. Speaker, the words of neutrality and retreat have only encouraged them in that belief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must realize that this is a war that is fundamentally a battle between good and evil, between light and darkness, between individual freedom and totalitarian repression; and we must realize that our enemy is absolutely blinded with an absolute hate for all the Western World.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also recognize that America is the flagship of human freedom, and if America allows terrorists to conquer us both on the battlefield and in our will to fight the result will be that humanity will be left to face a future that is dark beyond expression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think that probably Ronald Reagan could close this in the best way. He said to our soldiers who nobly fought in Vietnam, "Let us tell those who fought in that war that we will never again ask young men to fight and possibly die in a war our government is afraid to win."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I'm afraid sometimes that we forget the heroism of the past. So let me just close with a prayer that one of our great Presidents, Franklin Roosevelt, said many years ago, as today we mark the 63rd anniversary of the D-Day invasion to liberate Europe from Hitler's fascism. U.S. forces alone sustained over 6,500 casualties in that 1 day, twice what we've endured in 5 years in Iraq. Knowing the gravity of the operation, Franklin Roosevelt, one of the Nation's most liberal Presidents, said and  allow me to close in those words:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the haven of home. Some will never return. Embrace these, Father,  and receive them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom. And for us at home, fathers, mothers, children, wives, sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, help us, Almighty God, to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of great sacrifice. And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade. Thy will be done, Almighty God. Amen."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every Member of this body has an obligation to do their best to share their beliefs in what they think we face with the American people and their constituents. I believe that this problem in Iraq that we've got to do better with is not the end of this at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some reason, God spared us again with the JFK plot and allowed us to actually interdict that before another September 11 or even worse happened. For some reason, He granted us grace, but it is a matter of time, given the conflicts that we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the people, this Iraq conflict is a chapter in the war that is mounted against us, and it's not the end, anymore than the first bombing in 1993 of the World Trade Center was the end. We denied that it happened, but we weren't willing to address it, and September 11 happened. But Iraq is no different in the long-term conflict which is a generational struggle with radical Islam.</paragraph>
