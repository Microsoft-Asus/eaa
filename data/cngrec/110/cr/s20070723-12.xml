    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 207(c) of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the section 207(b) discretionary spending limits and allocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for legislation reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee that provides a certain level of funding for fiscal year 2008 for four program integrity initiatives. The initiatives are continuing disability reviews  and supplemental security income redeterminations, Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement, health care fraud and abuse control, and unemployment insurance improper payment reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008, on June 27, 2007. That bill contains provisions that fulfill the conditions of section 207(c) for adjustments related to continuing disability reviews and supplemental secrity income redeterminations, health care fraud and abuse control, and unemployment insurance improper payment reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2008, on July 13, 2007. That bill contains provisions that fulfill the conditions of section 207(c)  for Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, for fiscal year 2008, I am revising both the discretionary spending limits and the allocation to the Senate Appropriations Committee for discretionary budget authority and outlays. The amount of the adjustment is $1,042 million in budget authority and $699 million in outlays. The revised discretionary limits and allocations for discretionary budget authority and outlays are the appropriate levels to be used for enforcement during consideration of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations  bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
