    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I commend an outstanding Arkansan on her birthday for her truly amazing gifts to the State of Arkansas. Mrs. Pat Seamans Walker, a Springdale resident, has always been a leader in Arkansas philanthropy by providing donations for many worthwhile causes, especially healthcare, education and human service organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Walker and her late husband Willard founded the Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation in 1986. Since that time, their generosity has touched the lives of thousands of Arkansans. Mrs. Walker is a member of the Foundation Board for the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, and an active member of First Christian Church of Springdale. She also participates in the oversight of the Walker Charitable Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pat Walker has received many awards in recognition of her philanthropy, including the 2002 American Heart Association Tiffany Award, the Distinguished Services Award from the Razorback Foundation, the prestigious Arkansas Children's Award, and the University of Arkansas Medical School Distinguished Services Award. She has been recognized as one of the Most Distinguished Women in Arkansas and was named to the Top 100 Women in Arkansas list by Arkansas Business in 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation has made countless donations over the years, including millions to educational institutions in Arkansas, millions to healthcare research and community health centers in Arkansas, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars to build libraries in Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to personally thank Mrs. Walker and the members of the Walker family for their unwavering support of the State of Arkansas. It is an honor to stand here before you today and wish such a remarkable person a happy birthday.</paragraph>
