  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am speaking in support of legislation Senator Menendez and I have introduced today. It is the Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008, to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to deliver timely and effective medical and mental health care to the individuals in custody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past week alone, the Washington Post, "60 Minutes," and the New York Times have documented the shameful state of medical care in these detention facilities. These are people who come to the United States from all corners of the world. Some come to join their families; others come to search for jobs; others come as refugees. Some may be eligible to remain in the United States. Others may be subject to deportation. But at a minimum, they deserve basic medical care while in detention pending  the outcome of their immigration proceedings, which often can take years. None of them deserves a death sentence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has an obligation to act. The bill's introduction is an important first step, and the legislation raises the medical standards and restores accountability for meeting those standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working closely with Senator Menendez and others in the Senate to address what is really a national disgrace.</paragraph>
