  <narrative>
    <bill type="h" number="1714">H.R. 1714</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF CERTAIN COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES SYSTEM MAPS.</narrative>
  <narrative> (a) In General.--The map subtitled "FL-64P", relating to the Coastal Barrier Resources System unit designated as Coastal Barrier Resources System Clam Pass Unit FL-64P, that is included in the set of maps entitled "Coastal Barrier Resources System" and referred to in section 4(a) of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(a)), is hereby replaced by another map relating to that unit entitled "Coastal Barrier Resources System Clam Pass Unit, FL-64P" and dated July 21,  2005&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Availability.--The Secretary of the Interior shall keep the map referred to in subsection (a) on file and available for inspection in accordance with section 4(b) of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(b)).&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1714">H.R. 1714</bill> is noncontroversial legislation that would replace the Coastal Barrier Resources System map designated as Clam Pass Unit FL-64P to correct legitimate inaccuracies. This legislation is identical to noncontroversial legislation reported by the Committee on Resources during the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new map, dated July 21, 2005, that would be adopted by passage of this legislation, would remove approximately 48 acres of private land from the otherwise protected area, or the  OPA, that was established in 1990 to include the Clam Pass Conservation Area. Private land owners indicated that these lands were never held within the conservation area, and were erroneously included in the OPA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, after completing an exhaustive  investigation, agreed that these areas, in fact, were added in error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fully supports this technical correction legislation which will also add approximately 68 acres of undeveloped land to the OPA that were previously omitted. In addition, Mr. Speaker, the new map that would be adopted also has been certified as accurate by all local authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I ask my colleagues to support passage of this noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1714">H.R. 1714</bill>, introduced by Congressman CONNIE MACK of Florida, corrects an honest mapping mistake made in the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990. Under current law, only Congress can add or delete property from the Coastal Barrier Resources System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, 48 acres of previously held land would be removed from the system, which would allow the affected homeowners to qualify for Federal flood insurance. We would be making this change because this property is not contained within the designated Clam Pass Conservation Area, these are not inholdings, and these lands were never held for conservation or recreation purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would be providing this relief because this bill satisfies the threshold of being a legitimate mapping mistake. The Fish and Wildlife Service testified in support of this technical correction, and the new implementing map would add 65 acres of conservation land to the Coastal Barrier Resources System that was overlooked when the unit was originally created. As a result, the net effect of <bill type="h" number="1714">H.R. 1714</bill> is to actually increase the size of the system by 17 acres.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge an "aye" vote on <bill type="h" number="1714">H.R. 1714</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this legislation. Again, I want to thank my colleague from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) for supporting this noncontroversial piece of legislation, and I urge Members to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="1714">H.R. 1714</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
