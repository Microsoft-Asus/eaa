  <narrative>IN HONOR OF DR. JERRY BEASLEY -- (Senate - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4102">S4102</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we all know that college can be a wonderful, eventful, and sometimes overwhelming time in the life of a young person. With new doors opening and a plethora of choices ahead, the years that young people devote to their college education shape the person they grow to be. We should all hope that when our loved ones set out on this journey that they encounter role models and mentors like Dr. Jerry Beasley. He has steered Concord University since 1985, in which time  he has had an immeasurable impact on the institution and its students. In the time I have been allotted, I cannot do justice to the great service Dr. Beasley has dedicated to Concord University, but through the examples I can provide I hope to at least honor these selected accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the beginning of his career at Concord, Dr. Beasley has embodied the university's mission of learning and service. Traditionally, university presidents hold elegant ceremonies and inauguration parties in order to celebrate themselves and their achievements before beginning work. Dr. Beasley is not one of these presidents. He preferred to donate the funds usually allocated for such ceremonies to the support of student scholarships, setting a precedent of selflessness he continued throughout  his tenure. He taught his students that giving and service were the foundation of citizenship, and renewing Concord's commitment to social responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of you know, access to technology is an issue of particular importance to me. I have committed myself to the enhancement of technology resources for students in West Virginia, a commitment which Dr. Beasley and I share. During his tenure as president and thanks, in part, to his oversight, the $13.9 million Rahall Technology Center is now complete and open for student use. Its 24-hour facilities provide students with access to technology ranging from high-speed internet to computer science  courses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our society today is becoming increasingly dependent on technology. As we become integrated into a global marketplace, the values of knowledge and service have become even more important. The expansion of our resources and influence demands that we all develop a greater understanding of the world we live in and the people we share it with. Under Dr. Beasley's leadership, Concord University has met these challenges headon. The student body has grown significantly reaching an all-time peak enrollment  of 3,055 students in the fall of 2001. The student body has also become incredibly diverse, with representatives from 27 States, 22 countries, and the District of Columbia. The diversity of faces and backgrounds at Concord is also complemented by a diverse range of study abroad opportunities, with scholarships available for study in Europe, South America, and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Beasley not only enhanced the diversity of the Concord student body, but also broadened the resources available on campus. Since the early 1930s, a goal of an interfaith chapel has been kept alive on the Concord campus, but, for many years, the project was left unfinished. Dr. Beasley has shepherded the project, which is now nearing completion. The building will mark not only the campus's concern for multicultural understanding, but also of Dr. Beasley's ambition to this end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Concord University students can now enjoy a wealth of opportunities without fearing the exorbitant financial burdens of education. Financial aid and scholarships are now more available than ever with more than 90 percent of Concord's students receiving some form of educational assistance. Dr. Beasley was instrumental in the effort to bring programs such as the Bonner Scholars program to campus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I admire the most about Dr. Beasley, though, is his personal commitment to public service, and the inspirational example he has set for his children, his students, and all of us. He has dedicated his career to improving education, and for that we owe him our sincerest thanks. Dr. Beasley, I am very grateful for your contributions to Concord University, and I wish you well in a peaceful retirement.</paragraph>
