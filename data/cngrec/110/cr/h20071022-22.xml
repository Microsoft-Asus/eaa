  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there's no doubt that Dwight Eisenhower played a significant role in American history. His service as a military leader, both during war and in peacetime, as our Nation's 34th President and as a statesman and a scholar are deserving of a memorial here in our Nation's capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plans to establish such a memorial, a site across the street from the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, are well underway. The commission established to oversee the memorial is now developing a design concept. Once the design is approved, the commission will oversee construction of the memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2094">H.R. 2094</bill>, sponsored by our colleague from Kansas, Representative DENNIS MOORE, makes technical changes to the staff organization and administrative authority of the commission. These changes are necessary as the commission transitions from the planning phase to the construction phase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Moore has worked very hard in this very difficult process to help get this memorial established. Thanks to his efforts, and those of the commission, future visitors to Washington will come away with a better understanding of President Eisenhower's place in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe the bill has been properly explained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to add a personal touch as a Member of Congress from Texas. We are proud that a Texan like Dwight Eisenhower is being honored. Not many people are aware, since he grew up in Kansas, that he was born in Denison, Texas, but there was so much about this great man to be admired. It is a wonderful tribute, and of course, as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee has indicated, this is not the beginning of the process. This is continuing the ongoing process to make this a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are very pleased that it's occurring. Of course, from a personal standpoint, I like the fact that he was a Republican and especially liked his hairline, but especially what he did for this Nation and shoring us up, protecting us in World War II, guiding this Nation as its President. This is a wonderful tribute, and I appreciate the work of the chairman in bringing this about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me indicate at this time that Representative Moore, the sponsor of the legislation, is in his district and will have a statement to submit for the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400282" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that I sponsored with Representatives JERRY MORAN, TODD TIAHRT, NANCY BOYDA, LEONARD BOSWELL, and MAC THORNBERRY. As an Executive Committee member of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, I know that this legislation is important to our continuing efforts to establish a national, permanent memorial to President Eisenhower. <bill type="h" number="2094">H.R. 2094</bill> would make important amendments to the statute establishing the Eisenhower  Memorial Commission, so that it can more effectively discharge its duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress created the Eisenhower Memorial Commission in 1999 and charged the Commission with establishing a national memorial to Dwight David Eisenhower to honor his memory and commemorate his contributions to the Nation. The Commission is completely bipartisan, consisting of four Senators, four Representatives, and four private citizens. The Commission keeps an office in Washington, D.C., with four full-time staff, including an Executive Director and Executive Architect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since determining a preferred site in June 2005, the Commission has worked tirelessly to speed the progress of the memorialization. In September 2006, only fifteen months later, the Commission received final site approval from the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. The National Eisenhower Memorial will be located across the street from the National Air and Space Museum at the intersection of Maryland and Independence Avenues, SW. The site is surrounded by institutions  Ike either created or  profoundly influenced, including the Department of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commission is now engaged in Pre-Design Programming, a concerted effort to determine what the memorial should be. Eisenhower family members, Eisenhower contemporaries, historians, Kansans, and many others have been interviewed on their vision for the memorial. A voluntary online questionnaire is available to the public. Although there are many diverse opinions on Ike's greatest achievement and the appropriate focus for his memorial, all agree that Eisenhower is, as Michael Korda presents  in his new biography, "an American hero."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly proud to claim one of the greatest 20th-century Americans as a fellow Kansan. He ranks as one of the preeminent figures in the global history of the 20th century. Dwight Eisenhower spent his entire life in public service. His most well-known contributions include serving as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces in World War II and as 34th President of the United States, but Eisenhower also served as the first commander of NATO and as President of Columbia University.  Dramatic changes occurred in America during his lifetime, many of which he participated in and influenced through his extraordinary leadership as President. Although Ike grew up before automobiles existed, he created the Interstate Highway System and took America into space. He created NASA, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Federal Aviation Administration. He added Hawaii and Alaska to the United States and ended the Korean War. President Eisenhower desegregated the District of Columbia</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The development of the Pre-Design Program will produce three books to serve as an information packet for potential designers and the eventual design team for the memorial. The reasons for building a memorial to Eisenhower are only one part of the challenge set out in the Pre-Design Program. Technical considerations and guidance from the National Park Service are also included. Issues from preserving the historic view to the U.S. Capitol to providing a National Park Service Ranger station at the  site are presented. This stage is the last major step prior to procuring a design team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Eisenhower Memorial Commission has so far been able to efficiently manage the memorialization process, the tasks involved in design and construction require revised administrative and operational authority. <bill type="h" number="2094">H.R. 2094</bill> provides the needed revisions and will enable the Commission to work more efficiently and effectively during design and construction when quick turnaround times are vital and daily decisions must be made. The authority provided in this legislation is based on the authority  given to temporary commissions in existence for up to three years. The Eisenhower Memorial Commission has similar needs, but exists for no set time period. The Commission will exist until the completion of the memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, <bill type="h" number="2094">H.R. 2094</bill> will enable the Commission to hire temporary federal employees instead of contract consultants, simplifying administration of staffing and covering the liability of its employees. <bill type="h" number="2094">H.R. 2094</bill> will also provide for the Executive Architect to represent the Commission on the panels that will select the design team for the memorial. As currently written, the Commission's legislation prohibits its staff or members from participating in the determination of the design team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2094">H.R. 2094</bill> will enable the Commission to continue working not only to ensure that the National Eisenhower Memorial is an inspiration to future generations, but also to ensure that the memorialization process is an example of responsible public work. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this measure today and I thank the leadership of the House Natural Resources Committee and of the House, as a whole, for bringing this bill before us today.</paragraph>
