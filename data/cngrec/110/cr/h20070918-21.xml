    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, through a hailstorm of political attacks that continue on the floor of the Congress this morning, last week, America's two lead men in Iraq brought news to this Congress which should be welcome to every American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the lack of political progress at the national level in Iraq, the military surge is working. And because the surge is working, our troops can start coming home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge every American to tune out the rhetoric in Washington, D.C. and read the report. But don't just read the testimony of General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker; read the recent report issued by the more liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. In each case, our men and that liberal think tank found civilian deaths are down. Sunni leaders are cooperating with U.S. forces, and al Qaeda is on the run in Baghdad and Anbar province. These independent assessments should be read by every  American, and every American should be encouraged; for even to a war-weary Nation, I say, if we do not grow weary in doing well, freedom will prevail in Iraq.</paragraph>
