SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Eurasia Foundation Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) There has been established in the District of Columbia a private, nonprofit corporation known as the Eurasia Foundation (hereafter in this Act referred to as the "Foundation"), which is not an agency or establishment of the United States Government.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) In recognition of the valuable contributions of the Foundation to long-range United States foreign policy interests, the United States Government has, through the United States Agency for International Development and the Department of State, provided financial support for the Foundation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) It is in the interest of the United States, and the further strengthening of cooperation with the countries of Eurasia, to establish a more permanent mechanism for United States Government financial support for the ongoing activities of the Foundation, while preserving the independent character of the Foundation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the Foundation are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) to promote civil society, private enterprise, and sound public administration and policy in the countries of Eurasia and in lending encouragement and assistance to citizens of such countries in their own efforts to develop more open, just, and democratic societies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) to strengthen indigenous institutions that foster national development, constructive social change, equitable economic growth, and cooperative international relationships that are fully consistent with and supportive of long-term United States interests with respect to the countries of Eurasia; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to conduct programs in response to initiatives in the countries of Eurasia that would be difficult or impossible for an official United States entity, and, as a result of its position in the countries of Eurasia, to respond quickly and flexibly to meet new opportunities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. GRANTS TO THE FOUNDATION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Grants Required.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) IN GENERAL.--The Secretary of State shall make an annual grant to the Foundation to enable the Foundation to carry out its purposes as specified in section 2(b).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.--Each grant required under paragraph (1)--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) shall be made with funds specifically appropriated for grants to the Foundation; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) shall be made pursuant to a grant agreement between the Secretary and the Foundation which--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) requires that grant funds will only be used for activities the Board of Directors of the Foundation determines are consistent with the purposes described in section 2(b), and that the Foundation will otherwise comply with the requirements of this Act; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) may not require the Foundation to comply with requirements other than those specified in this Act.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Use of Funds.--The Foundation may use funds received under a grant described in subsection (a) to carry out the purposes described in section 2(b).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to make the Foundation an agency or establishment of the United States Government or to make the members of the Board of Directors of the Foundation, or the officers or employees of the Foundation, officers or employees of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) Oversight.--The Foundation and its grantees shall be subject to the appropriate oversight procedures of Congress.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (e) Other Funding.--The Foundation shall have authority to accept funding from non-United States Government sources to complement United States Government funding.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (f) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) a robust Foundation, funded at the levels authorized under section 6 of this Act, and at appropriate levels in subsequent fiscal years, can contribute significantly to the political, economic, and social development of democracy and human rights in the countries of Eurasia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) notwithstanding the Foundation's distinguished record of performance, organizations that seek competitive grants typically perform in a more transparent and effective manner; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) to the maximum extent possible, the Foundation should seek competitive grants to supplement appropriations from the United States Government, and at least 20 percent of the funding received in each fiscal year by the Foundation should be from non-United States Government sources to ensure continued strong performance of the Foundation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4.

  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first thank my good friend and colleague, the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, Mr. Wexler from Florida, for introducing this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Eurasia Foundation has been a key U.S. government partner in the ongoing effort to promote democracy, expand economic opportunities, and facilitate government reform in countries that formerly comprised the Soviet Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Created in 1992 with bipartisan support, the Eurasia Foundation has invested over $360 million in Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia in programs that have complemented United States goals for participatory government and active citizenry in this region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Eurasia Foundation has been able to leverage significant private sector funding, in main part due to the annual funding support from the U.S. Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill seeks to enhance those efforts by recognizing the Eurasia Foundation as a distinct and independent entity that could continue to raise private capital while under a U.S. Government authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vital work remains unfinished in this part of the world. It is clear that political and economic stability in Eurasia will have a direct impact on the security of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, it's imperative that we continue to support programs such as those conducted by the Eurasia Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Eurasia Foundation has reportedly done some good work over the past few years of the region of the former Soviet Union. Because the aid programs for the countries of that region from which the foundation has received its funding are now closing down, the issue before us is whether that foundation should be authorized to continue to receive funds directly from the U.S. in order to continue its democracy promotion work independently. I suspect that for many of us in this House the answer would  be yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as we have had an Asia foundation, it is possible to see the work of funding this kind of foundation to do democracy promotion in Eurasia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The passage of this bill, <bill type="h" number="2949">H.R. 2949</bill>, would help ensure that funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the request of Members from our side of the aisle and the Foreign Affairs Committee, this bill has been amended in committee to try to address a significant problem that is not directly related to the Eurasia Foundation but that is an issue of importance to the wise use of our United States Government funds if they are appropriated to the foundation under this bill in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Independent of the Eurasia Foundation, our United States Government-funded Enterprise Fund in Russia, the major state of that region, is closing down and is seeking to use the hundreds of millions of dollars from the  sale of its assets to fund democracy promotion, civil society and rule-of-law programs in Russia, as well as economic reform efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we have democracy promotion programs under way across Russia and the rest of the region, through the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there is obviously a possibility that duplications of efforts will take place unless this Congress finds ways to ensure that it doesn't. We don't want to see U.S. Government-funded organizations compete to do the same kinds of activities if that leads to duplication and waste, and the democracy promotion in that region is too important to see money wasted at a time when Russian President Putin and others are forcing their own brand of authoritarian government on their nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure has been amended in a way that seeks to mandate that any successor to the U.S. Government-funded Enterprise Fund in Russia has to reach an agreement with the Eurasia Foundation before it engages in any democracy promotion efforts in that country. Hopefully, that will eliminate duplication to some degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as amended, does not go as far as some of us would like, I must note. It does not address the similar situation that will arise in the Ukraine in the next few years when our U.S. Government-funded Enterprise Fund there closes down and seeks to set up its own successor foundation that may, once again, end up duplicating the work done by the Eurasia Foundation in the Ukraine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also does not address a completely separate question about how the assets of such U.S. Government-funded Enterprise Funds in Russia and Ukraine will be disposed of, an issue that involves hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer funds. It has been the practice to ensure that the taxpayers get back at least 50 percent of the funds held by such funds when they close down their operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an effort in the House-passed fiscal year 2008 foreign aid appropriations bill, however, to allow our fund in Russia not to turn back to our Treasury half of its assets. That would mean that the taxpayers would lose $160 million, or perhaps even more than that, depending on the value of the assets sold in the case of the Russia fund alone. Those are monies that might otherwise go to help fund other worthwhile programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps this is not the bill in which to debate that issue, and our efforts in committee to address it in this measure were unsuccessful. But I take this opportunity to point out that issue in the hopes that the administration will be supported by Congress in its efforts to follow current practice and ensure that our Treasury gets back that very significant sum of money.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400430" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2949">H.R. 2949</bill>, authorizing 15 million dollars in appropriations to the Eurasia Foundation for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009. This legislation will enable the Eurasia Foundation--which has been operating in the former Soviet Union since 1992--to continue to engage at the highest level in democracy building, civil society promotion and private sector expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank Chairman LANTOS and Ranking Member ROS-LEHTINEN for their support of this legislation, as well as Congressman GALLEGLY who was the lead sponsor of this legislation in the 109th Congress. All of these Members have been tireless advocates for providing critical aid and support to former Soviet countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation comes at a critical time in our relations with Eurasian states that are still in political, economic and social transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is also coming at a time when U.S. aid to the region is unconscionably shrinking. To this end, organizations such as the Eurasia Foundation are critical components of our strategy to remain engaged at governmental and non-governmental levels in a region that stretches from Armenia to Uzbekistan and  from Ukraine to Kazakhstan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation recognizes the important work being done by the Eurasia Foundation and its efforts to promote civil society, public administration and rule of law--in a region of the world that needs America's attention, assistance and support. Passage of <bill type="h" number="2949">H.R. 2949</bill> today will provide the Eurasia Foundation--a partner of the U.S.--the funds it needs to continue to issue thousands of grants and operate programs in Eurasia that have proven to be effective over fourteen years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member ROS-LEHTINEN for supporting this important legislation and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation when it comes to the floor for a vote.</paragraph>
