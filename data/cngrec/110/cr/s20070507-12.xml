    <paragraph>I note that the Senator from Maine was on the floor before I came down, and I know there are other Senators, Senator Roberts being one, who wanted to speak, and I think Senator Burr. We also have a number on our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My ranking member is here, and I imagine he will allocate the time on his side. I am glad to have the good Senator from Maine go ahead. I understand there are 9 minutes in total on her side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow her.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
