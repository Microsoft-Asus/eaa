    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak in honor and pay tribute to a fallen paramedic from my State, Palm Beach County Fire-Rescue Lieutenant Rafael Vazquez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rafael's life ended prematurely this week; he died at the very young age of 42. But the memory of his dedication, hard work, and commitment to public service will live on for many lifetimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rafael Vazquez led a life committed to public service. For the past 7 years, he worked at Station 28 in Royal Palm Beach, and this January he was promoted to the rank of rescue lieutenant. The men and women he supervised speak about him with great pride--describing him as a hard worker, a man with a sense of humor, and a loving father. This was a man whom they respected and considered a friend; they simply called him "Ray."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rafael's coworkers knew him as someone who loved his Puerto Rican heritage. He often cooked Latin food for his colleagues. And even though he was born in Brooklyn, NY, after Rafael moved to Florida, as is our tradition in the Sunshine State, he immediately became a Floridian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rafael was also a family man--a devoted father and husband. He met his wife Michele while working at American Medical Response and cared for her deeply. In a recent news account, Rafael's wife Michele remembered her husband as, "..... a jokester with a quick wit and an infectious smile who would help anyone in need." Michele added, "I thank God every day for giving me the 13 years that I had with him." The couple had a young son together and four children from previous relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Floridians receive rapid medical care in times of emergency because of people like Rafael Vazquez. He loved his work and his contribution will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of Florida and the people of the United States, I thank and honor rescue lieutenant Rafael Vazquez for his service to his community and the safety he helped to promote.</paragraph>
