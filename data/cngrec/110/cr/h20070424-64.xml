    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 96th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 24, 1915, 300 Armenian leaders were rounded up and deported and killed under the orders from the young Turk Government. And so began the genocide that lasted for 7 years, resulting in an estimated over 1.5 million Armenian deaths. To this day, unfortunately, the Turkish Government denies that this occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House, I just returned from Darfur with a group of our colleagues 2 weeks ago. Over 450,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in Darfur; yet government officials claim there in Darfur and Sudan that there is no genocide, that the situation is overblown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday Rwanda, today Darfur. And we can remember the Holocaust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, silence is genocide's best ally. It is time that the Congress end this silence and pass the Armenian genocide resolution. The message will be clear: the United States of America will never forget and never stand for those who support genocide.</paragraph>
