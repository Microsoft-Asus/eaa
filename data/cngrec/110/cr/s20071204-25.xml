  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14735">S14735</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="SERGEANT KENNETH R. BOOKER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Vevay, IN. SGT Kenneth Raymond Booker, 25 years old, died November 14th in Mukhisa, Iraq. Sergeant Booker died of injuries he sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an optimistic future before him, Kenneth risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="14736">S14736</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kenneth graduated in 2000 from Switzerland County High School in southeastern Indiana. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Army, happy at the prospect of serving his country. As a member of the 82nd Airborne division from Fort Bragg, NC, Kenneth served in Afghanistan and Iraq. His exemplary service earned him an assignment in military intelligence at Fort Lewis, WA. Kenneth, however, preferred working in the field to an office and requested to transfer back to infantry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joining a Stryker Brigade Combat Unit at Fort Lewis, Kenneth returned to Iraq for his third deployment. Kenneth was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division. He will be remembered by his friends and family for his clever sense of humor, his love of hunting and target shooting, his outgoing nature, and above all, his outstanding dedication to his country. Kenneth is survived by his father, SSG Charles Booker; his mother, Becky  Graham; and his brother, Kaleb Daniel Booker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Kenneth's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Kenneth. Today and always, Kenneth will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring Kenneth's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: "We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here." This statement is  just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Kenneth's actions will live on far longer than any record of these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of SGT Kenneth Raymond Booker in the official Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Kenneth's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will  wipe away tears from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Kenneth.</paragraph>
