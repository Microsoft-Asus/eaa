    <paragraph>Last week, President George W. Bush outlined a new strategy and new tactics in our war in Iraq; he called it, "The Way Forward." Sadly, many in Congress and many around the country want to go backwards; to redeploy, to undo our military commitment to freedom in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I understand this temptation, even though I disagree with it. It is always tempting to go backwards, always tempting to want to go back before loss and hardship and war. The Old Book tells us otherwise, reading, "Forgetting what is behind, I press on."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winston Churchill gave us this counsel: "One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it; if you do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will reduce the danger by half." So said Winston Churchill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support our Commander in Chief. I support our new way forward. We must come together as a Nation. We must decide as a Nation not to see freedom fail in Iraq.</paragraph>
