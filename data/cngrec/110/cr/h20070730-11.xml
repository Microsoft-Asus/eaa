    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hope for Vision was founded to assist individuals dealing with the loss of vision and to raise much-needed funding for scientific research on retinal degenerative and other blinding diseases so that future generations will not have to cope with this tragic issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Carlos and Betty Lidsky, leaders in Hope for Vision, for many years, and their son Isaac, an attorney here in Washington, serves as the Chairman and President of Hope for Vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 12, Isaac was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a retinal degenerative disorder. However, this did not slow Isaac down. He attended New Walls School of the Arts in Miami before receiving his bachelor's and his law degree from Harvard University. While at Harvard, he met Dorothy, who has become a passionate advocate for the vision impaired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Saturday, September 8, this organization will hold an event in south Florida to ensure that this horrible condition receives the proper attention and research needed to find a cure. Their tenacity and courage in the face of such adversity and heartbreak is commendable. Inspired by their dedication and hard work, we are working towards a cure.</paragraph>
