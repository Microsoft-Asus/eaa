    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are working with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and the leadership on both sides to get an agreement worked out on how we proceed on this issue for the remainder of the afternoon. In the meantime, Senator DeMint is here and ready to go on an amendment, and he has a committee markup underway also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So unless there is objection, I ask Senator Lautenberg, could we let Senator DeMint call up his amendment and go ahead and have a discussion on it?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to discuss amendment No. 3467. Before I discuss the amendment specifically, I would like to talk a little bit about rail passenger service in America and Amtrak specifically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one of the best infrastructure visions we could have as a country today would be to create high-speed passenger rail service that moves people economically and efficiently around the country. The irony is, as long as we continue to pour our Federal resources into the Amtrak model, we will never get to that vision of an efficient passenger rail service in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear from years of working with Amtrak and the model of using freight rails and Government subsidies to support an Amtrak system, we will never have a world-class passenger rail service through the Amtrak model. So I hope we as a Congress, as a Senate, particularly, can come to terms with the fact that if we continue to throw money at Amtrak, we will never have efficient passenger rail service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, there are a couple of lines of rail service of Amtrak, particularly in the Northeast, that work well for a number of people. But the fact is, many Americans are contributing to the few passengers who are using Amtrak today. Taxpayers all over the country are putting their money into these few lines that work, even though very few Americans actually ever use these rail services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we discuss this final bill, it is important we remember that in the last year the Federal Government gave Amtrak $1.3 billion in subsidies, even though they carry less than 1 percent of the Nation's intercity passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak is the most heavily subsidized mode of transportation in the country. In fact, every ticket people purchase from Amtrak has an average subsidy of over $210 per passenger per 1,000 miles traveled. We even have some lines where the subsidy reaches as high as $500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment does not change this. But it tells America the truth about the subsidies for each of these tickets people buy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment requires Amtrak to put on every ticket for the line they  are using the amount of subsidy the taxpayers are putting into the cost of each of these tickets. By doing this, we will force Amtrak to do what all businesses have to do, which is to track the real cost of every product they sell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, it is very difficult to determine actually how much Amtrak spends on each of its lines of service. But by requiring they put the cost of the subsidy on every ticket, they will have to calculate the cost--which is the revenue and the losses--for each line in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every business should have to do it. Amtrak should as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the only way we can get a handle on actually how much we are spending for each line and hopefully determining, after a while, which lines make sense to continue and which lines should be eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It does not do anything to reduce funding for Amtrak or put any additional restrictions on them. But it does require them to show America what the real subsidy is for every ticket they sell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to you, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the remainder of my time and look forward to your comments. Hopefully, we will have your support on this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have had a number of conversations over the last 24 hours with the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, with the Democratic leader, Steny Hoyer, Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, and others who have indicated on the CHIP matter they need more time, they have had conversations with Republican House Members who voted not to override the President's veto, they are having conversations with people within the administration, trying to come up with  something on CHIP, and they need more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My first inclination, after having heard this, was, well, we have waited long enough. But after having spoken to these Senators--Senator Hatch, especially, has been working hard. They have already had meetings with Republican House Members. Senator Baucus, I have spoken to him at great length, and he is also having meetings with some of the Republicans in the House to see if there is something that can be worked out. I do not know if there can be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we have done with the matter that will shortly be before the Senate: As to childless adults who are in the program now, under the original bill we passed, they would be phased out in 2 years. In the bill that is now before this body--or shortly will be--they are phased out over 1 year. So we cut that in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ninety-two percent of the people drawing benefits--and the "people" are little people, are children drawing benefits from this program--92 percent of them are in families not exceeding 200 percent of poverty. And 200 percent of poverty is about $40,000 a year for a family of four. We have only one State above 300 percent of poverty, and there are maybe five or six States from 200 percent to 300 percent of poverty. So we have said there will be no waivers above 300 percent of poverty. We have  changed along that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have tightened down the language as it relates to illegal children drawing benefits. Under the original bill we passed, illegal children could not get the benefits. You had to be in the country for at least 5 years, with proper papers, and then you could, after having been here 5 years. So we have tightened everything down. We have changed that, hopefully, to pick up some more votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this stage, Senator Hatch and others have said to me: We need a little more time. We would like--because Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley were in on the changes we made. They were not done by Democrats. For every meeting held, they were in on the meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they said give us some more time and maybe we can come up with something else. I am willing to do that. We are willing to do that. I would hope the Republicans mean that, that they do need more time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what I would be willing to do--and when I say "I," it is not me--but what we would be willing to do is to put the vote off on CHIP until we finish the farm bill. I am going to do the farm bill next week. I am not going to go to it this week. We would go ahead and finish Amtrak and then move to something else. What it is, I don't know. I will try to come up with something that would be without a lot of pain to anyone. There are many things we have to do that are bipartisan in nature that  I think we could go to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had originally considered offering a unanimous consent request where we would move off CHIP and go to it when we finish the transportation bill, and in exchange for that, give me permission to go to something else. I have withdrawn that. I don't want any excuses. I don't want anyone saying: Look, we would have done that, but he was demanding what we go to next, and I am not going to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am going to recite into the Record a unanimous consent request which will say basically that we will move off CHIP, giving Senator Hatch and others time to negotiate to see if they can come up with something that is agreeable to the body, and maybe we can do CHIP so that--and the only requirement I think that Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, I, the Speaker, Congressman Rangel, and Congressman Dingell have is that  we cover the same amount of kids. We tried to do that in some fashion. Right now, if we don't do something, the number of children covered will drop from 5.5 million to 4.5 million. That is the way it is. Those are the facts, and we can't change that. If we passed our bill, the one that got 69 votes in this body, instead of having 5.5 million, we would have 10 million children who would be covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we can do that. But anyway, without belaboring the point, what I am going to ask permission to do is that we move off CHIP at what time it would occur naturally and take it up when we finish the farm bill. The rest of this week we will be working on something else. What that will be, I will certainly consult with the Republican leader. But right now, whatever I do, unless I get consent from the Senate--not only the Republicans but the Senate--I would have to get consent to do that or  otherwise I would have to file cloture on a motion to proceed to it. So there are no surprises in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be vitiated with respect to the motion to proceed to the CHIP bill, <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, and the Senate begin consideration of that bill following the disposition of the farm bill, <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have indicated, we are not going to move right to the farm bill. We are going to wait until at least Monday to get to the farm bill, as I have indicated.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I may do that, and address some comments to the distinguished majority leader, and maybe even some questions, first of all, I think we have made good progress on the Amtrak bill. The leader was considerate of allowing it to go over until today, and our colleagues have fulfilled their commitments to be reasonable with their amendments, and we believe we are ready to go to Senator DeMint's amendment and get a vote on it at a certain  time. I believe we could be very close to going to passage also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to vitiating the cloture motion on the Children's Health Insurance Program, I can't see any reason why we would object to that, but we ought to continue to try to find a solution. Unfortunately, there has been no real consultation with the leadership on this side of the aisle by those who have been having all of these meetings, and we still have not involved the administration in trying to get a solution that we believe we could all get broad agreement on and avoid going back and  forth on bills and vetoes. But to take more time--we still hope you will come up with something that will be supported broadly and signed by the President. But the idea that we would then agree for this to go automatically to the farm bill, we would have to have--</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>I am not asking unanimous consent for the farm bill; I am just going to go to the farm bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>But SCHIP would come back automatically after the farm bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>After we finish that, yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>After a discussion with our leadership, at this time we would have to object. We don't object to vitiating the cloture vote on the CHIP bill,  but we want to make sure we understand we are not agreeing to automatically going to the CHIP bill after the farm bill. So based on that, I would object at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is hard for me to comprehend the logic of the objection. We are not asking unanimous consent from anybody as to what we are going to go to next. If the minority wants to object to going to the farm bill, they have the right to do that. I think it would be unusual for them to do that, but they have a right to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We filed our 50th cloture motion, and it was my favorite. It was my favorite because it was bipartisan. It was the first bipartisan cloture motion we filed all year. It was on Amtrak. If we have to file cloture on the farm bill, that is fine. It would just take us a couple of extra days to get to the substance of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would also say it would seem to me that if the Republicans are sincere in wanting to do a CHIP bill, unless I am missing something, what better opportunity would they have? I have said let's get off this bill. As we all know, to finish the farm bill could take a little bit of time. I would hope we could finish it in a week, but as we know, in that week it could be interspersed with an appropriations conference report. We have to do the CR. So I can't imagine our finishing the farm bill  very quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I was told initially on this CHIP matter that they needed 2 days to try to work something out. They are going to have well more than 2 days. It is not as if the Republicans have been in the dark. Remember, the two advocates for this--we would not have had a CHIP bill but for Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch. They were part of everything that took place in this bill. When the bill was not overridden--when the veto was not overridden and the bill was rewritten in the House,  it wasn't rewritten by the House; it was rewritten by the House and Senator Grassley's staff and Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were in on every word put in this new bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as the administration, it would seem to me if they have a couple of weeks, then that is what this will basically give them, 10 days to 2 weeks. That gives them lots of time to work with the administration, Secretary Leavitt, or whoever they want to deal with it. Leader Pelosi and I asked the President the day he vetoed this bill--because he kept saying: I want to meet with the leadership. Speaker Pelosi asked him in the morning; I asked him in the afternoon. He said:  I am not going to meet with you. So we have tried. We want to be reasonable. This is an important bill. It deals with children. It is bipartisan. This is not a Democratic bill. It is a Democratic and Republican bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have heard the objection. I understand English. I would hope, though, that this afternoon my friends would reassess this; otherwise, we will go ahead and vote, as we have, on a motion to proceed to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me it would be a little difficult, as fair as we have tried to be, for people to change their votes on it. But miracles never cease, and the Republicans, I am sorry to say, have been pulled in as puppets in the past during the almost 7 years this man has been President, and maybe they can do it again. I would hope not on an issue this important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat, we simply want to have the Republicans get what they want. Can't they take yes for an answer? We have said, you want more time? This isn't an idea I came up with. The Republicans came to me and said they needed more time. Senator Hatch called me last night. I talked to him twice last night. I talked to Senator Grassley yesterday; and Senator Baucus, I called him and said: Is that OK with you? He said: Yes, that is OK with me. So I don't know how we could be  more reasonable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens if they don't do this? We are going to go ahead and vote on the motion to proceed and vote cloture on the bill. If that is what they want, that is what we can do. But I don't know how, when somebody says will you do this for me, and we say yes, they say no.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Republican whip is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with regard to Senator Reid's comments, I don't see any problem with vitiating cloture on the so-called CHIP bill, <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>. If the leader would like to do that, I assume after consultation with Leader McConnell there wouldn't be any problem getting it done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, say that after the farm bill you would automatically go to the CHIP bill which would preclude debate time on the motion to proceed, if necessary. To put that after the farm bill without full rights of the minority would be a concern. First of all, we don't know when that might come. It could come 2 weeks from now, right up against a date when we are supposed to be going out for the Thanksgiving period and we don't want to short-circuit that. But if we could work out something  where our rights would be protected with regard to the CHIP bill instead of just going automatically to it after the farm bill, it looks as if that is something that could be worked out.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a deal. Again, trying to be more reasonable than I probably should be, but in an effort to try to be fair, I would consider offering a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to CHIP following the farm bill, and if cloture is voted, go directly to the bill. That way we don't lose the 30 hours. This would give people--if people felt aggrieved that they weren't treated properly during this period of time. I just don't want to lose the 30 hours because that is time  toward the end of the session, and we are desperate for time for things that need to be done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Let me say, if the Leader will yield, you are making an effort, and I think we will need some time to consult with our leader to make sure he is aware of this. I understand the leader doesn't want to have time used that is not necessary. But we have another unanimous consent agreement. We have an amendment that is pending. In the meantime, I will check with Senator McConnell and see what he is thinking.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>I would say to my friend, in fairness, I talked to Senator McConnell prior to lunch, but it wasn't in any detail. I told him generally what I was going to do. So I think it is appropriate to take a little more time, and we can all come out later and try this again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want the record to be spread, if anyone can come up with a more fair proposal than I have offered, then they should come to the Senate floor because I have basically given those people who have wanted more time--and those are the Republicans--everything they have asked for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, I also want to say not only do I appreciate the Senator's comments about moving forward on the Amtrak bill, but this is a bipartisan piece of legislation, and I was maybe being a little flippant, but I was very serious. I think it is wonderful. We had a bipartisan cloture motion filed. We need to do more of those, if possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 20 minutes for debate with respect to the DeMint amendment, No. 3467, prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that no amendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote; that the remaining pending amendments be withdrawn; that no other amendments be in order other than a managers' package of amendments that has been cleared by both managers and leaders; that upon disposition of these amendments, the bill, as amended,  be read for a third time, and at 4 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the DeMint amendment; and that upon disposition of the DeMint amendment, all postcloture time be considered yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of the bill; further, that the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill> not occur prior to 6:30 p.m., Wednesday, October 31 or at a time determined by the two leaders on Wednesday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe now we are ready to go forward with the pending DeMint amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we agreed to 20 minutes of debate on the DeMint amendment, once the Senator arrives. I believe we are sending a note to him. He had to go to a markup in the Commerce Committee. He has amendments  he wants to offer. He will be back momentarily to offer those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the meantime, I want to respond to some of the things the majority leader was noting. I wanted to do it when he was on the floor, but it is important to try to work through these unanimous consent agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that on the effort to vitiate cloture on the motion to proceed to the Children's Health Insurance Program, it was noted that it had been requested by Republicans that 2 more days be given to work something out. I note that I don't believe that request came from the Republican leader, Senator McConnell. Members on both sides of the aisle have to recognize that our leaders are our leaders. Our leaders have to be consulted on parliamentary procedure and also on timing. So when  one Senator--Senator Hatch--says give me 2 more days but there is no contact or consultation with our leadership on this side of the aisle, that is a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, we want to make sure we don't give up our normal rights, the regular order. I am concerned about going to some other issue after the Amtrak bill and then going to the farm bill next week. They have been on the farm bill we don't know how long, and at the last minute we may call up a bipartisan agreement, but it will not resolve the agreements on SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must focus on poor children. I am concerned with the present condition of the bill. My analysis is that this bill costs more than the bill that was vetoed, and fewer children are covered. It has an express lane for illegal children to go into the program. There is a multitude of problems with it. The biggest problem is we are still talking about over $35 billion. Instead of trying to come to a compromise on the money that is necessary to cover poor children first, it is still not going to  get adults off the program. My observation has been when you let adults get on a program intended for children, you crowd children out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are huge problems in the status of the negotiations, which are going on by a group that has not included the Republican leadership or the administration. I don't know who met with whom, or why, or why not. We ought to work this out. I don't like playing games with a program such as this. I stood on this floor and spoke when this program was created. I believe in it. I thought we were going to focus on poor children and not continue to raise the income levels that were covered to 300, 350,  or 400 percent of poverty and put it into the program. We need to look at the formula. Some States, such as mine, run out of money year after year because the formula doesn't deal with the realities of the needs of the poor children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are multiple problems with what is going on. I am very concerned, on our side of the aisle, about some of the involvement of some of our people without consultation with our leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The incurable attitude around here is evidenced by this bill. You can find a way to fight and have a disagreement or you can find a way to work together. This Amtrak bill is, I believe, on the verge of passing by a wide margin. If the House is smart, they will not put poison pills in it and try to explode it. Let's get real reforms and put some pressure on Amtrak. I want a successful national rail passenger system. Do I want subsidies for individual passengers to be reduced? Yes. Do I want the  cost of meals to be subsidized by the taxpayers? No. Do I want a strongly led, effective national rail passenger system? Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's try to make that happen. But it is not going to happen instantly. We have to set up a process, require reforms, and give incentives to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things I think is going to help, which some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have referred to, is we are going to have more intercity service as a result of this bill. We have a program specifically aimed to help States set up interservice transportation between not just New York and Albany but sites all over the country where States can do more, where there is a way to get an opportunity to do more to have intercity service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have language that will start toward a situation where freight lines can bid to provide the service on these lines. We do it with a pilot program. We don't just say anybody can come in; we say one the first year, two the second year, but we will work toward seeing if others can offer this service more efficiently, effectively, and more cost responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very much concerned about how these negotiations are going on on the Children's Health Insurance Program. There is a meeting going on down the hall now that doesn't include the leadership on our side. Fifty staff people have been standing out in the hall. I have a novel idea: I think Senators ought to be involved--men and women of good faith and intellect who understand these problems. We don't have to have our staffs do this for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same is true with Amtrak. Senator Lautenberg and I have worked on this for at least 3 to 5 years. This is the third Amtrak reform I have been involved in. I apologize for the other two not doing everything we wanted them to do. We have made progress. It didn't do as well as it should have. Now we are trying again. I say to the Amtrak leadership and the Department of Transportation, first, we are giving DOT more involvement in what Amtrak does. No President has made Amtrak work the  way it should. They don't pay enough attention to it. And it is not partisan; I don't think this administration is or that the previous administration was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will help us move in the direction of a national passenger rail system. I  don't want to go into great length. I don't have to object when the leader makes a request to lock in the agreement to basically finish Amtrak this afternoon and then do something else this afternoon--we don't know what--and on Thursday and Friday and then come to the farm bill next week. Then to go automatically to a CHIP bill, which we don't know what it is going to be, and we give up our rights of regular order, that is not a good arrangement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the two leaders will get together and proceed to another bill tomorrow. I don't know what it might be. I represent a farm State. I hope we can get a good farm bill and do it in a reasonable period of time. I worry that we are not wanting to get an agreement on the Children's Health Insurance Program. Some people are saying $35 billion or bust. Others are saying we are not going to go to $35 billion. The President is at $5 billion. The earlier bill the President vetoed was at $35 billion.  Now the new bill is $35 billion. Is there not an area between the two? I have done negotiations around here for years, in the House, in the Senate, and in conference. When one side is at 5 and the other is at 35, what is half of that? It is a little over 15. Would that work? What is the solution? Is it 20? How complicated is that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we need to put the emphasis on the poor children first, quit this budget creep we always get into, adding more and more children at higher income levels, and now we have adults and other loopholes in this program that I think we need to be very careful about. Can we do it? Absolutely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced a bill a month ago that was probably in the range of where the compromise ought to be. By the way, it was about double what I thought we needed to do when we started out, but I moved up. I hope the two leaders will get an understanding of what the process is going to be and move forward on all of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are now waiting for Senator DeMint to return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will yield the floor so Senator Lautenberg may comment on the bill or on other issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to start off this discussion by saying how much I appreciate working with Senator Lott and with other Members of the Senate in terms of the amendments. They were offered and considered, but we moved with a degree of dispatch, indicating to me that this is a bill that is wanted by a significant majority of the Senate. That is representing what we believe is a significant public opinion about whether Amtrak ought to be brought up to date and be part  of the transportation system that can help relieve other transportation modes of the congestion, pollution, et cetera, that we face constantly in our country right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the amendment that has been offered by Senator DeMint is not one of those amendments we would accept--the notion that each ticket a  passenger carries should identify the amount of subsidy that goes into that passenger's ride. I think it is wasteful and I don't see any benefit to travelers or taxpayers. Can you imagine the complication that is involved here? You don't know how many passengers are going to be on that leg and the subsidy  has to be divided among the number of passengers. How far is each passenger going to travel? That would also indicate a part of the subsidy. You cannot take a mathematical formula and apply it to this percentage or to this particular passenger's ride.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know what is afoot here. I generally agree that transparency is good when it comes to Federal taxpayers' dollars. But this amendment is not needed. It carries the request that Amtrak publish subsidies on its Web site. It already publishes subsidies information per route on its Web site every month as part of its financial report--the general information related to those routes, not individual subsidies per ticket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak also provides details on every dollar and dime of its finances to the Department of Transportation and the Congress on a continuous basis. The DeMint amendment would provide travelers with redundant information and, frankly, waste Federal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated in my earlier comment, it would also be logistically almost impossible to do what this amendment calls for--to determine the subsidy for each rider and print this information on a ticket. These numbers change depending on how far a passenger rides the train. Even if they did not, Amtrak would have to redesign its online reservations and ticketing system for customers to get this information. One doesn't have to have been in the computer business, as I was, in order to know it would  take an incredible amount of time and energy to get the software up to date and get the information in on time for it to be printed with any degree of accuracy on the ticket. It is the kind of added cost and redtape that taxpayers are disdainful of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't require the same printing burdens on the airlines, and we have provided some $20 billion to that industry in the last 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans already understand our Nation's passenger rail system requires subsidies, just as rail systems in other countries. What American travelers care about is receiving high-quality and convenient rail service as a result of that subsidy, and this amendment is not going to do anything to help us in those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has indicated he and I have worked on transportation issues for many years. Finally, the public is so immersed in congestion, in lost time, in delayed and missed appointments, and with the price of gasoline going up as it is--I recently saw a prediction from someone engaged in the oil industry in the Far East that oil was going to be up to $200 a barrel in the not-too-distant future. Do we want to continue to subject the American public to these outrageous costs for this  fuel, or do we want to try to achieve some balance in our transportation systems? Trains are much more economical, reduce congestion, reduce pollution, and can establish a level of reliability we can't get out of the aviation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked about whether we might abandon food and beverage service on the rail lines. We took a vote and it was soundly defeated. But as I listened to the debate, I wondered whether next we would be debating separate charges for the oil and bearing grease that is used on the wheels of the train cars and locomotives, and maybe we can separate out further expenses, maybe paper used in hand towels and items of that nature and reduce the number of those used. We cannot deal with such small matters  if we want to get onto doing something that helps the country function more efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has truly got bipartisan support. We see it not only in the leadership that our friend the Senator from Mississippi applies so skillfully, but there were quite a number of colleagues on the Republican side who joined in to get this bill as far as it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have almost miraculously come to a consensus that says after years of working towards this goal, we are going to get to a positive conclusion toward the reauthorization of Amtrak. It doesn't mean all the problems were solved by a long shot, but it does say we want rail to be as well treated as well as our other means of transportation. We spend some $40 billion each year on our highways, and aviation, unlike Amtrak, is a for-profit business, and we are still giving subsidies to the airlines  each and every year and, as I mentioned, over $20 billion since 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we look at the possibilities of rail service and see that in Europe, for instance, from Brussels, Belgium, to Paris, France, is 200 miles, about the same distance we are from New York City, they do it in 1 hour 25 minutes. Here, if we use an airplane, we can be sure that one out of four flights is going to be late in departure and usually late on arrival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we could get Amtrak to improve its service so we can reduce the amount of time it takes--I had the good fortune this morning to take a 7 o'clock train out of New York City. I live in New Jersey, but it was convenient for me to get to the terminal in New York City. I arrived 2 1/2  hours later, city to city--New York City to Washington, DC. We didn't shake, rattle, and roll all the time. It was nice; if you wanted to have a coffee or write or read, it was reasonably comfortable to do that.  That is what rail passengers deserve all across this country--adequate service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are anxiously awaiting a vote on the next amendment, which has been ordered, and final passage on the Amtrak bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, Senator Lott, for his cooperative manner and his leadership throughout the issues we have faced in this body almost all the years I have been here. We have served together a long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I again say to Senator Lautenberg, I have enjoyed working with him on transportation issues--from aviation to highways to highway safety and certainly the rail area and most particularly with regard to Amtrak and the national rail passenger system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier today, I referred to a "Parade" article that will be printed on November 4, 2007. This is a great article. I am going to be quoting some very interesting items that are included in this article because they are so applicable to our debate:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans spent about 3.7 billion hours stuck in traffic last year, burning gasoline whose price had soared by 60 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And probably going up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the airports, security lines snake endlessly, runways are choked, and delays are common. One recent study found that between January and August 2007, one in four flights arrived late; 159 flights were kept on the tarmac for more than 3 hours in August.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard a story one time about a friend of mine, a Congressman from Missouri, who went to the airport and wanted to check three bags. He told the attendant: I would like this bag to go to St. Louis, this bag to Kansas City, and this bag to Chicago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said: You can't do that. Why would you want to do that anyway?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: Well, that is what happened to my luggage last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are certain indignities that go along with this. I don't want to attack airlines. We need to do more in aviation. We need a modern aviation control system. We should be critical when they do things that are indefensible, such as keeping people trapped on a plane on the tarmac.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to be thinking about our transportation system in the air in the next generation, how are we going to make it safe, how are we going to deal with congestion. Let's not stand here and complain; let's act on it. That is why I am supporting an FAA reauthorization bill that includes funds for modernization. Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia and I have worked together on that legislation. He has been courageous, staking a tough stand. Everybody wants modernization; nobody wants to pay for it. We have had some serious recommendations,  and I am still hopeful that we can resurrect that bill. That is another reason why we need this particular legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Trains use one-fifth less energy than cars or planes." I know this is something the Presiding Officer from Vermont cares a lot about. This makes environmental and conservation sense. They are business efficient, tourist  friendly, and that goes not only for the Senator from New Jersey who came down this very morning, but the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, who said he was in New York City and came down on the train. It cost less, it was  very pleasant, and it didn't take as much time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why shouldn't we try to do more of that? By the way, it is not just about the eastern seaboard. We want a national passenger rail system. But one of the keys, as I mentioned earlier, is intercity connections. We are not talking about just going north, but talking about an intercity connection between DC and Charlotte, NC. We are talking about Portland and Seattle, Chicago and Detroit. We are talking Miami and Jacksonville. And we provide additional assistance in this bill through the State Capital  Grant Program for intercity passenger rail projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The grant program makes grants to States or groups of States to pay for the capital cost of facilities and equipment necessary to provide new and improved intercity passenger rail. The Federal match is 80 percent. Projects are selected by the Secretary of Transportation based on economic feasibility, expected ridership, and other factors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, that is the same arrangement we have with highways. People say: Oh, my goodness, subsidy of a rail passenger system? Well, yes. We have a subsidy for airlines, and we have a subsidy for highways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish we didn't have to have a subsidy. I do hope we do a better job of running Amtrak. I think some progress has been made. I still say former Chairman of Amtrak, David Gunn is a good man and did a lot of tough things and would have done more if he had been able to stay on. I wish him well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, how much money are we subsidizing Amtrak? Last year, the funding was $1.3 billion, the same as it was 25 years ago. We haven't even accounted for a piece of the inflationary impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want modernization. I don't want the Acela, this nice train running from Washington, DC, to New York and Philadelphia and then have me have to ride some raggedy train from Meridian, MS, that bumps and grinds and drags along and eventually comes to Washington. I want to have something like the Acela, also. We are going to have to have capital improvements. We will have to modernize. We can't tell the people we want you to consider the alternative of rail passenger if it is not on time, if the  food has been pulled off the trains, and the equipment is pathetic. It is probably going to be an overnight trip. You have to have some modicum of comfort to take advantage of this alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a feeling--and it is not a good one--that we are going to have gridlock and congestion, maybe even safety threats. We are going to have to have a national passenger rail system. I would rather ride on a sleeper or a nice passenger car than in a cargo-type boxcar. That is the way a lot of people have traveled in years gone by, boxcars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are trying to do something responsible to make a difference for the American people and deal with our transportation needs in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want more transparency. I do want them to cut out the waste. If food costs are being driven by 52 percent labor cost, change it. Raise the cost, do whatever is necessary. But I am tired of people complaining about it and nobody doing anything about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Amtrak board: Get engaged. On transportation, I have urged this administration and the previous administration: Lead us, push the edge. Yet we have had to drag administrations into this area, which is one of the few areas, in my opinion, philosophically, the Federal Government has a role--interstate transportation. You can't do it alone if you are a poorer State, such as Vermont, Montana or Mississippi. It has to be between States, it has to be supported by the Federal Government.  It creates jobs. When we build a highway, when we extend a runway, when we improve a terminal and make it safer, make it where the transportation safety administration can do its job, when we lay more railroad track, when we put more trains on that trackage, when we provide good service, jobs are created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have absolutely been convinced, in the last 10 years of my career, that transportation is key to future of the country. Infrastructure, yes, industrial sites, water, all that. But lanes, planes, trains, ports, and harbors, if people can't get there, whether it is an individual, a corporate executive or international, multinational company, they are not going to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If they have to get there on a dirt road--no. They are not going to come. If they can't get decent commercial service, they are not going to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just a part of the package. It is the kind of thing we can do in a bipartisan way. One of my big problems this whole year is we have looked for ways or issues that we fight over. "We are defining our base." "We are defining our party." Baloney. I didn't come here just to define a party. I think we ought to be trying to find a way to do some things for the American people. It doesn't have to be the grand design of tax policy or budget policy. No, it can be national rail passenger system.  It can be something smaller that we can work together on that produces a real result. Let's quit looking for ways that we can fight. There will be plenty of time for that. Let's look for things we can do together that have broad support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be involved when that time comes. I am in and out of here--around here all the time, on a bipartisan basis, because I just can't stand the idea of just being here and producing nothing. I have been told, in a way, I have some sort of congenital defect; and that is a desire to get things done. I hope that is what the moniker on my tombstone will say: He died trying to get something done, something that people care about in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am getting a little carried away. I am sounding like a preacher. I apologize. But I am passionate about this. I feel a little offended. Some people are sitting here saying this guy is from Mississippi, what does he care? I care because it is right for our whole country, not just for my State. I don't have a vested interest, thank goodness. Yes, we will have a little Amtrak service, not a whole lot, but we will have a couple of lines that come blowing through my State. We will be glad to have  them. We hope they will stop a couple of times and pick us up and take us to New Orleans or take us to Atlanta or take us to Chicago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Europe and Japan and other countries have done this. I don't like to emulate those countries in a lot of instances, but if they can do it, you are telling me we can't do it? It is just a matter of us making up our minds that we are going to do this, and I hope we have made up our minds this time and we are going to do something that will really help the national passenger rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Lott was speaking about the larger assignment that we have in front of us rather than simply a party allegiance. There is no doubt that long before we were Republicans and Democrats, we were Americans. If we keep that focus in mind, I think we can help our country achieve some of the goals that we need to examine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at the conditions that have overtaken America--I will use that word--and look back at the population. In 1970--1971, when AMTRAK was taken over as a quasi-public corporation, the country had 200 million people. Now, barely 35 years later, we have 300 million in this country of ours. Imagine, 100 million more people, and we are still depending on a rail system that was largely developed far earlier than the 1970s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Senator Lott was absolutely right when he spoke about our need to bring the aviation system up to date as well. We have narrowed the separation between airplanes to one thousand feet vertically. That is not designed to scare anybody because the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) can handle it, but the FAA does say we are squeezing whatever spare air we have to fill the airspace. When we look at the lighter jets coming into service, it is expected that there will be some 5,000  new very light jets in the sky in the next 10 years. We see the planes are filled constantly and ways have to be figured out to make air service more reliable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat something that has been said many times: One out of four flights is late today. One of the airports that suffers from these delays is my favorite  airport, and that is Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. We have to learn different ways to do things because, as has been said, the air time to fly from Newark or LaGuardia--I live in between because I live in that part of New Jersey near the Washington Bridge, so I live midway in  between. So I can go to either airport for service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what has happened is I have been on the airplane many times going up from here to our region and I hear the pilot say: Good evening, the weather is fine, the flying time to Newark Liberty Airport is 38 minutes. Since there are no weather delays we should enjoy our trip up there, and I hope we will be able to close the door soon and get on our way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this particular flight that I am thinking of, the pilot closed the door, we were pushed out with the truck to get into place, and the pilot said: Oh, we just learned air traffic in the New York area is fairly heavy, and our takeoff time is an hour from now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An hour from now, for a 38-minute flight. I looked at my watch many times and couldn't wait for the hour to pass. The pilot gets on the air and says: We have just been advised that we have 23 minutes longer than expected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time that 38 minutes flying time got through, it was 3 hours of time passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just told the story about taking a train down this morning from New York Penn Station, and it was 2 hours and 35 minutes. I was in the city, so I didn't have to travel a half or three-quarters of an hour to get to the airport, and then to be there a half hour or 45 minutes early, so the time consumed just doesn't balance out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to get on with this opportunity to improve our transportation systems because we are being forced into it. We have not planned adequately enough to accommodate travel in our country. We have to act, because we know things are going to worsen, not get better automatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we deal with problems--the occupant of the chair, the Senator from Vermont, and I--we are dealing actively with global warming because of emissions that come from cars, from buildings, from industrial sources, from all kinds of greenhouse gas  sources that are creating global warming. Global warming threatens our families directly. It is said by the most auspicious scientific advisory groups--the National Academy of Sciences, the Union of Concerned Scientists, National Science Foundation--they are saying: Get on with it. You have a 10-year window during which time you can do something about arresting the growth of global warming that will make life quite different on our planet than we are used to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we see ecological disturbances, like male fish in the Potomac River carrying eggs--not the female fish--that is an ominous sign. When we see polar bears on floes that are ragged, watching as the ice melts from under their feet, it is an ominous sign. When we understand that, if the ice melts--and the occupant of the Presiding Officer's chair and I and other Senators were in Greenland not too long ago and watched ice melt, not in little rivulets but almost like waterfalls, and the forecast  is that if that ice melt continues at the pace it is, within 50 years the seas can be 20 feet higher than they are. We have to get on with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an opportunity to make a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases and arrest the momentum of global warming. That rail bill we have is an essential factor in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How about the experience this country has had in these last years when two nuclear energy plants were built, one in New Hampshire and one in Long Island, NY, that had to be virtually abandoned because there was no sensible evacuation route. Rail makes a difference. If rail had been used in Louisiana at the time of Katrina, a lot more people could have escaped some of the fear and the anxiety and the deaths and illnesses that struck people as a result of that terrible storm. Let's get on with  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a commitment under the regular order of business to vote at 4 o'clock on an amendment that talks about showing the subsidy per ticket, offered from our colleague from South Carolina, to make certain that we identify how much we are spending on a subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not saying the same thing has to be done on an air ticket. Aviation is essential. Airlines helped connect this country. We are able to get coast to coast, long distances, in a relatively short time. We subsidize these for-profit companies. They are businesses. Amtrak is a not-for-profit company, so we are going to have to subsidize it. I think now what we are saying is we are stepping up to the plate and getting on with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleague from South Carolina will be able to join us because the time now will be charged to the time allotted for debate. I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum while we wait and ask the time for debate under the quorum call be equally divided.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand at 4 o'clock we have a vote on DeMint amendment No. 3467. I would summarize again the purpose of this amendment and what it entails. We have talked about the importance of disclosure, in letting the American people know how Government operates and actually what it costs them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to Amtrak, we are all very aware that there are heavy subsidies for Amtrak. This works out to an average of over $210 a ticket across the country. In some parts of the country Amtrak is working very well and in other parts of the country, the Federal Government is subsidizing over $500 a ticket to keep this going.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have about 6 minutes left. I suggest we divide it between us so that we have a couple of minutes to respond to the Senator.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>That is fine. I will take a couple more minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment requests full disclosure of the costs of subsidies for each ticket. This would allow passengers and all Americans to know that when they buy a ticket, how much tax dollars go in, in addition to what they pay, to subsidize the price of their ticket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This will do a number of things, I think, that are important. It will not only let the American people know how much they are spending to keep Amtrak going, it will force Amtrak to actually calculate the real costs of operating their lines throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for us as a Congress to make good decisions about Amtrak and allow them to make good decisions about which lines should be discontinued, which ones should be continued, it is important for them to calculate the cost. Right now the way they calculate costs does not allow them to determine the real costs for their lines. I want to make clear we are not trying to cut any funding in this amendment from Amtrak. We are not asking to do anything but what a normal business would do; that is,  to calculate the real cost of operating each of their lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the same as asking a business to determine the cost of all of their product lines so they can determine which are profitable, which are not. In this case, we will determine not only which ones are not profitable, and how much in subsidies there is, but what the real costs are for each line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this as a measure of disclosure for Amtrak, not in any way to harm Amtrak or their operations. I think it is a way to help them be more efficient in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="CHIP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say again to the Senator from South Carolina who just left the Chamber, I appreciate the way he has approached this. He did not come in and condemn it; he looked at it. He had some ideas, and several of them have been accepted. I think he wound up getting five of his ideas that have been accepted. So he has been a constructive force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have found a lot of Members assume we are trying to provide money to Amtrak without any reforms. When they  look at it, I think they are surprised at the number of requirements and plans and reform that we do include in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would be opposed to this amendment. You would have to print on each individual ticket the specific amount of the Government subsidy per passenger for that route. Now, think about it. You know on its face that would take a lot of effort. It is changing. It would cost, I have heard, probably as much as $3 million. I do not want to vouch for that, but there would be some cost. But it is already available. You can get this information through the public Web site. That is available, about what  the cost of the subsidy is on these tickets. So it would provide something that is already available. You would have to pay for it. We have a number of other reporting and disclosure requirements included in this bill. I think it is redundant to what we have in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are focused on trying to reduce subsidies. The point should not be how much is it now per ticket; the point should be: How much is it aggregate and what are we going to do about it? We have got specific markers in this legislation, the metrics and standards that will be required to get us to a reduced amount of subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, again, as I have said earlier, it is a chicken-and-egg thing. You can do it in a responsible and reasonable way and get a result or you can force things that cost money and do not achieve anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, we are not going to reduce the subsidies until we improve the service, improve the capital stock, and do a better job. That is what I believe this legislation will do. So I urge the amendment be defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again thank the Senator from South Carolina for being willing to work with us on a number of amendments he had that actually did add improvements to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor. I do not know if there is any time remaining.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007. First I would like to thank Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott and their staff for all of their hard work on this bill. This bill is the product of true collaboration and I am proud to be an original cosponsor. Serving nearly 26 million riders each year, Amtrak provides an invaluable service to travelers and commuters all over the country and particularly along  the Northeast corridor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in the past few years, we have seen efforts to fully fund and modernize Amtrak thwarted, leaving Amtrak repeatedly underfunded by the administration. This bill will end this pattern of stop-gap funding and provide Amtrak with the resources it needs to improve service and passenger safety as we move forward. As you know, many of the security measures initially included in this bill have already been signed into law as part of the Implementing the 9/11 Recommendations Act. I congratulate  my colleagues on  these accomplishments as these measures will significantly strengthen the security of our passenger rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Amtrak formulates its plan for the future, it is important that it has the funding and support needed to maintain the system and restore operations to high performance levels. By authorizing $10 billion over the next 6 years for repairs and operating costs, in addition to millions in grant funding, Amtrak will be able to accomplish this goal and meet the transportation and safety needs of travelers who rely on the system. This bill will also ensure that Amtrak is able to restore the Northeast  corridor--the most heavily trafficked stretch of the system--to a state of good repair by the end of 2012. This corridor is relied upon by leisure and business travelers alike and is an integral part of the Northeast economy. I am proud to be an original cosponsor on this bill and believe it provides Amtrak with a solid blueprint for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In New York particularly, Amtrak is indispensable to the economy and business community. Thousands of riders travel daily to New York City for meetings, to visit family and friends or for an early dinner before a Broadway show. Amtrak offers New Yorkers reliable and hassle-free access to cities all along the east coast, making it a crucial mode of transportation for hundreds of thousands of travelers each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to working with my colleagues to continue to improve passenger rail service through Federal support and increases in safety and security and I look forward to the final passage of this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="NOT VOTING--8">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as ranking member of Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, I rise to speak in the support of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007. This bill reflects several years of work by Senators Lautenberg, Lott, myself and many others to reform our Nation's passenger rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the 6-year life of the bill, Amtrak's operating subsidy is reduced by 40 percent through cost cutting, restructuring, and reform. This bill authorizes funding for Amtrak's capital and operating needs to maintain current operations, upgrade equipment, and return the Northeast Corridor to a state of good repair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I know that there are some who argue that this bill does not go far enough, I do believe that it is a step in the right direction. In particular, I believe that the State-Amtrak partnerships outlined in this bill--with respect to both the cost allocation and capital match--will be key to ensuring the long-term viability and growth in ridership of intercity passenger rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long advocated for the establishment of an equitable system for States to pay their fair share toward the operating costs related to Amtrak corridor routes. In the Northwest, Amtrak operates the Amtrak Cascades, which provides daily service between Eugene, OR and Vancouver, British Columbia. This service is supported through operating funds provided by the States of Oregon and Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With almost 700,000 riders last year, the Amtrak Cascades is the seventh most heavily traveled corridor in the country and represents a model for partnership among States, Amtrak, freight railroads and local communities. Currently, however, Oregon is one of only 14 States that provide operating funds to support and maintain Amtrak's service. This bill would help change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the capital side, this bill encourages States to get more involved with our national passenger rail system by creating a new State Capital Grant program for intercity passenger rail capital projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program makes grants to a State, or a group of States, to pay for the capital costs of facilities and equipment necessary to provide new or improved intercity passenger rail. The Federal match is 80 percent. Providing States with this option will be a valuable tool to assist them in their transportation planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across the country and across all transportation modes, congestion is becoming more and more of a problem, and, unfortunately, it is only going to get worse. Increasing the use of passenger rail, particularly within more densely populated corridors such as the Cascades corridor I mentioned earlier, should be part of our national strategy to fight congestion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be noted that intercity and commuter passenger railroads are one of the cleanest forms of transportation. On a per passenger mile, Amtrak is 17 percent more energy efficient that domestic airline travel and 21 percent more efficient than auto travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to talk quickly about ridership and financial performance. In fiscal year 2007, Amtrak ridership increased to 25,847,000, marking the fifth straight year of gains and setting a record for the most passengers using Amtrak since its creation in 1971.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, total ticket revenue for the fiscal year topped $1.5 billion, up 11 percent over the previous fiscal year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More people are using Amtrak today than ever before, and given the transportation capacity constraints our country will face in the coming years, I believe it would be a mistake if we didn't make the investments now--in both time and money--to try to reform the system to ensure that passenger trains are a viable transportation alternative in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't believe that this is a perfect bill, but I do believe that it is a step in the right direction, and I hope my colleagues will support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="NOT VOTING--8">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act of 2007. I commend Senators Lautenberg, Carper, and Lott for their excellent work on this bill, and I am proud to co-sponsor it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak is certainly important to my home State of Connecticut. Amtrak operates 46 daily trains in Connecticut, serving almost 1.5 million passengers each year. New Haven is the twelth busiest train station in the entire Amtrak system, with over 630,000 passengers annually. Amtrak is also a significant employer in my State, providing 575 jobs to Connecticut residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These Connecticut facts provide me with robust reasons to champion Amtrak, but I also believe that we must have a strong national passenger rail system. We rely on the heavily used Northeast corridor to provide a convenient transportation option for those traveling between Washington, DC and Boston. The capital funding authorization in the legislation before us will require that Amtrak develop a spending plan to improve infrastructure along the corridor, which will lead to reduced travel time  and delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also an important environmental reason to support Amtrak. Global warming is a real problem, and we need to figure out sensible ways to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. We can only solve this national crisis if we work together collectively. As far as Amtrak is concerned, we cannot focus solely on the East and West coast train corridors. Instead, we need to figure out ways to increase ridership for as many routes as possible. This bill requires Amtrak to become more efficient in delivering  its long distance service by implementing performance improvement plans for trains with low ridership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act also creates a new State Capital Grant program for inter-city passenger rail projects. With a Federal match of 80 percent, the Secretary of Transportation will select worthy projects based on environmental impact, economic benefit, and anticipated ridership. I want to underscore the importance of this new grant program. The era of cheap oil is over, and our Nation's security depends on implementing innovative energy and transportation alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last Amtrak authorization bill expired in 2002, so the time for this bill's passage is overdue. Amtrak deserves a stable funding blueprint for the next 5 fiscal years. Without such certainty, it is impossible for Amtrak to succeed and meet the considerable challenges and goals we have placed before them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleagues again for a job well done on a bipartisan piece of legislation that builds a strong consensus on the next generation of passenger rail in the United States.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007, offered by Senators Lautenberg and Lott. I signed on as a cosponsor of this bill soon after  it was introduced because this legislation provides a much-needed and long overdue investment in the future of passenger rail in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits of a strong passenger rail network are clear: Amtrak helps reduce congestion on our highways in an environmental-friendly manner. Anyone who travels regularly on our Nation's highways recognizes that we need a comprehensive solution to our congestion problems that involves multiple modes of transportation. We need to do so, however, in a way that reduces carbon emissions. Passenger rail is key to these efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak has made great strides in recent years in terms of its on-time performance, its commitment to high speed rail, and its emphasis on increased ridership. While Amtrak still has work to do on the longer distance routes serving Pennsylvania and other parts of the country, the well-documented ontime performance of the Acela Express in the Northeast corridor is a perfect example of the possibilities that result from appropriate investments in rail infrastructure. At the end of fiscal year 2007,  Amtrak officials reported that ontime performance for Acela Express was 87.8 percent, up more than 3 percent over the same period in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northeast corridor is not the only area where Amtrak is making progress. Pennsylvania's Keystone line, operating between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, ranks fifth in ridership and revenue growth among all Amtrak services. Many of my constituents use this line to travel between Harrisburg and Lancaster and on to Philadelphia and New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are considering here today also would create a new State Capital Grant Program for intercity passenger rail capital projects. The program would authorize the awarding of grants to a State, or a group of States, to pay for the capital costs of infrastructure, facilities, and equipment necessary to provide new or improved intercity passenger rail. This new program is particularly of interest in Pennsylvania, as we continue to look at reinstituting routes, particularly between  Scranton and the New York metropolitan area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is my hope that this new investment will spur Amtrak to address outstanding labor issues that have simply gone on for too long. Amtrak's infrastructure upgrades should be coupled with investments in its workforce, and I, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate and the House, will continue to closely monitor this situation in the coming weeks and months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today would authorize an increase in Federal funding for the operation and development of passenger rail services, reauthorize Amtrak for an additional 6 years, and provide much needed reform of the Nation's rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation makes an important first step to establish high-speed rail systems throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A strong national rail system provides Americans with a practical transportation alternative, helps to alleviate traffic congestion on our Nation's highways and reduces harmful greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would also require an increase in financial and operation transparency and accountability at Amtrak, reduce Federal operating subsidies, and improve train performance and customer service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Amtrak serves nearly 25 million riders each year at more than 500 stations across 46 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak is also one of the Nation's largest providers of contracted commuter service for State and regional authorities. Over 60 million commuters in California, Maryland, Connecticut, Washington, and Virginia take Amtrak to work each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California's partnership with Amtrak represents the largest State-supported passenger rail program in the United States. Each day, Amtrak operates approximately 70 intercity trains and 100 commuter trains in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak's corridors in California are also among the busiest in the Nation, with more than 10 million Californians boarding Amtrak during fiscal year 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pacific Surfliner service from San Diego through Los Angeles is the second busiest corridor in the United States with over 2.5 million riders in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Capitol Corridor service between Sacramento and San Jose is the third most traveled corridor in the country with over 1 million riders in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Home to two of the Nation's top five most congested cities in the United States, my home State of California understands the importance of viable travel alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passenger rail services have helped ease highway congestion, reduce automobile emissions and improve the State's air quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California is well ahead of the curve on developing a transportation system that has low environmental impact yet meets the growing needs of the California economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is still much more work to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is expected that California's population will grow to more than 50 million people by 2030.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California would need to build about 3,000 additional lane-miles on intercity highways and over 90 new gates and five new airport runways to serve the expected population in 2030.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of California and the California High-Speed Rail Authority are working to develop a high-speed rail system which would stretch from San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento in the north, to Los Angeles and San Diego in the south.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With trains operating at speeds up to 220 mph, the travel time from downtown San Francisco to Los Angeles would be just under 2 1/2  hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As envisioned, California's high-speed train system could accommodate nearly 120 million passengers annually by 2030.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This state-of-the-art rail system would take millions of cars off the road, ease traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and allow people to travel faster, safer and more comfortably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To move our great Nation into the next era of modern, efficient, environmentally friendly transportation, all levels of public and private finances and resources must be brought to bear. This legislation is an important first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investment in America's passenger rail system is important for California. It is important for this Nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank Senators Lautenberg and Lott for their hard work in bringing this important bill to the floor. They have worked on this issue for years and have always done so in a bipartisan manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill which helps our Nation in many ways, not the least of which is relieving congestion on our overcrowded transportation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are facing a congestion crisis in this country today, and the problem is only getting worse. Congestion causes Americans to travel 4.2 billion hours longer and purchase an extra 2.9 billion gallons of gas each year, for a total congestion cost of $78 billion. This is an increase from 2004 of 220 million hours, 140 million gallons of gas, and $5 billion. The Texas Transportation Institute calculates that the cost to the average traveler is $710 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans are not just facing congestion on our roads; we're facing it in our skies and at our airports too. Across the country, flights are being delayed longer and longer, while passengers sit in the terminal or are forced to sit on the tarmac. Airlines are overwhelmed trying to balance the increased demand for air travel with the shrinking space in our skies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak is a big part of the solution to this congestion crisis. Amtrak trains take cars off the roads and offer passengers a faster, more comfortable alternative to air travel for short-distance trips.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the average Amtrak train emits two-thirds less global warming pollution per passenger mile than cars and trucks and half the global warming pollution of airplanes. We can already see the environmental benefits of Amtrak service, despite centuries-old tracks and aging equipment. This bill is critical because it will lay the groundwork for Amtrak to achieve its full potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The technology behind trains continues to improve and is more efficient. With the right Federal investment, we can see energy-efficient, high-speed trains moving passengers between cities cleaner and quicker than by car or plane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are beginning to see these benefits in my home State, as the State of Illinois doubled its investment in passenger rail last year. Thanks to that investment, Amtrak trains in Illinois have seen phenomenal growth on the trains from Chicago to St. Louis, Quincy, and Carbondale. This past year, those three routes saw the greatest increase in ridership of any line in the Amtrak system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chicago-Quincy routes--the Illinois Zephyr and the Carl Sandburg--have seen 41.4 percent growth in ridership in the last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chicago-St. Louis line--the Lincoln--saw a 55.8 percent increase in ridership since we have expanded service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chicago-Carbondale routes--the Illini and the Saluki--have seen an outstanding boost of 67.4 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These routes helped propel Amtrak to its fifth straight year of record ridership and ticket revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The demand is only increasing, as even more Illinois communities are clamoring for passenger rail service. The Illinois Department of Transportation and Amtrak have released a feasibility study demonstrating that passenger rail service from Chicago to Rockford is very competitive with car travel, and we expect another feasibility study soon, which will show that the same is true for service from Chicago to the Quad Cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In States such as Illinois that invest in passenger rail, we are seeing fewer cars on the road and increased economic activity along the train lines. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 recognizes theses benefits and rewards States that make capital and operating investment in passenger rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the managers of this bill for including the State Capital Grants Program, which will give States real incentives to invest in expanding passenger rail corridors. The Illinois model proves that with the right investment, we can move Americans out of traffic jams and into a cleaner, more reliable mode of transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are considering Amtrak's authorization, an authorization that expired in 2002. We already have let too much time pass without capitalizing on the huge demand for passenger rail service. We must pass this bill now to pave the way for the restoration and expansion of Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak's success is despite the President's repeated underfunding--or nonfunding--of passenger rail in his budgets. It is a testament to the Senate and to the Congress that we have repeatedly rejected attempts by the administration and others who oppose Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now as we stand at a crossroads of rail service in the United States, communities are increasingly vocal about their demand for cheaper, cleaner transportation options. Intercity rail service is an integral component to meeting these needs. The expansion of Amtrak service is far more than refitting rails and building new stations; it is about economic development, relieving congestion on our roads, improving our environment, and making life easier for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN AMTRAK AS A NATIONAL PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) In fiscal year 2007, 3,800,000 passengers traveled on Amtrak's long distance trains, an increase of 2.4 percent over fiscal year 2006.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Amtrak long-distance routes generated $376,000,000 in revenue in fiscal year 2007, an increase of 5 percent over fiscal year 2006.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Amtrak operates 15 long-distance trains over 18,500 route miles that serve 39 States and the District of Columbia. These trains provide the only rail passenger service to 23 States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Amtrak's long-distance trains provide an essential transportation service for many communities and to a significant percentage of the general public.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Many long-distance trains serve small communities with limited or no significant air or bus service, especially in remote or isolated areas in the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) As a result of airline deregulation and decisions by national bus carriers to leave many communities, rail transportation may provide the only feasible common carrier transportation option for a growing number of areas.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) If long-distance trains were eliminated, 23 States and 243 communities would be left with no intercity passenger rail service and 16 other States would lose some rail service. These trains provide a strong economic benefit for the States and communities that they serve.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Long-distance trains also provide transportation during periods of severe weather or emergencies that stall other modes of transportation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Amtrak provided the only reliable long-distance transportation following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that grounded air travel.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) The majority of passengers on long-distance trains do not travel between the endpoints, but rather between any combination of cities along the route.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) Passenger trains provide transportation options, mobility for underserved populations, congestion mitigation, and jobs in the areas they serve.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) Passenger rail has a positive impact on the environment compared to other modes of transportation by conserving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting down on other airborne particulate and toxic emissions.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) Amtrak communities that are served use passenger rail and passenger rail stations as a significant source of economic development.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) This Act makes meaningful and important reforms to increase the efficiency, profitability and on-time performance of Amtrak's long-distance routes.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) long-distance passenger rail is a vital and necessary part of our national transportation system and economy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Amtrak should maintain a national passenger rail system, including long-distance routes, that connects the continental United States from coast to coast and from border to border.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 225. PASSENGER RAIL STUDY.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the General Accountability Office shall conduct a study to determine the potential cost and benefits of expanding passenger rail service options in underserved communities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Submission.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a report containing the results of the study conducted under this section to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.</narrative>

  <narrative>The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.</narrative>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I must say how satisfying it is that the Senate has done what America has asked us to do. I can't tell you how involved personally I have been in this for many years. Since my relatively early days in the Senate, going back decades, I have been interested in what we could do to make Amtrak an integral part of the transportation system, to make Amtrak easier and more reliable for the American people. They asked us to do this, to give them relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to say to Senator Lott how much I have appreciated working with him--not only now, but we have done so for a number of years. We have the satisfaction of seeing this bill pass and we hope on its way to becoming law. With 70 votes, this is a clear message about what the representatives of the American people are saying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Lott. It has been a pleasure working with him. As I am sure he agrees, I look forward to having more opportunities to do things in a bipartisan nature to help the American people. They asked us for relief and we are giving it to them--relief from traffic congestion, relief from lines at the airports, and relief from planes lined up on the tarmac. Today, the Senate has said to American travelers: You will have another choice, and the choice is passenger rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to note the wide margin by which the Passenger Rail Investment Improvement Act of 2007 has been approved in the Senate. The bill is going to speed passenger rail service in the United States into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many people I wish to thank in addition to my friend and colleague from Mississippi, the minority whip, Senator Lott, who has had a long-standing commitment to passenger rail service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to thank Senator Inouye, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, for giving me the privilege of pursuing and managing this legislation. His confidence has always been appreciated by me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the majority leader, Harry Reid, for his leadership and decisiveness to work to bring our bill to the floor, and I thank his staff for their support. In particular, the floor staff, including Lula Davis, Marty Paone, Tim Mitchell, and Trisha Engle. On the Republican side, everybody was cooperative. I thank David Schiappa, Laura Dove, and Jodie Hernandez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank all of our cosponsors of the bill. I particularly wish to focus on Senator Carper's help and his hard work and constant support for Amtrak, along with all of our cosponsors' dedication and commitment to improving travel in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Alex Kummant, the CEO of Amtrak, and his government affairs staff, including Joe McHugh and Caroline Decker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my staff, of which I am very proud. They are always there, no matter what the hours or the intensity of the work are. They are there with their support, their knowledge and research and their constant concern for making sure we do things right. My staff includes David Matsuda, Dan Katz, Doug Mehan, and Meg Slachetka.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the Senator's kind remarks. It was a pleasure working with him on this legislation. It has been a long time coming. I appreciate the active involvement he has had, along with other Senators on both sides of the aisle, including Senator Carper of Delaware.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a long history of trying to get this passed freestanding through the Senate. We have to give credit to our leadership and to Senator Reid in particular. He had to make this happen. We tried last year repeatedly to get it freestanding or to get a window to offer it. We never could get it agreed to at that time. Senator Reid carved out a pretty big block of time for a Transportation bill. He didn't have to do that. He deserves credit for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank my staff, including Anne Marie Turner, who is here with me; Chris Bertram, who has been working with me for years; and Beth Spivey. Our staffs work together great. I am pleased with the Republicans who voted for it and probably all of the Democrats voted for it. I hope the House will act on this expeditiously. This could be a big step in the right direction. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their cooperation. I hope we can do more of this sort of thing in the  future. I thank the Senator for letting me interrupt his remarks.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Not at all. I, too, thank Anne Marie Turner of Senator Lott's staff. She was always there, and I could tell by the expression on her face at a given moment whether we were on the right or wrong track in talking about Amtrak. I also thank Chris Bertram and Beth Spivey of his staff as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the staff from the Senate Commerce Committee, including Stephen Gardner, who is always so helpful and has extensive knowledge about transportation. Chairman Inouye was so gracious in making sure we were supported with the assistance of Mr. Gardner. Also, I thank Melissa Porter, who is on loan as a detailee from the Federal Railroad Administration; Shira Bergstein, from Senator Inouye's majority staff; Betsy McDonnell and Dan Neuman, from Senator Gordon Smith's  and Senator Stevens's Committee minority staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Getting legislation passed by this body takes a lot of work, and these folks are to be commended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone knows our highways are jammed. We don't have to tell them that from here. All they have to think about is what time they get out of work and what time they get home and what time do they have to leave in the morning to get to work on time. In New Jersey, the most densely populated State in the country, we spend 300 hours commuting by car every year. Fifteen percent of that time is wasted sitting in traffic, creating pollution, creating anxiety, anger, frustration, and bigger bills as  gas prices go up at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With more than 220 million vehicles on the road and the population projected to pass the 400 million mark before 2050, congestion will remain a major challenge if cars and trucks remain the dominant mode of travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned earlier in this debate that our population in 1971, when Amtrak was developed as a government corporation, was 200 million. Now, barely 36 years later, we are 300 million. We haven't made much progress in upgrading our rail systems even after our country has grown by 100 million people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now we are feeling the effects. Our skies are becoming jammed as more planes take to the air. Last year was the worst year for flight delays since 2000. One in four planes were late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For travelers who fly, for instance, between Washington and the New York/New Jersey area, a 36-minute flight often becomes 2 or more hours because of delays getting off the ground and, once there, getting off the plane. I once flew up to LaGuardia Airport, and we waited an hour to get to the gate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The airlines have admitted this and have revised their schedules to reflect that now this 36-minute flight should be expected to take 2 hours: 36 minutes in the air, and the rest of the time admiring the landscape, which is pretty dismal when you see all these planes lined up on the tarmac like cars in traffic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between lines of cars on the highways and long lines at the airports, America's travelers need and deserve another choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer is a world-class passenger rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Riding a train saves people money. The national average cost per gallon of gasoline is over $2.80 a gallon. I have even heard estimates that we will see oil at $200 a barrel before too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at all the benefits to travelers, we see that riding a train can save time, money, and congestion in other modes of transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For instance, rail service often delivers passengers directly to where they need to go, as train stations are more frequently located in city centers. I can tell my colleagues from personal experience, since I road the train as recently as this morning, that riding the train was a pleasurable experience. It gave me a chance to read, to communicate, and even nod off for a couple of minutes. It was really a nice way to travel. Passengers can work on laptops, talk on the phone, walk around on the  train, and generally be productive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Riding the train also helps secure our country's future by improving the environment. Amtrak trains are on average 17 percent more fuel efficient than passenger airlines, and 21 percent more fuel efficient than passenger cars, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, trains produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions than cars, trucks, and planes, and per mile locomotives emit about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than airplanes and still less than automobiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trains also save lives. If there was ever a moment that demonstrated how much America needed a passenger rail system, it was in the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. On 9/11, when our airports were shut down, Amtrak was able to get travelers back to their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 9/11, airports were shut down. Amtrak was able to get travelers back to their families. During Hurricane Katrina, trains could have helped evacuate persons from those affected cities if our Government was better prepared to employ them. Trains sat idly by waiting for passengers to come aboard to be taken away from the center of the hurricane, but they could not get to the train. The Government wasn't there to lend a hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is great enthusiasm for passenger rail service in America. Amtrak's record ridership of 26 million passengers last year can attest to that fact. The potential of new railcars in our country is enormous. Efficient rail service between Chicago and other Midwest cities, such as St. Louis, Detroit, and Cleveland would revolutionize the way people travel in an entire vital region of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, a proposed passenger rail line serving Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, and points in between would allow people options besides braving Interstate 95 traffic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we foster passenger rail service that is viable, reliable, and comfortable, many will choose rail as an alternative, and Amtrak's record ridership has proven that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's action by the Senate is a victory for anyone who is tired of sitting in traffic or waiting in an airport and for people who work so hard to make a living and often live far away from work, far away from their homes. I remember a conversation I had with a man who worked in New York City who bought a house 50 miles away from his job. His thought, he said, for him and his family, in addition to seeing some green space, was that he would save money, he would be able to put his children in  a house with some room. Now when I see the same man, he is distraught because of the cost for gasoline. The cost for the time lost in traffic outweighs the advantages he  thought he would have. That is not an uncommon situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support and look forward to completing this legislation in this Congress and getting it signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to hearing from our colleague, Senator Carper from Delaware, who worked so hard and has for many years. He is a frequent user, as they say of Amtrak, that is. We appreciate his hard work and the opportunity we shared to work together to get this legislation considered and passed today in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Delaware.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300019" topic="TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, while Senator Lautenberg is still on the floor, I wish to express my thanks and the thanks of my constituents in Delaware to him and Senator Lott for the partnership they forged in bringing us to the reauthorization victory we celebrate this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stephen Gardner is still on the floor. Stephen was a member of my personal staff when I was first elected to the Senate. He is succeeded by Beth Osborne. We have a great working relationship with him. He has great talent. He is someone who has not just been in Washington and the Senate, but he worked for railroads in the past, including Amtrak. Given his experience, he was invaluable in providing guidance and support in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to speak briefly, and then I am going to make a unanimous consent request that we go into morning business so that Senator Alexander and I may engage in a colloquy on another matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this: I have come from a meeting at the other end of the Capitol, that may still be going on, that started around 2 o'clock. I stayed for almost an hour and a half. The meeting involved members of organized labor and several leaders in the House of Representatives who have jurisdiction, Democrat and Republican, over infrastructure and passenger rail. The meeting was driven in part because of the threat of a potential work stoppage on our passenger rail system. It turns out that most  Amtrak employees, hourly workers who work in the shops and work on the trains, have not had a pay raise in about 7 or 8 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not a good situation. In fact, I think it is a  grossly unfair situation and very much a sad situation for them and for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope, and part of my encouragement and support for this legislation, is that I think it provides a roadmap for going forward with passenger rail service in this country in the 21st century. We need a roadmap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lautenberg and others have spoken as to why we need to do things differently--congestion on our highways and in our airports, in the skies, enormous reliance on foreign oil, too much bad stuff going into our air. There are all kinds of reasons people are beginning to ride trains more and more and why we need to provide supporting leadership at the Federal level, at the same time entering into partnership with State and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The beauty behind this legislation is that the Federal Government says we are going to take charge and upgrade the Northeast corridor, bring it to a state of good repair. In doing that, we unleash the potential in the Northeast corridor, including bringing in the more expensive high-speed Acela train which I helped create as a member of the Amtrak board when I was Governor of Delaware, to the extent we can just let them run at 100 miles an hour, 110, maybe something close to 150 miles an hour.  Their ontime performance is up to 90 percent, and we would like to make it higher so we can fill up the seats on the Acela. We are close to doing that. They can be a cash cow in generating revenues we need to support other passenger rail service in the Northeast corridor and in other parts of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the good provisions in this legislation is bringing the Northeast corridor into a state of good repair and authorizing money to be spent for that purpose, for capital improvement. Amtrak for years has been starved for capital. Along with providing pay raises for the employees, that is first and foremost what we need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A second major change in this legislation, for areas outside the corridor, whether it is Tennessee or Colorado, in places where we have densely populated corridors, where the State and local governments would actually like to have high-speed or higher speed rail and run trains, maybe just for 200 miles or 300 miles, and provide better service such as they are doing out of Chicago and out of the west coast where ridership is up 10, 20, 30, even 40 percent--States are involved in that partnership  with the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation says if a Governor of a State--Senator Alexander and I are former Governors. When we were Governors, if we wanted to enter into an agreement with the Federal Government to build a new road or highway, the Federal Government would provide 80 percent. If we wanted to get improvements to our airports, the Federal Government provided 80 percent of the money and the State provide 20 percent. If we wanted improvements with respect to transit service, the Federal Government  would provide 50 percent, and the State would provide half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But a better solution, a more cost-effective solution, happens to be intercity passenger rail, and the Federal Government provided zero and the State had to provide all the money. Even if intercity passenger rail was a smarter solution, it received no support from the Federal Government. This bill changes that situation. It puts passenger rail funding on the same level as airports and the same level as roads, highways, and bridges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes a whole lot of sense. If States believe they would rather spend their 20 percent on airports, roads, highways, or bridges, they can do that. But if they think rail makes sense as part of the solution, they can do that as well with the same kind of incentive. That is good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a bunch of long-distance trains that don't make money; they lose money, quite a bit of money. We have 16 long-distance trains in this country. We direct the Federal Railroad Administration to take five of those long-distance trains next year, five the year after that, and five the year after that and scrub them, look at them, look at what they are doing well and what they are doing badly and what we need to do to reduce the amount of money we are spending to provide passenger rail service  in those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to run trains if people don't want to ride them. That is not what we should be about. The real secret to doing well with passenger rail in this country and, frankly, other countries is to find those densely populated corridors. There are a lot of them. A lot are along the coast. Over half the people in our country live within 50 miles of one of our coasts. We have corridors up and down the east coast from Maine to Florida, the gulf coast, the west coast from San Diego up to the Canadian  border, up to Vancouver, in fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passenger rail can do a lot to help us there, particularly 300-, 400-mile routes. People would just as soon ride a train on the Northeast corridor than to drive or take an airplane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another thing that makes sense is these corridors in our country, such as Chicago to St. Louis--that is a great corridor and there are others like that corridor in other parts of the country where passenger rail can be part of the solution. Those are the kinds of things we wanted to work on, to build.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, some are interested in competition for freight rail. If they want to come in and run passenger rail service, under this legislation they can compete if they want to. They are not barred from competing. They have the opportunity to do that as well, and the legislation encourages that kind of competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will close with this comment. My hope is that the reauthorizing legislation we passed today will be warmly received in the House. I think it will be. I am encouraged that it will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I hope it demonstrates to our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, that we are not going to be business as usual at Amtrak. There is a new day and, frankly, a better business strategy going forward. My hope is that confidence will be reflected in greater appropriations bills, in the House and in the Senate, so Amtrak cannot only make the kinds of investments in infrastructure for Amtrak--rail, overhead wires, signaling systems, rolling stock--but also  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="13567">S13567</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is we can do all those, and the passage of this legislation will help us in that direction, plus reduce a little bit of our dependence on foreign oil, plus reduce the emission of bad stuff into our air, reduce congestion at our airports and in our skies and on our highways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do all that we ought to declare victory. The thing I love most about what happened here this week and last week on this bill is Democrats and Republicans did it together; we actually worked together and I applaud the efforts of Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott and I especially wish to say thanks to our leader, Senator Reid, for making time on the schedule for us to have this debate, to follow through on it; and my colleagues on both sides who participated in  the debate and offered reasonable amendments, some of which were adopted. This place actually functioned the way I think people of this country expect us to.</paragraph>
