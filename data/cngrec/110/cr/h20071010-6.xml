  <narrative>URGING MEMBERS TO SIGN ON TO KIRK-CARNEY-POE-BERMAN-HARMAN LETTER REGARDING ARMS SALES TO SAUDI ARABIA -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11397]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. KIRK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is sad when another country turns its arms against the United States or our allies, but it is a tragedy when those arms were made by Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us remember when advanced F-14 Tomcat fighters were provided to the Kingdom of Iran only to see these airplanes become the backbone of the ayatollah's air force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Newspapers indicate that the United States will now offer a large arms sales package to the Saudi Kingdom. And while much of what is proposed looks useful against Iran, patrol craft and warning radars, satellite-guided bombs pose a particular danger if used in the wrong hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These satellite-guided bombs, called Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, are particularly lethal in battle, and if misused against American forces or our allies in Israel, their effect could be not just devastating but tragic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not provide such weapons without ironclad, written guarantees to the Congress that such munitions could not pose a danger to future Americans or our allies. I urge Members to sign the Kirk-Carney-Poe-Berman-Harman letter to block this sale unless guarantees are made.</paragraph>
