  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democrat majority in this House has said they have a plan to lower gas prices and help make America more energy independent. Since January 2007, we have seen no plan but we have seen the price of gas go up over $1 per gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our outdated domestic refinery capacity, our dependence on foreign oil, and a growing global demand for oil are responsible for the increase in oil prices. So we need to target those issues. We need to build more refineries in the United States, promote all alternative energy sources, and tap unexplored oil and natural gas reserves, including ANWR. This majority wants to target the American taxpayer and raise taxes on American companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to stop turning our backs on the resources we have here at home and start reinvigorating our energy infrastructure. We need to start investing in American ingenuity and alternative fuels and stop trying to tax our way to energy independence while blaming American companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
