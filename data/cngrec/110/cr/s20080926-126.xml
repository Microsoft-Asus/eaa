FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892 et seq.) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) by redesignating sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307, respectively; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) by inserting after section 301 the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"SEC. 302.

"(2) These mission requirements and capabilities, which today are located in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, evolved over time to include--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) research, development, operations, products, and services associated with hydrographic, geodetic, shoreline, and baseline surveying;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) cartography, mapping, and charting;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) tides, currents, and water level observations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) maintenance of a national spatial reference system; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) associated products and services.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(3) There is a need to maintain Federal expertise and capability in hydrographic data and services to support a safe and efficient marine transportation system for the enhancement and promotion of international trade and interstate commerce vital to the Nation's economic prosperity and for myriad other commercial and recreational activities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(4) The Nation's marine transportation system is becoming increasingly congested, the volume of international maritime commerce is expected to double within the next 20 years, and nearly half of the cargo transiting United States waters is oil, refined petroleum products, or other hazardous substances.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(5) In addition to commerce, hydrographic data and services support other national needs for the Great Lakes and coastal waters, the territorial sea, the Exclusive Economic Zone, and the continental shelf of the United States, including--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) emergency response;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) homeland security;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) marine resource conservation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) coastal resiliency to sea-level rise, coastal inundation, and other hazards;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) ocean and coastal science advancement; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(F) improved and integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations for an integrated ocean observing system.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(6) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in cooperation with other agencies and the States, serves as the Nation's leading civil authority for establishing and maintaining national standards and datums for hydrographic data and services.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(7) The Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey serves as the National Hydrographer and the primary United States representative to the international hydrographic community, including the International Hydrographic Organization.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(8) The hydrographic expertise, data, and services of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provide the underlying and authoritative basis for baseline and boundary demarcation, including the establishment of marine and coastal territorial limits and jurisdiction, such as the Exclusive Economic Zone.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(9) Research, development and application of new technologies will further increase efficiency, promote the Nation's competitiveness, provide social and economic benefits, enhance safety and environmental protection, and reduce risks.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(b) PURPOSES.--The purposes of this Act are--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(1) to augment the ability of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to fulfill its responsibilities under this and other authorities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(2) to provide more accurate and up-to-date hydrographic data and services in support of safe and efficient international trade and interstate commerce, including--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) hydrographic surveys;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) electronic navigational charts;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) real-time tide, water level, and current information and forecasting;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) shoreline surveys; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) geodesy and 3-dimensional positioning data;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(3) to support homeland security, emergency response, ecosystem approaches to marine management, and coastal resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services with many other useful operational, scientific, engineering, and management applications, including--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) storm surge, tsunami, coastal flooding, erosion, and pollution trajectory monitoring, predictions, and warnings;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) marine and coastal geographic information systems;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) habitat restoration;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) long-term sea-level trends; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) more accurate environmental assessments and monitoring;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(4) to promote improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations through increased coordination and cooperation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(5) to provide for and support research and development in hydrographic data, services and related technologies to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and availability of hydrographic data and services and thereby promote the Nation's scientific and technological competitiveness;
