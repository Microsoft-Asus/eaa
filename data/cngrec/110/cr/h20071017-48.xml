  <narrative>UNJUST PROSECUTION AND HARSH TREATMENT OF RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11697]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today is day 274 of incarceration for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two decorated Border Patrol agents with exemplary records, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal American drug smuggler, are serving 11 and 12 years in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the agents' convictions, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have called for justice for these two border agents. You just heard the Congressman from Texas (Mr. Poe) speak about this issue in a 1-minute speech. These two decorated agents were doing their duty to enforce the law and did not deserve to spend 1 day in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these two men appeal their convictions, they continue to languish in solitary confinement. Nine months of solitary confinement is unacceptable. The Bureau of Prisons has violated its own guidelines which state  that administrative detention is intended to be used for "short periods not to exceed 90 days."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although former law enforcement officers face increased safety risks in prison, the harmful effects of prolonged solitary confinement are well-documented. Solitary confinement is not an acceptable long-term solution for ensuring their physical safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, I was pleased to join my friend, Congressman Rohrabacher, and many other of my friends, including Congressman Poe, in signing a letter to Mr. Michael Mukasey. This letter asked that, upon confirmation, the new Attorney General will thoroughly examine the flaws of this prosecution and will put an end to the harsh treatment these agents are receiving in prison. A directive from the Director of the Bureau of Prisons or the Attorney General can correct this unfair treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with an unbiased review by the incoming Attorney General, I am hopeful that this gross miscarriage of justice will be corrected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say in closing, Madam Speaker, to the families of Mr. Ramos and Mr. Compean, please know that there are many of us in the United States Congress, the House and the Senate, that are trying to do what is right for your loved ones. This is an injustice that should not be allowed to continue. We need to bring justice to this injustice for these two men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God continue to bless America and our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
