  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - December 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10822">S10822</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="FALLEN PENNSYLVANIANS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as we bring the 110th Congress to a close, our Nation confronts a daunting set of challenges. While we face the gravest crisis, perhaps, since the Great Depression, we must also remember that we are a nation at war. From Iraq to Afghanistan, from the Pacific to Europe and countless places in between, American service men and women are proudly carrying out their duties to protect our country and our way of life. Under stressful conditions and the constant threat of danger,  members of our Armed Forces do what it takes to get the job done every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this holiday season, I wish to take a moment to express my gratitude to our servicemembers. Their personal courage and honor should not be taken for granted but genuinely appreciated. I know that is the sentiment of the Senate on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, on behalf of my family, the people of Pennsylvania, and people throughout the country, I thank the members of our armed services and their families, especially those who  gave, as Lincoln said, "the last full measure of devotion to their country." To the families of those who have died or for those family members who are remembering those who are far away serving our country, in either instance, either by way of the loss of a loved one or because  of distance, there is obviously a void in their lives. The words of the great recording artist Bruce Springsteen come to mind when I think of what these families are living through today. I remember the words from a song he wrote right after the 9/11 tragedy as he came out with a number of songs. One of them was "Missing." Some of the lines from that song go as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe so many families feel that today. They know that someone who was in their lives, a member of their family, a son or daughter, a husband or wife who was among them and living and then went off to serve and lost their life, they feel that sense of missing a family member or a loved one. But even if they are just away for 6 months or a couple of months or even a year, they are missing, especially at this holiday season. So we are thinking of them today, those families who are living with  that loss or living with that void.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far, 190 sons and daughters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have sacrificed their lives during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since the last time I paid tribute to those who have fallen, 21 Pennsylvania families have lost their loved ones. Today I would like to honor each of them by reading their names into the RECORD:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To each of their families, please know our thoughts are with you today. I extend my sincere gratitude to each of these men and women for accepting the call to service. These men were courageous warriors who belonged to the finest military in the world and contributed to something larger than themselves. Later this week I will honor those who lost their lives during Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also personally thank the men and women of the Pennsylvania National Guard. The Pennsylvania Guard's motto is "civilian in peace, soldier in war." They have certainly lived up to that motto. With two units deploying this winter and spring, the Pennsylvania National Guard is in the midst of its largest deployment since the Korean war. The 20,000 members of the Pennsylvania National Guard who give up the comforts of their civilian lives at a moment's notice, who protect Americans in the mountains  of Afghanistan, the sands of Iraq, and worldwide, and who rescue Americans from devastating floods and natural disasters deserve our highest praise. Therefore, at this holiday season, I want the men and women in service to our country to know we are thinking of them, we are praying for their safety and well-being and for that of their families.</paragraph>
