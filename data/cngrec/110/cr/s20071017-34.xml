    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Rapid City Chapter of the Salvation Army as they celebrate 100 years of dedicated service to the local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last century, the Salvation Army of Rapid City has stood ready to assist South Dakotans of all ages through a variety of services including disaster relief, food and nutrition services, family counseling, health services, and many others. They own and operate the Black Hills Salvation Army Camp and the Rapid City Salvation Army Thrift Store. This "church with its sleeves rolled up" serves as a shining example of an organization that is meeting the needs of South Dakota's citizens both  physically and spiritually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Salvation Army would not be able to perform its invaluable mission without the hard work and dedication of the many volunteers and officers who have put in countless hours serving the needs of others. These compassionate individuals are truly the backbone of the Rapid City community and I hope that their service will inspire others to lend a helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to rise with the State of South Dakota in congratulating the Salvation Army of Rapid City on this important anniversary and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
