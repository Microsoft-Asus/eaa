  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="CORPORAL CHRISTIAN SCOTT COTNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the memory of Marine Cpl Christian Scott Cotner of Waterbury, CT, who died last week while serving our Nation in Iraq. He was 20 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 30, 2008, Corporal Cotner's life was tragically cut short as he served his first tour of duty with the Marines in Al-Anbar Province, Iraq. His heroic service is remembered today by a grateful nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Friends and loved ones remember Corporal Cotner for his positive attitude, his great sense of humor and his pride in serving the country he loved. It was while in high school, where he volunteered to serve in the honor guards and the ROTC, that Corporal Cotner decided to serve his country, and shortly after graduating he joined the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us in the State of Connecticut and across the United States owe a deep and solemn debt of gratitude to Christian Cotner and to his family and friends for his tremendous service to our country. On behalf of the Senate, I offer my deepest condolences to Christian's parents Graham and Karen and to everyone who knew and loved him.</paragraph>
