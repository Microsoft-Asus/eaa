    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to recognize Ms. Jo Price Craven, principal of Piner Elementary School in Morning City, KY. Ms. Jo Price Craven was recently honored by the National Association of Elementary School Principals as one of the recipients of the 2008 National Distinguished Principals Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Distinguished Principals Program was established in 1984 as an annual event to honor exemplary elementary school principals who set the pace, character, and quality of the education children receive during their early school years. One principal is chosen from each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia, and this year Ms. Jo Price Craven has been selected as a National Distinguished Principal from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her time at Piner Elementary School, Principal Jo Price Craven has displayed herself to be an example of excellence in primary education. Her educational philosophy fosters a school environment that is considerate and challenging to allow teachers at Piner Elementary to mobilize and enhance student performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kentuckians are extremely proud of Ms. Jo Price Craven. I am honored to pay tribute to her, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing Principal Craven continued success as she continues her exceptional work in education.</paragraph>
