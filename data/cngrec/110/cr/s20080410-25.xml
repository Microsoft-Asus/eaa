  <narrative>THANKING STAFF -- (Senate - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2934">S2934</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier today the Senate passed <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. As I said during the debate, <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> is a collection of over 60 bills reported from the Committee on Energy  and Natural Resources over the past 15 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work of our outstanding staff. Both the ranking member, Senator Domenici, and I are very fortunate to have a very dedicated and experienced professional staff. They service the committee and the Senate well. They deserve our thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Democratic staff of the committee, senior counsel David Brooks had the lead role in assembling the bill. He deserves special acknowledgment. In addition, though, I want to particularly thank the committee's staff director, Bob Simon, for his wonderful work on this legislation, as on all the legislation that comes through our committee; our chief counsel, Sam Fowler, for his superb work, as always; counsels Mike Connor, Kira Finkler, and Scott Miller, and professional staff members Angela  Becker-Dimmpann, Jonathan Epstein, and Al Stayman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the committee's chief clerk, Mia Bennett; executive assistant Amanda Kelly; communications director Bill Wicker; press secretary David Marks; staff assistants Rosemarie Calabro, Rachel Pasternack, and Gina Weinstock; and our Bevinetto fellow who works on our staff, Karl Cordova.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Republican side, let me acknowledge Senator Domenici's staff director, Frank Macchiarola, who did an excellent job here; his chief counsel, Judy Pensabene; professional staff members Kathryn Clay, Frank Gladics, Josh Johnson, and Tom Lilly; and executive assistant Kara Weishaar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I am very grateful to the committee's nondesignated staff: AnnaKristina Fox, Dawson Foard, Nancy Hall, Amber Passmore, Monica Chestnut, and Wanda Green.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me acknowledge the great help in bringing the bill to the floor we received from the majority leader and his staff: Neil Kornze, Chris Miller, Randy DeValk, Gary Myrick, and, as always, the secretary for the majority, Lula Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these fine staff members had a hand in putting <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> together and moving it through the legislative process. We would not have been able to pass the bill without their hard work and their professionalism. I wish to thank each and every one of them for the good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know the Senator from Colorado is here to speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Colorado.</chair>
