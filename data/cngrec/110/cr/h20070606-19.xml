    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during my career as a heart surgeon, I saw too many patients who were trapped in a paper-based system that leads to duplicative tests and avoidable medical errors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the advancement of innovative health information technology, America's health care system remains trapped in the 20th century. The need for health IT became even more apparent during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, when I saw displaced patients present themselves in makeshift clinics with little or no medical history to guide their health providers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, only 24 percent of Louisiana physicians have converted their offices to electronic health records because many are unwilling or unable to handle the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will soon introduce a bill to create a demonstration project through the Department of Health and Human Services to provide financial incentives to providers and health information exchange networks to encourage the adoption and use of interactive personal health records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health IT will greatly improve the quality of information and care that patients receive, but Congress should do more to encourage physicians to transfer to a paperless system.</paragraph>
