    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join my colleague from Virginia, Senator Webb, in recognition of the 100th birthday of an exceptional American, Oliver White Hill. I am proud to say that this champion of civil rights is a fellow Virginian whom I have come to know personally over these many years. It is my privilege today to join Senator Webb in honor of this great man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After earning his law degree from Howard University School of Law where, I might add, he finished as the salutatorian to none other than future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall--Oliver White Hill began his law practice in Roanoke, VA, moving soon thereafter to Richmond to serve the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, as the leader of its legal team in our Commonwealth. In his work with the NAACP from 1940 to 1961, Mr. Hill contributed tremendously to the  progression of civil rights in our country, particularly in his role as a principal attorney on the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working diligently for the NAACP, Mr. Hill was legal counsel for many historic cases regarding equal opportunity in education, employment, housing, transportation, and justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a person who has spent many years in public service, I have a special appreciation for the dignity with which Mr. Hill answered the call to duty throughout his career, first as a veteran of World War II, as the first African American elected to the Richmond City Council since the Reconstruction era, and later as a Federal appointee to the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my honor today to stand before the Senate in appreciation for the efforts of Mr. Hill on behalf of his country and his Commonwealth. Certainly, the legacy of his strong career in support of equal rights will continue to be felt through the determination of the many Americans mentored or inspired by Oliver White Hill, and I join with Senator Webb in gratitude for his dedication and longevity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues a Senate resolution that I have cosponsored with my esteemed colleague, the senior senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my home State celebrates its 400th anniversary, this resolution recognizes one of Virginia's most esteemed citizens, as he is preparing to celebrate an important milestone of his own. Oliver White Hill, a pioneer in the field of American Civil Rights law, will soon celebrate his 100th birthday at a gathering of hundreds of his friends, family and other admirers in Richmond, VA. I am honored to be counted among the list of guests, and it is with immense pride and an even greater sense of humility  that I filed this resolution honoring the life and work of Mr. Hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oliver Hill was born on May 1, 1907 in Richmond, and his family later moved to Roanoke, VA, and then Washington, DC, where he graduated from Dunbar High School. After leaving Dunbar, Mr. Hill enrolled at Howard University, earning both an undergraduate and law degree from that fine institution. As a testament to his brilliance, he graduated second in his class, a group whose valedictorian was none other than legal giant and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although much of America was racially segregated, Mr. Hill nonetheless became a member of the Virginia Bar in 1934, and began his law practice in Roanoke. He later moved to Richmond and began a remarkable tenure leading the Virginia legal team of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from 1940 to 1961. Often forgoing lucrative legal work in pursuit of equal rights under the law for African Americans, Mr. Hill worked as one the principal attorneys on the historic Brown  vs. Board of Education case in 1954. His dedication to this nation was further demonstrated when, in the midst of World War II, Mr. Hill interrupted his private law practice to serve in the Armed Forces from 1943 to 1945.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hill was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to a committee to study racism in the United States. In 1948, Mr. Hill made history as the first African-American elected to Richmond's City Council since the days of Reconstruction. His public service career also included stints at the Federal Housing Administration and at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during that agency's early days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Mr. Hill acted as legal counsel in numerous landmark civil rights cases. His work encompasses equal opportunity in education,  employment, housing, transportation, and the justice system. Mr. Hill's age has not deterred him from continuing to actively engage in civic activities throughout the United States and the world. He has been received countless awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President William Jefferson  Clinton in 1999, the prestigious Spingarn Medal from the NAACP in 2005, the dedication of a building in his honor on the grounds of the Virginia State Capitol in 2005 and professional accolades too numerous to count. Oliver Hill is living history, and an American of the finest order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generations of attorneys, activists and public servants, including myself, have been inspired and mentored by Oliver Hill. In recognition of his outstanding service to our country advancing the cause of freedom for all Americans, I am proud to have submitted this resolution in his honor on the occasion of his 100th birthday.</paragraph>
