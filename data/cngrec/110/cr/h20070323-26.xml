    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, ever since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have been telling the American people they should immediately report suspicious activities. This important step is one of the best ways we have to stop terrorism. Sadly, last week, Americans who were simply trying to protect themselves in their country have now found themselves subject to a lawsuit for reporting suspicious activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a lawsuit filed against US Airways, 60 moms removed from planes in Minneapolis have named "John Does" as defendants. These are simply people who were watching suspicious activities and called to report those suspicious activities, and now they are going to be terrorized in our court system in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think that that is unconscionable, and so I am presenting the Protecting Americans Fighting Terrorism Act to keep people safe who report suspicious activity in this country to law enforcement officials to protect the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important measure to help us be able to police ourselves and report suspicious activity.</paragraph>
