  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the Second Congressional District of South Carolina will lose an important public servant. Tia Williams is departing the Washington office to be in graduate school at the University of Virginia where she will seek a master's degree in urban and environmental planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tia has served as staff assistant to the Second District since March 2006. Many South Carolinians have come to know her, as she was vital in arranging tours for Palmetto State families visiting Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of South Congaree, Tia is the daughter of Marty and Angie Williams and the sister of Taylor Williams. She is a graduate of Clemson University and Airport High School of West Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Tia's dedication to the people of the Second District. I know she will apply the same dedication to her studies at UVA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11. All Americans should read the Lieberman op-ed in today's Washington Post.</paragraph>
