    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Rabbi Felipe Goodman to the United States Congress. His credentials are as impressive as his spirit and his commitment. I know because not only is he my rabbi, he's my close personal friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Mexico City, he is an alumni of Mexico City's University of the New World and obtained his master's degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary. Ordained in 1996, Rabbi Goodman now leads one of the most vibrant and fastest-growing conservative congregations in the United States, Temple Beth Sholom in my hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his 10 years of service, his congregation has grown from 100 to more than 700 families. He has built an entire new campus and is building a new home for its thriving school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 5, 2007, 1 day after his 40th birthday, Rabbi Goodman became a United States citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rabbi Goodman is the co-author of "Hagadah de Pesaj," which is the most widely used edition of The Pesach Hagadah used in Latin America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Singled-out by international leaders for both his ideas and hard work, Felipe became vice president of the World Union of Jewish Students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is one of 12 members of The Rabbinic Cabinet of The Chancellor of The Jewish Theological Seminary and serves as a member of The Joint Placement Commission of The Rabbinical Assembly, The United Synagogue and JTS. The Seminary recently appointed him to the Joint Retirement Board of The Conservative Movement. He's a former member of The Executive Council of The Rabbinical Assembly and its Nominating Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more than any degree or honor or appointment, he is an important, warm, caring, and respected spiritual and religious leader in Las Vegas, Nevada, a devoted husband to Liz; a wonderful father to Yoshua, Daniela, and Ariela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have him here with us in the House today and honored to call Rabbi Felipe Goodman my rabbi and my friend.</paragraph>
