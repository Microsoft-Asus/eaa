    <paragraph>Mr. President, Saturday, April 28, is Workers Memorial Day. Tomorrow, working men and women around the world will gather to remember their millions of brothers and sisters who have been injured or killed on the job. I join them in their grief-and in their determination to secure a safer future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Work-related accidents kill Americans with a regularity that calls us to question the very word "accident." Fifteen deaths every day, and more than 11,000 injuries: They are grimly predictable and often preventable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is for men like Eleazar Torres-Gomez, a laundry worker who was dragged by a conveyor belt into a 300-degree industrial dryer, where he burned to death. Sadness at his death is matched by an equal anger-especially when we learn that, in the two years preceding it, his employer was cited more than 170 times for unsafe, illegal working conditions. We remember Eleazar today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is for the 12 miners killed last year in Sago, West Virginia, when an explosion trapped them underground for two days. Only a few years before, the Mine Safety and Health Administration struck down 17 new safety rules for trapped miners--rules that might have saved the miners in Sago. We remember them today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is for the 28 union construction workers killed in Connecticut, 20 years ago this month, when the apartment towers they were building collapsed with a roar, within seconds, into ruined concrete and steel. In the wake of their deaths, we outlawed the dangerous lift-slab construction method that led to the collapse. But we can never replace those lives; today we remember them, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we honor them? I know this much: Words alone would be an insult. The men and women we remember this Saturday risked their lives so we could lie down and wake up in health and safety and comfort, and merely speaking our gratitude would be emptier than doing nothing. We owe them action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe them action equal to the historic Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), which was passed 37 years ago tomorrow and has saved an estimated 350,000 lives. We need to cover more workers--because more than 8.5 million are not protected by OSHA. We need more resources for inspection and enforcement--because, at the current rate, federal inspectors are only able to examine workplaces, on average, once every 133 years. We need stiffer penalties for employers who knowingly put their workers'  lives at risk--because employers like those who compromised Mr. Torres-Gomez's life now face a maximum penalty of a simple misdemeanor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we need the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to take its work more seriously--because, according to a New York Times report released this week, "the agency has killed dozens of existing and proposed regulations and delayed adopting others."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taking these vital steps for workers adds up to more than increased resources or stronger oversight--ultimately, it translates to respect. We owe their memories nothing less. Five thousand seven hundred workers were killed on the job last year, and our economic prosperity is built on their flesh and blood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than half a century ago, George Orwell remarked on the disregard that so often greets manual labor: "It keeps us alive, and we are oblivious of its existence....... We are capable of forgetting it as we forget the blood in our veins."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we pledge ourselves as the exception to that rule. And if we mean our words, we will be the exception tomorrow, and the day after that. For America's working men and women deserve nothing less than our eternal gratitude and diligence in preventing future workplace tragedies.</paragraph>
