  <narrative>OFFICERS SAY IRAQ WAR HAS STRETCHED MILITARY "DANGEROUSLY THIN" -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1159]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 5 years after the start of the war in Iraq, a new authoritative poll shows the growing concern of U.S. military officers about the impact of the war in Iraq on our Nation's security. The poll is based on the opinions of 3,400 present and former military officers. Eighty-eight percent of these officers believe that the demands of the Iraq war have "stretched the U.S. military dangerously thin." Eighty percent of the military officers believe it is unreasonable  to expect that the U.S. could respond to any new military threat in another part of the world. And nearly three-quarters of the officers believe civilian leaders set "unreasonable goals for the military in post-Saddam Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, the Bush administration is not listening to its own military officers. In fact, before the start of the Iraq war, not one single military officer believed that Iraq had anything to do with the war on terrorism. And yet President Bush is determined to continue this war irregardless of his military's own concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has undermined our Nation's military strength and our readiness and, therefore, our national security.</paragraph>
