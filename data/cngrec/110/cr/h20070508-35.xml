  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today's headline in Guam reads, "Island in state of mourning." This is because Guam has lost its 10th son to the war in Iraq. The headline could read the same after yesterday's call for a recorded vote by the Republican leadership on <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Act, a bipartisan bill giving parity to Guam after 63 years of inequity and injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question we must ask ourselves before this vote today is, will we ignore history? Will we be deaf to the testimonials of Guam's liberators, our U.S. servicemen, who spoke about Guam's patriotism in the face of enemy occupation? Will we vote against inequity for people who aided our military to take Guam back from the enemy, who greeted our military with tattered rags made into American flags?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A vote against <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill> is one against patriotic Americans. I urge my colleagues to support the Guam World War II Loyalty Act.</paragraph>
