  <narrative>FISA -- (Senate - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4590">S4590</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Finally, I wish to briefly turn to FISA. This Congress has been working on FISA modernization for over 400 days with apparently no end in sight. Should it take this long? The Constitution of the United States was written in about 115 days. That included travel time on horseback for the Founding Fathers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has had plenty of time to debate this issue. We have to make sure we do not create unnecessary obstacles for intelligence analysts to track terrorists. As has been said, they can't connect the dots if they can't collect the dots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While negotiations continue, it is important to look at the two bills that have passed the Chambers. Let me paint a picture, a Tale of Two Bills, if you will. One bill was available for the public to review for over 4 months, went through 2 committees, had 2 weeks of floor debate including votes on 13 amendments, and passed the Chamber with a huge bipartisan veto-proof majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other bill was available for review for 2 days before receiving a vote. It went through no committees, had 1 hour of floor debate, allowed no amendments, and failed to receive bipartisan support, while barely passing the Chamber. Any negotiator would say the first bill in this instance would be the basis for negotiation, not the other way around. I am sure it is no surprise to anyone that the first one I described is the Senate-passed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, I will not support any compromise that disregards the extensive work of the Senate in order to facilitate a quick political fix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate those who are standing tall on the FISA bill in both Houses. I hope we continue to do so because our very country is in jeopardy if we do not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I wish to personally pay tribute and give my gratitude and thanks to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for his kindness in allowing me to make these remarks out of turn because they are important remarks. I would feel badly if I didn't get on the floor and make these remarks. It was a very gracious thing for him to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my colleague, Senator Hatch. He is always gracious. I also thank him for his words on Senator Kennedy because we know they have shared a close association in the Chamber for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank him for his leadership on child pornography. It is pretty sick, some of the things that go on. It is almost hard to believe. I saw the slide the Senator from Utah showed about activity on just 1 day of this year, earlier this month. It is almost hard to comprehend. We thank him for his leadership there as well.</paragraph>
