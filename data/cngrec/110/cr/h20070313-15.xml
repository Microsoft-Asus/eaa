  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a fundamental part of human nature that people will do high-quality work when somebody is keeping an eye on their performance. Businesses need accountants, schools need principals and school boards. Appropriate management and a vigilant watchdog can prevent serious problems and keep things running effectively and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, for 6 years our Federal Government has gone without congressional oversight. This administration has had free rein to do what it pleased, no matter what the consequences. The results simply speak for themselves, Walter Reed, Hurricane Katrina, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is all beginning to change. Under Democratic control, the Congress has finally once again assumed its oversight responsibility. Already, in just 3 months we have had 91 full committee hearings, with 73 more planned. In addition, this week the House will consider a series of measures to ensure the Federal Government is open and accountable to the people of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this congressional oversight is exactly what the people of southern Minnesota asked for, transparent and accountable government for the people. As I campaigned across the First District, I promised to do everything with my colleagues to make this happen, and this week it continues on.</paragraph>
