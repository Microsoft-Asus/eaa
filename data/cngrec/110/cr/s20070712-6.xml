  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there will be a period of morning business. Once that is closed, the Senate will resume the Defense authorization bill at which time an amendment from the Republican side is expected to be offered. Once we have disposed of the Republican amendment, the next first-degree amendment from the majority side will be the wounded warriors amendment to be offered by Chairman Levin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have met with my staff this morning, and they have been meeting with Republican staff on the committee. I have spoken to Senator Warner and Senator McCain. We want this bill to have a full airing. We want people to have the opportunity to offer amendments. We are going to try to work our way through the procedural morass we find when we have a complicated bill, but we hope when we complete this legislation next week, people will feel they have had an opportunity to offer amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know there are a number of issues relating to Iraq. We want to try to get those up and disposed of. There are some other amendments I know people want to offer, nonrelated amendments, but I hope we can hold back from doing that. We should keep this bill one related to defense. I hope we can do that. There will be other opportunities, as we proceed through legislation, to offer some of the important nonrelated matters.</paragraph>
