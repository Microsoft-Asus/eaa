    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize Wells Fargo for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects their hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role they have played in giving back to their local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wells Fargo works with Habitat for Humanity of South Dakota. Wells Fargo has distributed donations to Habitat for Humanity affiliates across South Dakota. These generous donations have exceeded $883,000. Wells Fargo employees have been a major asset to Habitat for Humanity of South Dakota by volunteering 16,000 hours of labor in the construction of 33 homes across the state. Wells Fargo's financial and volunteer support has allowed Habitat for Humanity to substantially expand its work throughout  South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Wells Fargo and to congratulate them on receiving this well-earned award and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
