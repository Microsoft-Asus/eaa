  <narrative>NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12486]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that I come after the gentleman from Missouri, because before leaving home down in South Carolina this morning, I went to dedicate a water project in a part of my State where they have a real problem with potable water, and extensive health problems as well. During that ceremony, it was asked of me what kind of guarantee that I have that this water project would be seen to fruition. This morning we were dedicating the first phase. There are two others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In answering the question, I referred to the greatest of all books, the Bible. I referred to the Book of Hebrew, the 11th chapter. I call that the faith chapter of the Bible. I quoted Hebrew 11.1: Faith, the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things unseen. I quoted that because in our work here, much of the time, though we don't view our work as being grounded in the Bible, we often strike out on faith. We have a little idea sometimes of exactly where any issue is going. I do  believe that as we carry out our duties and responsibilities to the people of this great Nation, sometimes we ought to pause and give credence to where that emanates from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am pleased that my good friend from Illinois asked me to come down tonight and to join in this special order commemorating the Bible during National Bible Week. When I was growing up, my father, who was a fundamentalist minister, never asked me to read the Bible, never instructed me to do so. He just told me every morning at the breakfast table to recite a Bible verse. Now, it would be a little difficult to do that without reading the Bible. He made sure that we didn't do the same one twice.  Daddy set down the rule. He took Jesus' whip off the table. So it was very, very important for me to read the Bible daily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also had a second rule, and that is that every night before retiring to bed, we had to share with our parents, or one of them, some current event. He would often have ways of showing us how that particular event that we may have shared was grounded in the Good Book.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So long before I became House Majority Whip, I assumed the leadership of the Democrats' Faith Working Group. For the last 3 years now, Mr. Speaker, it has been my great joy to work with the members of our caucus, trying to get our membership comfortable with the fact that our work here is in fact faith-based.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you doubt it, then I ask all of my colleagues to just take a look at my favorite book of the Bible, the Book of James. It has got nothing to do with my name, though that would not be a bad thing. It's a very short book, but it tells us a lot about our responsibility. There, in the second chapter of James, we are all instructed that if your brother or sister comes to you hungry and naked, it is not enough to tell them to go in faith; you feed them and you clothe them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this Congress is all about. This Congress is about doing those things that are necessary to make sure that our constituents and make sure that our citizens are fed that need to be fed or clothed that need to be clothed. I do believe if James were writing his epistle today, he would also tell us it is also important to house them when they need shelter.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this year the week of November 18-24th has been designated "National Bible Week," a week to renew our interest in the Bible and to recognize the influence that the Bible has had in our lives and on our nation throughout its history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a child growing up in West Virginia, I was encouraged by my father to read the Bible daily, because he found such solace and comfort in the Word. As Paul wrote in Philippians 4:13, "I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want, I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Knowing this soothes and comforts my soul in times of distress. It is my guiding light that keeps me centered and focused and I derive great joy from reading the scriptures during my time of mediation and reflection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, God's Word written in the Holy Scriptures of the Bible is important to me both as an individual and as a leader. It is the Bible that guides me through the day, as I seek to make decisions that will affect people in my state and in our nation--decisions that require a wisdom that is found throughout the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the Word of God written in the Bible that gives me the fortitude I need to carry out my responsibilities as a friend, a father, a husband, and a Congressman. The Bible provides the wisdom to know how to respond to my family and constituents during times of dire crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, and many more, I thank God that we have a manual for our daily living in the Bible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we face the unforeseen challenges that lie ahead, both at home and abroad, I encourage all Americans to read the Bible and read it often, to study its teachings, and to make it an important part of their lives.</paragraph>
