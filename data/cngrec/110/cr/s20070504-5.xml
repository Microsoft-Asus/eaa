    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business today. There are no rollcall votes. Yesterday, cloture was filed on the substitute amendment to <bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill>, the FDA bill, and cloture was filed on the bill. In addition, cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act. Votes will begin Monday at about 4 p.m., and there will be several votes at that time. We are disappointed we were not able to finish FDA yesterday, as anticipated.  I am confident we can finish it Monday night or Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot to do next week. As I have indicated, I am going to move to the immigration bill on Wednesday so debate on that can start on the following Monday. We also have the opportunity to complete our budget for the year. I have spoken to Senator Conrad on a number of occasions. I have spoken to the Speaker on this issue. It is very close to being in a position that we can bring it to the floor. It is my understanding the House will appoint conferees on Monday, and we will do that  on the next day. It is a privileged motion. There is 10 hours of debate, and there are some procedural issues dealing with motions to instruct. We will find out how many there will be on either side. That will take up a lot of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The WRDA bill is extremely important. It passed overwhelmingly in the House. I hope we can do the same here.</paragraph>
