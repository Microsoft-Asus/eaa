    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize Janet Turcotte, of Bowie, MD, for her courageous efforts to raise awareness of colon cancer and promote screening. Janet was first diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer 4 years ago at age 53, and she is currently battling her third recurrence of the disease. I met Janet in March when she came to my office on behalf of C3, the Colorectal Cancer Coalition. C3 is a national organization whose mission is to eliminate suffering and death  due to colorectal cancer. Janet has joined the coalition in its push for "more research to improve screening, diagnosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer; for policy decisions that make the most effective colorectal cancer prevention and treatment available for all; and for increased awareness that colorectal cancer is preventable, treatable, and beatable."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Janet Turcotte brought her fight against colorectal cancer to a new venue, the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. The Preakness is the second and shortest leg of horse racing's prestigious Triple Crown, being preceded by the Kentucky Derby and followed by the Belmont Stakes. The race was inaugurated in 1873 for 3 year-old thoroughbreds, and its l32nd running will be held this coming Saturday, May 19 in Baltimore, MD. Janet has embroidered the saddlecloths for thoroughbreds at  the annual race for over 2 decades. Last May, she added the colorectal cancer "Blue Star of Hope" to the saddlecloths of the 11 contenders. Pimlico Race Course will again support Janet's efforts to fight colorectal cancer this coming weekend. More than 17 million people will view this weekend's race and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Janet's message is an urgent and important one. In 2006 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 150,000 new cases were diagnosed and more than 50,000 Americans died from colon cancer. In my own State of Maryland, nearly 1,000 people lost their lives to this disease last year. What many people are not as aware of is that colon, cancer is preventable with appropriate screening, highly detectable, and curable if found early.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past April, I introduced the Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act of 2007 along with my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Graham. This bill would help eliminate the barriers that currently exist under Medicare for colorectal cancer screening and increase the number of seniors who receive this potentially lifesaving benefit. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if everyone age 50 and older were screened regularly, as  many as 60 percent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented. When colorectal cancer is found early and treated, the 5-year survival rate is greater than 90 percent. With the number of lives at stake, the efforts of Janet Turcotte and other brave survivors deserve special recognition. As Janet has</paragraph>
