  <narrative>NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO PROCEEDING ON OCTOBER 2, 2007 -- (Senate - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12561">S12561</bill>]</narrative>
  <narrative>Mrs. FEINSTEIN, pursuant to the provisions of section 512 of Public Law 110-181, submitted her notice of intent to object to proceed to consider the bill (<bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>) to require Senate candidates to file designations, statements, and reports in electronic form, dated Oct. 2, 2007, for the following reasons:</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. President, I objected to Senator Ensign's proposed unanimous consent of September 27, 2007, to take up and vote on an amendment to <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act, which is not germane to the underlying bill and has not been reviewed by the Rules and Administration Committee. The proposed Ensign amendment would require outside groups, such as advocacy and charitable organizations, that file ethics complaints to disclose their donors. His proposal to require limited  debate and then a vote on the amendment before voting on <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill> could be prevent the timely passage of the underlying bill before the 2008 election.</narrative>
  <narrative>Next year's presidential and congressional elections are expected to have record contributions to and expenditures by candidates for federal offices. Electronic filing by Senate candidates will provide timely reports of these activities. I believe the subject matter of the Ensign amendment would be best addressed first in the Rules Committee, where a hearing will provide an opportunity for all interested parties to express their views on this matter.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated October 2, 2007, to me from Senator Feinstein.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>RULES AND ADMINISTRATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, October 2, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR REID: As you know, under the provisions of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (section 512 of P.L. 110-81), a Senator is required to submit a "Notice of Intent to Object" letter when another Senator objects to a unanimous consent request on his/her behalf. Please consider this letter as my notice of intent to object for Senator Baucus's objection, on my behalf, to Senator Ensign's proposed amendment to <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act,  on September 27, 2007. On that date, Senator Ensign asked unanimous consent to proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 96, <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act, only if an unrelated and potentially controversial amendment that he proposed is also brought up for a vote.</narrative>
  <narrative>As you know, the underlying bill--S. 223--requires Senate candidates to file designations, statements and reports in electronic form, rather than paper. Forty-one Senators have signed onto this long overdue bill. When Senator Feingold, the bill's principal sponsor, and I sought unanimous consent to take up and adopt this bill on September 24, Senator Ensign objected, saying he would continue his hold on the bill unless we agreed to a vote on his proposal to have outside groups, such as advocacy  and charitable organizations that file ethics complaints disclose their donors. This unfortunate delay followed two earlier occasions in April when Senator Feingold and I sought unanimous consent for passage of <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill> and the Minority placed holds on that effort.</narrative>
  <narrative>While <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill> has had a full hearing in the Senate Rules and Administration Committee and has widespread support, Senator Ensign's amendment has not been reviewed by either the Rules Committee or the Finance Committee, which also may have concerns about its impact on nonprofit organizations. On September 27, Senator Baucus objected to Senator Ensign's proposed amendment on my behalf. And while I have taken no position on the merits of Senator Ensign's amendment, I believe it is non-germane to  the underlying bill and it could be a poison pill that will prevent the timely passage of <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill> before the 2008 election.</narrative>
  <narrative>Next year's presidential and congressional elections are expected to have record contributions to and expenditures by candidates for federal offices. Electronic filing by Senate candidates will provide timely reports of these activities.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Dianne Feinstein,</narrative>
