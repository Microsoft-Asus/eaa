  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to be able to move through this PEPFAR legislation. It would be good for our country if we pass it. I also have spoken to the Speaker. She agrees with me and Senator McConnell that we should move this housing fix quickly. The President and his people have submitted to us some language that we think, from all we can tell, is appropriate. Senator Dodd is agreeing we should move forward. I think there is a sense we should do this within the  next couple of days. This is something that is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the housing crisis, the main reason we do this is to make sure people understand that we have faith in our financial markets. Fannie and Freddie, we believe, with the attention being focused on them over the weekend and today, have stabilized, and that is the way it should be. We are going to try to move forward on this very quickly.</paragraph>
