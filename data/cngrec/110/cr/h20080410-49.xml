  <narrative>SANCTUARY CITY SAN FRANCISCO -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2212]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400394" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, some in the most radical elements of the pro-illegal immigration groups advocate something called "Reconquista," or that is to say, they want to have that part of the United States that was ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. They want to have it voided, and either that chunk of America returned to Mexico or become a second nation. I mean, it's pretty bizarre, but that's what they push for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes I hear some of the things said by some of the officials in San Francisco. And I would suggest that if advocates for this Reconquista would agree to take San Francisco first, I might be sympathetic to their particular point of view. Because some of the things that are done, some of the statements that are made are quite bizarre, to say the least, and would indicate a lack of willingness on the part of its citizens, or at least expressed by some of its public officials, a lack of willingness  to adhere to the laws of this United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The San Francisco Chronicle reported recently that Mayor Gavin Newsom announced a new initiative advertising his city as a sanctuary for illegal aliens. According to this report, San Francisco plans to spend $83,000 to print brochures in half a dozen languages reassuring illegal aliens that they are welcome to stay and access public services. He went on to declare that, we don't care what your status is, we want you to participate in the life of our city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes without saying that this is dangerous policy, and it makes no sense in a post 9/11 environment. It's also a flagrant violation of Federal law. In 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed immigration enforcement legislation making policies like San Francisco's that provide sanctuary to illegal aliens and potential terrorists by refusing to report them to Federal authorities, making that action illegal, as I say. But unfortunately for America, the Bush Administration doesn't seem  to care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dozens of major cities have enacted these kinds of reckless policies, barring law enforcement personnel from cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement efforts, and with disastrous results I might add. In Denver, a sanctuary city, a police officer was shot and killed and a second officer critically wounded on Mother's Day of 2005 by an illegal alien who was later arrested. He had been stopped twice for driving without a license and had to appear in municipal court twice. In April, less  than one month before the shooting, the man was in court with a Mexican driver's license, yet no one asked him about his immigration status because of Denver's sanctuary city policy. If the perpetrator had been deported in April, that police officer might still be alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This tragic case is just one example, and there are countless others. These policies are responsible for thousands of major crimes around our country, and could have been prevented. These irresponsible city leaders gamble not only with the safety of their own residents, but with the residents of neighboring communities and the entire United States as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the American people have demanded an end to these dangerous policies, and Congress has responded by passing legislation to outlaw them. So the question is, will President Bush allow this rogue mayor to put the rest of the country at risk, or will he finally live up to his oath of office and enforce the law?</paragraph>
