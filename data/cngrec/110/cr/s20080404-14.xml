    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am here today to honor the University of Iowa wrestling team. The Hawkeye wrestlers won their 21st NCAA championship on March 22, 2008 in St. Louis. It was the first national championship for the Hawkeyes since 2000, and it shows that Iowa's great wrestling tradition continues. Under the tutelage of former Hawkeye great Tom Brands, the Iowa squad won its 32nd Big Ten conference title with a perfect 8-0 record. They had an overall dual record of 21-1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa crowned two individual national champions in St. Louis, Brent Metcalf and Mark Perry. Metcalf had an incredible season for the black and gold and was named Outstanding Wrestler at the Big Ten and NCAA Championships, and at the Division I NWCA/Cliff Keen National Duals. Metcalf was named Big Ten Wrestler of the Year, and most recently was awarded the Dan Hodge Trophy which recognizes the top college wrestler each year. Perry won the second national championship of his college career. He was  also named an All-American for the fourth time. A senior, Perry compiled an overall record of 96-16, and a 20-3 record this season. They also had seven athletes named All-Americans, Metcalf, Perry, Jay Borschel, Matt Fields, Charlie Falck, Phillip Keddy and Joe Slaton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Brands was named National Wrestling Coaches Association Coach of the Year and Big Ten Coach of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowans also celebrated the Hawkeyes' success on April 3, which Governor Culver proclaimed "University of Iowa Wrestling Day" in our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to recognize the Iowa Hawkeye wrestling team, along with Coach Tom Brands and his outstanding staff, for winning the Division I Wrestling National Team Championship.</paragraph>
