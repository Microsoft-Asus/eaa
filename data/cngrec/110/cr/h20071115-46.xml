    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to join with all the others who have spoken tonight about Dean Aguillen and his service to this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten years is a long time. It's no surprise that Dean rose through the ranks and was counted on by so many. I got to know him, as you've heard, in those early days. We were elected last November. We came in here, and it was like drinking out of a firehose, trying to absorb everything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And everywhere we turned, Dean, you were there as a calming influence and continued in that role over time in the Chamber, in the hallways, on the phone, always a resource when we needed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish you the very best. I know you go on to great things, whatever you choose to pursue. I know you will be taking with you a tremendous amount of knowledge and expertise and skills away from this Chamber. But I also know that you've shared it with so many that the benefits of what you brought to this Chamber will continue for years and years to come. So congratulations on your service.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
