    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life of C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez, to commemorate his life, to ask for a national holiday. He would have been 80 years old this Saturday, and I guess the most personal thing I can say is how he affected my life and the lives of countless people. He gave voice to the powerless in this country. He gave voice to the issues of the environment, human rights, labor rights, education and turned a whole generation and a whole community to look forward  to opportunity and to stand up and protect the very fundamental rights that each one of us as an American holds true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez is not just an icon. C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez is a living legacy of what this country's unfinished business is, the unfinished business of giving worth to each human being in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would end with a quote by C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez: "We can choose to use our lives for others to bring about a better and more just world for our children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the greatest opportunity we have.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
