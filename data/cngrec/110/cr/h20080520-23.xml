  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for 501 days liberal Democrats have controlled Congress. And these liberal Democrats, including the Speaker, continue to talk about their secret solution for skyrocketing gas prices. But they have failed to produce any answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Empty rhetoric and broken promises will not lower the price at the pump for American families. The people in my district in Southwest Louisiana understand that and they want real solutions. They want a comprehensive energy policy that allows us to strategically manage our fossil fuel dependence while we then transition and invest in alternative fuels. They don't want an energy policy that's held hostage to radical environmentalism. They want an energy policy that will increase responsible American  energy production and refining capacity. They want to unleash American ingenuity and entrepreneurship. They don't want delays. They want a comprehensive energy policy because it's in the interest of our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families in Southwest Louisiana and across the country are looking for solutions to the price at the pump, they're looking for solutions for health care costs, and they're looking for solutions to the housing slowdown. Republicans have viable answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are asking the Democratic leadership in Washington if they have solutions, we haven't seen any. Bring them forward. Let's work together to ease the price at the pump and to decrease America's dependence on foreign sources of oil.</paragraph>
