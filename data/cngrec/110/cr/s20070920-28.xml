  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I have a heavy heart. It is with great regret that I share with the Senate that the Honorable H. Emory Widener, Jr.--one of our country's extraordinary jurists, an exceptional Virginian, and a good friend--has passed away. For 38 years, he served our Nation and Virginia as a member of the Federal judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has lost one of its finest jurists, someone who was universally admired for his dedication to the Constitution, to the laws passed by the Congress and subsequently enacted, and to the impartial treatment of those who appeared before him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emory Widener started his career in public service by entering the Naval Academy in Annapolis. Responding to the call of duty, he served as an officer in the final year of World War II. He later served in the Korean war and received an honorable discharge in 1958. Following 2 years in the Naval Reserves, he began law school at Washington and Lee University, and upon graduation he returned to that region of Virginia which he loved so dearly, southwest Virginia, to enter private practice in Bristol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1969, Emory Widener was nominated for a lifetime appointment to the Federal court as a U.S. district judge for the Western District of Virginia and was promptly confirmed by the Senate. After an unusually brief period of time, only 2 years, he became the chief judge of this Federal court. In 1972, he was nominated for a seat on the Fourth Circuit and again received an expedient confirmation by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By his extraordinarily well written opinions, Judge Widener became a legend on the Fourth Circuit. Judge Widener's exemplary judgment and integrity were profound assets to this important court, and I always have had a deep admiration and respect for this magnificent man and jurist. He was a legal giant in Virginia, a legal giant in America's Federal courts, and his service as a jurist should be a model for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without question, southwest Virginia has lost one of its dearest friends. Yet the region can everlastingly point with great pride and admiration to the achievements of one of its greatest sons. He will be missed not only in Abingdon, VA, where his kept his office, but also by he fellow jurists, those who practiced before him, and throughout the Commonwealth and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all join in extending our deepest sympathies to his family and his friends as they mourn his passing.</paragraph>
