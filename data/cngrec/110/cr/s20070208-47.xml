    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to express my gratitude to Richard H. Shapiro for 18 years of service to the Congress in his capacities as program director and executive director of the Congressional Management Foundation, CMF. As he enters retirement, I wish the best for Richard and his family. They should know that the contributions he made during his tenure at the CMF have had positive impacts, direct or indirect, on the way every office in the Congress is managed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick started working for the Congress in the late 1970s, when he was  hired as a staff investigator for what was then the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Following the completion of his graduate education in public administration at Princeton, Rick returned to the House of Representatives as staff director for a number of subcommittees. His work in the Congress and as a management consultant in the private sector helped Rick develop a  sense of the importance of effective management to the oversight responsibilities of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his work at the CMF, Rick has helped the organization mature from a small and little known nonprofit into an established and highly used resource for congressional offices. Over the past 18 years, the CMF has doubled the size of its staff and quadrupled the size of its budget. More importantly, under Rick's leadership, the CMF has greatly increased the variety of services it offers to Member offices and committees. The CMF has prepared books specifically tailored to address management  issues faced by congressional staff members; it provides confidential consulting services to offices struggling with problems of organization, operations, and performance. Lastly, the CMF has also increased the variety of training programs it offers to senior congressional staff members on topics as varied as strategic planning and interoffice communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Rick for all his years of service to Congress. During his career, he dedicated himself to improving the efficiency and productivity of Congress. Rick's commitment to supporting this legislative body is unmatched and I know that Members of Congress and their staff will suffer a great loss when he retires. Rick, you have accomplished a lot during your time with us, and we are forever appreciative. Again, thank you for all of your hard work.</paragraph>
