    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is easy in the era where we look at the big numbers and the headlines in the newspaper to forget about the great acts of heroism that are going on right this very moment in Iraq and elsewhere in our world. I rise to bring to the attention of this body the heroism of Lieutenant Patrick Dowdell. He is serving with the 4th Infantry in Iraq as we speak. That is a division that has lost, unfortunately, over 135 heroic men and women. He is not the only hero in the family.  His younger brother, James, recently began service in Ladder Company 174 in East Flatbush. I hope you will join with me and all of his neighbors in Breezy Point in expressing tribute to this family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This family has one other chapter of heroism in its book. Lieutenant Kevin Dowdell, the father of both Patrick and James, was lost on September 11, a firefighter, in the World Trade Center. We join with this entire body and all of this country in commending Rose Ellen, their mother, and the acts of heroism that they are paying both here and in generations in the past. May God bless them, and God bless the United States of America.</paragraph>
