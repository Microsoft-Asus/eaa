    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the House for its consideration this legislation that's sponsored by the former chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources and current chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, Representative George Miller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides that the Port Chicago Naval Magazine Memorial be managed as a unit of the National Park System. Currently, the area is managed as an affiliated site by the National Park Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 17, 1944, 320 men, 202 of whom were African American sailors, were killed in an explosion at the Port Chicago Navy ammunition loading base in the San Francisco Bay area. This was the largest homeland disaster during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1992, Congress designated the Port Chicago Naval Magazine Memorial. The pending measure furthers that commitment by providing that the Port Chicago Naval Magazine Memorial be managed as a unit of the National Park System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge support for <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill>, and I submit the following exchange of letters for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 31, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: On October 10, 2007, the Committee on Natural Resources ordered <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill>, the "Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial Enhancement Act of 2007," to be reported. As you know, this measure contains certain provisions that are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed Services, and thus, was sequentially referred to the Committee on Armed Services by the Parliamentarian for the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Committee recognizes the importance of <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill> and the need for the legislation to move expeditiously. Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over this legislation, the Committee on Armed Services will waive further consideration of <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill>. I do so with the understanding that by waiving further consideration of the bill, the Committee does not waive any future jurisdictional claims over similar measures. In the event of a conference with the Senate on this bill, the Committee  on Armed Services reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter and a copy of the response in your Committee's report on <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill> and the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very truly yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ike Skelton,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, February 5, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your willingness to expedite floor consideration of <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill>, which provides for the administration of the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial as a unit of the National Park System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your willingness to waive rights to further consideration of <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill>, and am pleased that mutually agreed upon language was developed for this legislation. Of course, this waiver does not prejudice any further jurisdictional claims by your Committee over this legislation or similar language. Furthermore, I agree to support your request for appointment of conferees from the Committee on Armed Services if a conference is held on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the Committee's report on <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill> has already been filed, this exchange of letters will be inserted in the Congressional Record as part of the consideration of the bill on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With warm regards, I am</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nick J. Rahall II,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on <bill type="h" number="3111">H.R. 3111</bill>, and I yield myself 15 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman has adequately explained the bill. It's a good bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial Enhancement Act, a bill that ensures that the stories of Port Chicago will be preserved and that the site will be properly maintained for generations to come. This bill will increase the National Memorial's accessibility, provide additional visitor services, and help ensure long-term preservation of the site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today is the result of months of diligent and collaborative effort, for which I want to thank: Chairman NICK RAHALL of the Natural Resources Committee, and ranking member DON YOUNG; Chairman RA&#xDA;L GRIJALVA of the National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands Subcommittee, and ranking member ROB BISHOP; Chairman IKE SKELTON of the Armed Services Committee, and ranking member DUNCAN HUNTER; and the  thoughtful  and hard-working staff for the two committees, including Meghan Conklin, Dave Watkins, and David Sienicki, and my own legislative director, Ben Miller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Port Chicago memorial, which is in my district, commemorates a very important story in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The deadly munitions explosion there on the night of July 17, 1944, killed more than 300 people--the worst homefront disaster of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When sailors were ordered to resume work a few weeks later, most of them refused to return to their dangerous tasks until supervision, training, and working conditions were improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response, the Navy charged 50 men with conspiring to mutiny--all were convicted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority of the men killed while handling ordinance at Port Chicago, and all of those convicted of mutiny, were African-American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Port Chicago story was a turning point in American history. The injustice strongly influenced the Navy's move toward desegregation in 1945.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Port Chicago memorial tells that story, and I am proud to have authored the legislation designating the memorial, as I am proud to be involved in enhancing it with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At our hearing in Mr. GRIJALVA's subcommittee last fall, we heard from the National Park Service, in support of this bill; from Dr. Robert Allen, who literally wrote the book on Port Chicago and is a board member of the Friends of Port Chicago; and Mr. Eugene Sayles, who was a seaman first class at Port Chicago and helped to get injured men out of the barracks after the explosion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As they and others have said, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial tells a critical story in our civil rights and military history, and with this legislation, we are ensuring that more Americans will hear the Port Chicago story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Parks Conservation Association has also strongly supported this legislation, pointing to the "broad local and national support" for the effort, and noting that the Port Chicago memorial deserves elevation to its "rightful place as a fully-fledged unit of the National Park System."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new designation under this bill brings with it increased stature--and more importantly, the Park Service will be able to budget for the memorial's needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill provides for an interpretive center for the Memorial--this facility will allow school groups, families, and other visitors to learn about Port Chicago even if they can't access the site, which is located within the Concord Naval Weapons Station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank Chairman GRIJALVA, Chairman RAHALL, Chairman SKELTON, and their staff for helping us bring this important legislation to the floor today.</paragraph>
