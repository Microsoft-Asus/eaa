    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the glider pilots of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glider planes were lightweight aircraft without engines that were used to drop supplies and reinforcement personnel for troops and surveillance. They were very efficient, because they made no noise and could fly into the enemy areas undetected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gliders would be towed by larger planes in order to take off, but then would fly and land on their own. The glider pilots flew dangerous missions and were constantly at risk for being shot down. Glider pilots were instrumental in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, despite the fact that pilots had to improvise on landings, since no known landing strips were known to be behind enemy lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later in the war, the Germans would plant wooden poles in open fields to prevent glider pilots from landing. The U.S. Army Air Forces began training glider pilots in 1942. The program quickly grew during the war. Eventually, over 6,500 men were trained to be glider pilots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout World War II, the glider pilots flew eight successful missions. The glider pilots' first mission occurred on July 19, 1942, Operation Husky, which was called for the glider pilots to carry British airborne troops into Sicily. Despite the heavy casualties from landing at the sea, the glider pilots completed their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March of 1944, the glider pilots completed Operation Broadway in Burma. The glider pilots took the Japanese completely by surprise, carrying troops, airborne engineers and equipment by night. They seized and prepared landing strips for forthcoming transport planes and evacuated the wounded. The glider pilots accomplished this feat in 2 hours, completing a mission that would have taken 2 months by ambulance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most famous mission of the glider pilots was the Battle of Normandy. On D-Day the glider pilots participated in the largest combined airborne and seaborne invasion in history. They carried troops of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division and their equipment to landing areas behind enemy lines. Their work helped to secure victory in World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, each year we lose more and more of these courageous veterans. I believe Congress must recognize their accomplishments for the future generations of our veterans. That is why I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 42. This bill recognizes the glider pilots and the many troops who put their lives on the line to defend the ideas and the freedoms of our country. All of our glider missions were successful. Unfortunately, casualties were suffered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 20, "Silent Wings," a documentary on these great pilots, will be released. The documentary features interviews with glider pilots, Members of Congress and media icons. I will be sponsoring a viewing of this powerful film on the evening of March 20.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope you will all join me to commemorate these veterans. We must all remember and teach future generations about the sacrifices that glider pilots and all veterans made for our country. I urge my colleagues to support the glider pilots and cosponsor <bill type="hc" number="42">H. Con. Res. 42</bill>.</paragraph>
