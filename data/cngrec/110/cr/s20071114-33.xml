  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the Rapid City, SD, MEALS program as they celebrate 26 years of dedicated service to the Black Hills community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than a quarter century, the Rapid City MEALS program has provided our seniors with quality nutrition, education, community, and support services so they can live in their own homes and maintain their independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The MEALS program would not be able to perform its invaluable mission without the hard work and dedication of the many volunteers who put in countless hours serving the needs of others. These compassionate individuals are truly the backbone of the Rapid City community and I hope that their service will inspire others to lend a helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure, with the State of South Dakota, to congratulate the MEALS Program of Rapid City on this important anniversary and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
