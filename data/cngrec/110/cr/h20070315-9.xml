    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while Democrats are talking about fiscal discipline, their actions say otherwise. Time and time again, the Democrat "plan" is to chase increased spending with increased taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In less than 3 months, Democrats have called for immense new spending. Their agenda for the 110th Congress calls for throwing billions more at entitlements that are already growing at unsustainable rates. At the same time, they have not proposed a dollar of savings or a single reform--just more spending, financed by higher taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want reductions in spending, they want reforms to our overburdened and unsustained programs, and they want their elected leaders to be held accountable for the plans they put forth and the funding they approve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans have a responsible plan that balances the budget by encouraging economic growth and reforming entitlement programs--without raising taxes. Increasing the tax burden on the American people has never led to economic prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my constituents don't want to see a return of tax-and-spend politics.</paragraph>
