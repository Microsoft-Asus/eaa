    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express strong support for <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. This is excellent legislation. It contains needed reforms to strengthen the safety of our Nation's drug, device, and food supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to pay a word of compliment to my Republican colleagues and say that we have come to a compromise which I believe is satisfactory in the broad public interest and is an excellent piece of legislation. And I want to commend my friend Mr. Barton and our Republican colleagues for having worked with us well on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 11, 2007, the House passed <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments, by a bipartisan vote of 403-16. The bill was hailed by all as a strong bill that would improve the lives of Americans by ensuring that drugs and devices are reviewed in a competent and in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year the Senate passed a similar bill. Since July, bipartisan meetings have been held frequently between the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to reconcile the differences between the two bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes two very different user-fee programs, both vital to the timely approval of lifesaving drugs and devices. The legislation would significantly improve our postmarket safety programs, thereby preventing many of the drug and device injuries and deaths that occur today. It fills an important gap in therapies available to one of our most vulnerable and important patient groups: our children. Finally, I note that the period of market exclusivity in the pediatric studies remains 6  months, as in current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank all the members of the committee who have worked hard on this bill. They have endured long hours to ensure that this bill would be completed before the expiration of the two user-fee programs at the end of this month. And I want to pay particular tribute to the staff on both sides for their outstanding labors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that if this bill does not pass in the time limits which are imposed upon us by the September 30 expiration of this statute, we will have significant problems here that we may not be able to address because, I would point out, that failure to do so will leave us with a situation where we are going to find that RIF notices will be going out at Food and Drug and the ability to approve new drugs will all of a sudden come to a screeching and unfortunate halt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I urge my friends and colleagues to support this legislation; it is a good piece of legislation, it has the support of all who have worked with it, and I would commend it to the attention and the kindness of my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. BARTON of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, most of us are too young to remember, but in the early days of the movies there was a series of movies based on the "Perils of Pauline." Pauline was a heroine who always got tied to the railroad track, and just as the train was bearing down on her the hero would come out and rescue her for another adventure in the next movie reel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, this bill before us has kind of experienced the Perils of Pauline. It started out in a tremendous positive bipartisan spirit here in the House. Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Pallone on the majority and Mr. Deal and myself on the minority side and our colleagues in the rank-and-file worked together. We reported a bill, and I don't remember how many votes it got on the House floor, but I believe it was over 400. It got over to the other body, and they  modified it in some ways that were somewhat different than the House bill. The negotiations broke down, and it looked for a while this week that the Food and Drug Administration was going to have to send out reduction in force notices to over 2,000 employees at the Food and Drug Administration. But thanks to the tremendous leadership of Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Pallone and the help of people like Congressman Waxman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to be the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, along with Subcommittee  Ranking Member Deal, who has worked with the majority to put this compromise together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to stress the sensitivity of completing the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Program and the Medical Device User Fee Program right now. As I said earlier, if we were not to have done that by the end of this week, over 2,000 employees at the FDA would probably have received a reduction in force notice sometime next week or the week after. These are dedicated experts who are responsible for reviewing and approving new drugs, biologics and medical devices. If we were to lose  those individuals, we would probably never get them back. That would have severe negative repercussions for everybody in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us will promote advancement in pediatric therapies both for pharmaceuticals and for medical devices. The Pediatric Rule and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act have helped to fill a void in pediatric medicine. Prior to these acts, many children were not getting the best treatment because the information was simply not available to determine how a drug would act on them. Drugs do perform differently in different patients, which is especially true when that patient  is a child. These acts have begun to provide physicians the information they need to make the best decisions for their pediatric patients. These two acts work together to ensure that accurate, timely pediatric use information is developed to ensure the best medical outcomes for the Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill preserves the 6-month incentive that companies receive to do additional testing in pediatric populations. I want to emphasize that. The bill before us preserves the 6-month pediatric exclusivity provision in current law, and I think that's a real accomplishment. Chairman Dingell should be commended for his leadership on that effort. I was glad to support him in that insistence on that particular provision. I would also like to thank Congresswoman Anna Eshoo for her  work on that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the legislation addresses the issue of drug safety. No drug is completely safe. All drugs have some risk. The goal of the Food and Drug Administration is to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh any potential risks and ensure that patients have access to life-saving and life-improving medications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today strives to ensure that the FDA has the authority to monitor drugs to ensure that the balance between the benefit and the risk remains in equilibrium. The FDA will now have the authority to require that drug sponsors conduct postmarket clinical trials. The FDA will now have the authority to require that a drug make a label change. The FDA will also now have the authority to impose additional requirements on a drug in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation  strategy when it is needed to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh its risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is a bipartisan compromise that does strengthen the FDA, it will improve children's health, and it will reauthorize programs that are essential to ensuring that patients have timely access to drugs and medical devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I reserve the balance of my time, I again want to thank Chairman Dingell, Subcommittee Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Deal, and all the rank-and-file members. I also want to especially thank Ryan Long on the minority staff, the gentleman that is sitting to my left. He stayed up all last night working on these final nuances. I shouldn't say this, but I'm told that he has the same clothes on today that he had on yesterday because he has worked so hard on this  bill. We do want to give him special commendation. And I would urge that he take the appropriate hygienic provisions as soon as possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an important day for American consumers. Thanks to the legislation the House is about to pass, the Food and Drug Administration will have the financial resources and authorities necessary to ensure patients have timely access to safe and effective therapies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, this bill is about drug safety. In order to empower the FDA to protect the public from harmful drugs, we are giving the agency new authority to compel important labeling changes. This is a significant improvement over current policy, where FDA must haggle with drug companies and protracted negotiations that put patients and consumers at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, FDA will also be better equipped to force drug manufacturers to fulfill their responsibility to the American public and complete postmarket study commitments which are critical to ensuring a drug is safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these important new authorities, this bill authorizes the collection of $225 million in new user fees, a significant increase in the amount of funds dedicated for the use of drug safety activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FDA Revitalization Act also provides for commonsense improvements to our Nation's food safety system, such as more stringent ingredient and labeling standards, establishment of an adulterated food registry, and improvements in public notifications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patients will be happy to know that the bill before us also requires greater transparency of drug makers by calling for clinical trials to be registered in a database monitored by the National Institutes of Health, along with basic results data. As we saw with the case of Avandia, making this information available to patients, providers and researchers is critical to uncovering potential harmful effects of a drug. And under this legislation, the public will also have greater access to internal  documents that FDA used in its review of a drug application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also secure FDA scientists' right to publish by requiring the Secretary to establish clear policies on the timely clearance of articles written by FDA employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill would make significant progress in reducing the number of conflicted experts who serve on advisory committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to say that this bill reauthorizes two very important programs for our Nation's children, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research and Equity Act. These programs have been crucial in the successful cultivation of important research used by doctors and parents to better determine what kinds of drug therapy is safest and most appropriate for a child patient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the two existing programs, we're creating a new program that would help provide device manufacturers with greater incentives to conduct research and development of pediatric devices. Combined, these three bills will strengthen the research being done on pediatric uses of drugs and devices, and will make sure that our Nation's children have access to the medicines and therapies they need to grow up healthy and strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, this bill reauthorizes two critically important user fee agreements with respect to prescription drugs and medical devices. These programs provide FDA with the necessary resources to review applications in a timely manner so patients who rely on new and improved drugs and devices don't have to go without. In addition to reauthorizing these existing user fee programs, this bill would establish a new user fee for the specific purpose of reviewing direct-to-consumer advertising.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to commend Mr. Dingell, our ranking member Mr. Barton, Mr. Deal, and all of the members here, Mr. Waxman, Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Markey. Their leadership on these issues has been unwavering. It is to their credit that we have a bill on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a great victory for American consumers that will make tremendous strides in empowering the FDA and restoring public confidence in its ability to protect the public health, and I would urge my colleagues to vigorously support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to, first of all, thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Pallone for working in a bipartisan fashion on this very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, the work of the FDA is vital to the health and safety of the citizens of this country, and especially legislation such as this that enhances their ability to deal with the questions of drug safety and the monitoring capabilities and the continuing programs that are so vital both to the drugs and to medical devices which require review and approval by the FDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The user fee programs that are being reauthorized by this legislation are very important to fulfilling their role in meeting their personnel needs to achieve a timely review of drugs and medical devices, and I believe that Congress should not and cannot afford to delay further action on this package. Certainly to do so would require FDA to begin to scale back their personnel, and none of us want to see that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, patients demand and deserve to know that the medications they are taking are safe and effective, and that the FDA has adequate resources, both pre- and postmarket, in order to ensure that the safety of the Nation's drug supply is intact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation makes sensible bipartisan strides in that direction and balances the need to bring new life-saving medications to market, and at the same time provide the necessary protections for patient safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all compromises, there was a necessary give-and-take from all sides to bring this bill to the floor today. I think it is through the responsible work of the leadership of our committee of Energy and Commerce and through the processes that the committee has followed that we were able to accomplish that on this very significant piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill and hope that our colleagues across the rotunda would do likewise so that we can present a bill to the desk of the President for his signature which will keep this vital program and functions of FDA going forward and will not allow it to expire.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California who has been a leader on this issue for so many years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are considering provides FDA with critical tools the agency has been desperately lacking in its efforts to protect the American public from unsafe drugs. This legislation will provide FDA with the ability to require companies to update their drug label with new information, and FDA won't have to haggle with companies to get them to make those changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also says, in giving FDA this labeling change authority, Congress is making it clear that we do not intend to impact a drug company's responsibility to promptly update its label with safety information on its own accord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also gives FDA the authority to require companies to conduct postmarket studies and clinical trials of drugs. And it creates a mandatory clinical trial registry and results database to increase the transparency of those trials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before we break our arms trying to pat ourselves on the back, I want to express my deep disappointment that today we are walking away from a critical opportunity to make some reasonable adjustments to the windfall profits that drug companies receive for conducting pediatric studies under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. This is not about whether those pediatric studies should be done. We all agree about that. They are being done now. There is no question they will continue  to be done. But if we were to cut back slightly on the term of exclusivity for only the blockbuster drugs, that would make a great deal of difference to people who are paying the high cost for pharmaceuticals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, we lost that opportunity, and it is going to hurt a lot of our consumers. In my view, there is simply no justification for rewarding companies with incentives that are so far in excess of the actual cost of doing the studies themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also deeply disturbed the legislation fails to remove the sunset on FDA's authority to require pediatric studies under the Pediatric Research and Equity Act. There is absolutely no reason Congress needs to keep revisiting this commonsense measure that allows FDA to get essential information about whether new therapies are safe and effective for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So although I am pleased that today will provide FDA with important new authorities and resources, I must express my deep regret that we fail to take this opportunity to help individuals, businesses, State governments and insurers who pay the bill for the higher prices that result when generic competition is delayed for these expensive blockbuster drugs. I think it is a shame. We are talking about drugs of $5 billion in sales a year. If they spend a couple million dollars for their studies, they  are being overreimbursed at the consumer's expense.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First of all, I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Dingell, your staffs, Mr. Waxman, Ranking Member Barton and Mr. Deal, all the Members on the Republican side for the product that is here, all of the staff which has worked on it for so long. My own staff, Kate Bazinsky, who is sitting right here, just was married 2 months ago, this has definitely affected those first 2 months of marriage, the incredible negotiations that have taken  place to reach this point, along with Mark Bayer who was working on the privacy parts of this legislation with your staffs. I congratulate everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the final bill before us today retains the core drug safety and clinical trial provisions from the bill that Congressman Waxman and I introduced in March, which will improve transparency at the FDA and make drugs safer. Although I had hoped the sunset would be removed from the pediatric rule and less exclusivity given to blockbuster products under the pediatric incentive program, this bill is a historic achievement which will make drugs and medical devices safer for  consumers around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The past several years have been marked by drug scandal after drug scandal, Vioxx, Ketek, Paxil and Avandia. These drugs have harmed families across the country and come to symbolize the urgent need for reform at the FDA. Taking drugs should not be a game of RX roulette, and yet the FDA's current system is broken, and thousands of American families have been harmed by drugs with dangerous side effects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the House is responding to those failures. The bill is a victory for consumers and for patients. The bill will empower the FDA with important new authorities to mandate label changes and require postmarket studies. However, these new FDA authorities do not change the responsibility of companies to maintain drug labels and warn the public about risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the first time ever, the FDA will have the power to impose civil monetary penalties on companies that fail to conduct required postmarket studies. It will also establish a new postmarket risk identification and analysis system to identify harmful side effects without compromising patient privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2004, I have been fighting for a mandatory clinical trial registry and results database which will ensure that the public has accurate and complete information about drugs and devices.  This bill will create that mandatory clinical trials database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also extremely pleased that the FDA package includes language from the Markey-Rogers pediatric devices bill which is a major step forward for getting better and better devices for kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the chairman from New Jersey for all his great work.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Health Subcommittee as well as all of my colleagues that have worked so hard to bring this bill forward. So I rise, obviously, in support of it because I think the bill is going to make an enormous difference in the safety and the effectiveness of drugs and medical devices used to treat adults and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the bill also strengthens the FDA. I think the American people want the FDA to be an agency that is strong in its protection of consumers around the country. We know that there have been shortcomings that have had terrible effects on many families in our country. So, I think this bill is a victory in that arena.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that the bill adopts much of my legislation relative to children and pharmaceutical drugs for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has instructed us that only about 25 percent of drugs administered to children have been appropriately tested and labeled for use in kids. Pediatricians often had to prescribe adult pharmaceuticals for children by telling parents, "cut the pill in half, cut it in thirds, cut it in quarters." We understood that we had to do better. By every  measurement, the reauthorization of this legislation, previous legislation, was supported because it was very, very successful. We know that children are not small adults, and the legislation recognizes that. We have reauthorized, and we are doing the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the blockbuster provision is not a part of this legislation. The other body supported that. I didn't. This bill doesn't. In all negotiations, there is always give-and-take. There are items I supported that didn't make it into the package, including the permanent extension of the Pediatric Research Equity Act, which I championed, obviously, as part of my legislation in the original House bill. I hope that we can get to this at some point. I am sorry it is not in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overall, I want to thank all of my colleagues that made this possible and that we are here today; certainly, Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, most especially the professional staff, because they do so much work, no one more than John Ford of our staff, and Virgil Miller. I would like to also thank Jennifer Nieto Carey, formerly of my staff, who worked so hard and extensively to help bring us to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a good bill. I think the whole House should support it. I think it is a tribute to the substance of it, that it is coming up under suspension. I salute everyone that made the effort a winning one. Most importantly, I think the bill is a winner for the people of our country, both children and adults.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Revisions I crafted with my colleague, Mr. Doyle, the FDA and others require the creation of a unique device identification, or a UDI, system for medical devices that will help take important strides to improve the public health. Medical devices cannot easily be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion with current tools. A UDI system will enable the FDA to detect warning signs of a defective device earlier and quickly respond to recalls. Every person with an artificial knee, hip,  pacemaker or any one of the thousands of other medical devices will benefit once this UDI system is in place.</paragraph>

This bill gives consumers a larger role in deciding how user fees are spent to enhance drug safety, a huge victory for consumer protection. It will take steps to enhance the kind of information that will be available to patients and their families as they make personal decisions regarding their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased by the inclusion of an amendment I offered that will improve consumer's awareness of the MedWatch program, one of FDA's best but least known ways of monitoring adverse drug events once a product has been approved. Consumer reports of bad effects signal to FDA when prescription drugs pose a threat. The success of this program is crucial to postmarketing surveillance. Unfortunately, 9 out of 10 Americans are unaware that the MedWatch program exists, yet adverse drug and  device reactions account for as many as 100,000 deaths every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment requires that printed prescription drug ads include information on how to report side effects to the FDA's MedWatch program, both on the Internet and through a 1-800 number. It also requires the FDA to do a study on how we can best include this important information on the TV ads that have become so pervasive and influential in our society. So, again, I thank the chairman and staff for working with me to include this language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes a strong statement about the importance of protecting people who rely on prescription medications to get through their day and remain active members of society. I am encouraged by the steps it takes toward a safer, more transparent Food and Drug Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank our staff and urge the adoption of this bill and I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank everyone, particularly the staff that were involved in putting this legislation together and all the negotiations. I want to thank our legislative counsel, Warren Burke, Energy and Commerce Republicans, Ryan Long and Nandan Kenkeremath; Mr. Deal's staff, John Little; our Energy and Commerce Democrats, John Ford, Pete Goodloe, Virgil Miller, Bobby Clark; and Mr. Waxman's staff, Karen Nelson, Rachel Sher, Stephen Cha, Anne Witt; and also Mr. Markey's  staffperson, Kate Bazinsky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Needless to say, this bill is a product of a lot of hard work here in the House on both sides of the aisle, and, of course, we are also expecting, since this is going to be a consensus bill passed on the suspension list today, that it will pass easily in the Senate hopefully tonight or tomorrow. And it really addresses the problems and the safety issues that have come to light in the last few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I think many of us know there has been a lot of media attention to the fact that oftentimes drugs in the postmarketing situation have been problems. People have died. People have gotten sick. This bill I think effectively addresses those issues. I hope  and expect that it will be noticed, because it will make a difference in people's lives.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the legislation are poised to pass today provides FDA, for the first time, critical tools that the Agency has been desperately lacking in its efforts to protect the American public from unsafe drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will provide FDA with the ability to require companies to update their drug label with new safety information. Our goal here is to address tragic situations like Vioxx. In that case, because FDA could not compel the company to promptly make a labeling change, the Agency haggled with the company for 14 months before consumers were finally warned about serious cardiac risks in the drug label. This is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, this legislation will make clear that, in giving FDA this labeling change authority, Congress does not intend to impact, in any way, a drug company's responsibility to promptly update its label with safety information on its own accord. Under FDA's current regulations, companies are required to add new warnings to their labels as soon as they learn of new dangers, even if FDA has not yet required the change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In promulgating those regulations, FDA made a sensible policy choice. FDA recognized that the companies themselves are in the best position to know about risks associated with their own drugs. Logically, then, the companies should also be charged with the duty to make consumers aware of a drug's risk at the earliest possible moment. FDA recognized that drug safety is first and foremost a shared responsibility between the Agency and the company. And, today, Congress is making it clear that we  do not mean to disrupt that balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will also give FDA for the first time the authority to require companies to conduct post-market studies and clinical trials of drugs. Another section of the bill creates a mandatory clinical trial registry and results database to increase the transparency of those trials. Both of these provisions will make a critical contribution towards increasing the safety of our drugs once they are on the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to express my deep disappointment that this legislation failed to adopt a compromise that would have provided consumers with much-needed relief from the ever-increasing cost of drugs. Today, we are walking away from a critical and very rare opportunity to make some reasonable adjustments to the windfall profits drug companies receive for conducting pediatric studies under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not about whether these pediatric studies should be done. We all agree about that. They are being done now. And there is no question that they would continue to be done if we were to cut back slightly on the term of exclusivity for just the blockbuster drugs that are realizing profits many times over the cost of doing pediatric studies. The Senate did this in its bill and I regret that the compromise agreement we are considering today did not reflect anything from the Senate approach  on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, there simply is no justification for rewarding companies with incentives that are far in excess of the actual costs of the studies themselves--often hundreds of times over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also am deeply disturbed that this legislation fails to remove what is an unprecedented sunset on FDA's statutory authority to require pediatric studies under the Pediatric Research and Equity Act. There is no reason Congress needs to keep revisiting this common sense measure that allows FDA to get critical information about whether new therapies are safe and effective for children--FDA quite obviously needs to have the ability to require that new treatments be tested in children. And there  need not be any further discussion about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, although I am pleased that we will provide FDA with critical new authorities and resources in this bill today, I must express my deep regret that we failed to take this opportunity to help individuals, businesses, State governments, and insurers who pay the bill for the higher prices that result when generic competition is delayed for these expensive, blockbuster drugs.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference agreement to reauthorize important user fee programs at the Food and Drug Administration and enact critical drug safety reforms at the agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the result of intense negotiations between the House and Senate, whose negotiators have worked tirelessly to reach consensus on this legislation. They did so with a looming deadline of September 31, after which the user fee program would expire and many hard-working FDA scientists would likely lose their jobs. To reach a compromise, all parties to the negotiation had to give and take, but I am pleased that the product before us represents something we can all support. I would  like to congratulate the negotiators on their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 makes important changes at the FDA to place a greater emphasis on post-market surveillance within the agency. The Risk, Evaluation, and Mitigation Strategy established by this bill would give the agency the authority to monitor drugs throughout their life-cycle for adverse events or other signs of safety concerns. A critical aspect of this strategy is the additional authority this bill gives the Secretary of HHS to mandate that drug manufacturers conduct post-market  studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, the additional post-market activities extend to the user fee programs that help fund the drug approval process. Specifically, this bill directs drug manufacturers utilizing the FDA's drug approval process to dedicate an additional $225 million over 5 years for postmarket surveillance activities at the FDA. This additional funding represents an important investment by the pharmaceutical industry in the FDA's post-market safety activities, while also ensuring that pre-market user  fees are adequate to bring potentially life-saving medicines to market in a reasonable time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that the labeling and liability language prompted a great deal of debate during conference negotiations, but one thing is clear: the Congress in no way intends to limit the ability of a patient injured by a drug to seek redress from our Nation's justice system. FDA should have the ability to require labeling changes, but that additional authority does not absolve the drug manufacturer of any duty to initiate labeling changes on their own when new data bears out the need for  a change. The implementation of stronger drug safety authorities does not mean that drug companies get a free pass when their products harm consumers. I am pleased that the conference agreement makes this point perfectly clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also reauthorizes the Medical Device User Fee Act, as well as the Best Pharmaceuticals For Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act, which help ensure that pharmaceuticals are tested for their effect on children. After all, we know that children are not simply smaller adults, and part of protecting America's children is knowing how best to treat them when they face health concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank our Chairman, Mr. DINGELL, and our Health Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. PALLONE, for their work on this important legislation, and encourage my colleagues to support this important bill. These necessary changes at the FDA will go a long way toward restoring the American public's confidence in the agency and its ability to ensure the safety of the Nation's drug supply.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will make an enormous difference in the safety and effectiveness of drugs and medical devices used to treat adults and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased that the bill adopts much of my legislation (<bill type="h" number="2589">H.R. 2589</bill>, Improving Pharmaceuticals for Children Act) to renew the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA). Together, BPCA and PREA represent two halves of a comprehensive effort to make sure that prescription drugs are appropriately tested and labeled for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, about 25 percent of drugs administered to children have been appropriately tested and labeled for use in kids. Pediatricians often have to prescribe drugs for "off-label" use, because the drug has not been studied in appropriate FDA-approved pediatric clinical trials. Children are not small adults; they have specific medical needs that have to be considered when drugs are used. Children have died or suffered serious side effects after taking  drugs that were shown safe for use in adults but had different results in children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill helps improve drug safety for children in two ways. First, under BPCA, the bill provides an incentive, an extra 6 months of marketing exclusivity, for a drug if the innovator company agrees to undertake comprehensive pediatric studies requested by the FDA. Second, under PREA, FDA is granted authority to require studies when there is a demonstrated need and drug companies are required to submit a pediatric assessment each time they apply to market a new drug or change an existing drug's  indication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased this bill continues the BPCA incentive without the so-called "blockbuster provision" adopted by the Senate. The Senate's proposal would have reduced the incentive for drugs with annual sales of $1 billion, and, I believe the Senate language had the potential to kill "the goose that laid the golden egg." The 6-month incentive has worked. According to GAO, 81 percent of the time FDA has offered this incentive for a drug, drug companies have accepted, undertaking studies that have  generated pediatric data that would otherwise not have been available. Scaling back the incentive for "blockbusters" would risk that proven record of success. That is a gamble on the  health of children, and I'm pleased it's not in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all negotiations there is give and take. There are items I supported that didn't make it into this package, including the permanent extension of PREA which I championed as part of my legislation and the original House bill. I hope we'll have a chance to revisit the issue in the next reauthorization, if not sooner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On balance, this bill will make a huge improvement in the safety of drugs and devices. We should pass it and send it to the President today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Chairman DINGELL, Ranking Member BARTON and the professional staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, especially John Ford and Virgil Miller, as well as Jennifer Nieto Carey formerly of my staff, who worked extensively on this bill.</paragraph>
