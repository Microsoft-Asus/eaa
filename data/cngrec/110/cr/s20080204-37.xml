    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of <bill type="sr" number="441">S. Res. 441</bill>, submitted earlier today by Senator Schumer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will report the resolution by title.</chair>
  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>A resolution (<bill type="sr" number="441">S. Res. 441</bill>) congratulating the New York Giants on their victory in Super Bowl XLII.</narrative>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have asked for time because I rise to speak about something that happened in Arizona yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to congratulate the New York Giants on their much deserved Super Bowl victory last night, which very few thought would happen. But we Giants always knew we could prevail; we just couldn't pick the circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will also be offering on behalf of myself, my colleague from New York, Senator Clinton, and my two colleagues from our neighboring State of New Jersey, in which the Giants stadium is located, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Menendez, this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Big Blue, for the few of you who missed the game--I heard it had one of the biggest TV ratings we have had in a long time--the Big Blue defeated the heavily favored New England Patriots in what will go down as not only one of the greatest Super Bowl upsets in history but one of the most exciting and closely contested games in all of sports history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am wearing the red, white, and blue. I usually enjoy wearing the red, white, and blue because I love America, but today I am particularly enjoying wearing those colors because I love the Giants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under enormous pressure, facing one of the most talented, methodical teams ever assembled, the Giants came from behind, battling back twice, to take that title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning of the season, the chattering class said the Patriots were an unstoppable force that would march untouched to a comfortable,  some even said "large," Super Bowl victory, with the Giants a mere afterthought, a stepping stone on their road to greatness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the Giants proved them wrong again and today we are world champions. Now, I have been a Giant fan since I was 5 years old. I remember "Chuckin" Charlie Connerly and Sam Huff and Frank Gifford and Alex Webster. Back then the two most important Roosevelts to me were Brown and Grier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Giants have won Super Bowls before. But this victory, coming from behind and defying the odds, makes this win to Giants' fans the sweetest of all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Giants showed the grit and determination New York is known for. They would not be denied at any point in the game, keeping the pressure on through all four quarters. Throughout the game, the Giants excelled on both sides of the ball. I am particularly amazed and impressed with that Giant defense. The Patriots have one of the best offenses in football ever, certainly the best this year. But the Giant front--Michael Strahan, Osi Umenyora, Justin Tuck--stifled them. They put the pressure on  Tom Brady so he actually missed passes. That did not happen very much, and the usually unflappable quarterback was back on his heels for most of the game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then the Giant offense. The doubters of Eli Manning were silenced for good--Two touchdown passes, that game-winning drive at the end, where no one thought the Giants could do it. And what a catch by David Tyree. He used his helmet, his face mask, his shoulder pads, and his chest gear to catch that ball and pave the way for that final touchdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Coughlin, though bruising at times, kept the team together and focused, proving yet again that it ain't over until it is over. The hard-fought win sent shockwaves through the football establishment and sent New Yorkers cheering into the streets until the wee hours of the evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Yorkers certainly deserve every minute of sweet celebration, and we look forward to that great tickertape parade I hope I will be able to go to if the voting schedule works out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke to Commissioner Goddell today and congratulated him on an exciting Super Bowl. It was not only a great day for New York football but a great day for football in general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a note. Two members of the Giant family were lost in recent years: Wellington Mara, the heart and soul of a team if there ever was one, and Bob Tisch, a good friend of mine. And their steadfastness led to this success. I am sure they are looking down from heaven and smiling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I, on behalf of all New Yorkers, and the Senate, or at least most of the Senate, congratulate the New York football Giants for winning Super Bowl XLII and celebrating their extraordinary victory. I would like to send congratulations to my New York colleague, Senator Clinton, who, of course, is on the campaign trail today. But I know she was thrilled about the victory, as were my colleagues from New Jersey, Senators LAUTENBERG and MENENDEZ.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, for his statement about the Super Bowl game that was played yesterday, and his congratulations to the Giants. And notice, I did not say the New York Giants, though that is the name, and we are as proud of that team as we in New Jersey could be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But pride in my birthplace, my home all my life, the State I am privileged to serve in the Senate, forces me to remind everyone that though we treasure our neighbors' interests in New York, the Giants' home is in New Jersey, many of the players live in New Jersey, the home games are played in New Jersey, and there cannot be any doubt about the fan loyalty and the attendance of our proud New Jersey residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to take nothing away from that smashing victory--that wonderful game, by the way, that was said by everyone I have met and talked to--even though our pride, our hopes were with the Giants, the fact is, it was a wonderful football game, and we cannot take away the greatness also of the New England Patriots football team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a tremendous season, a remarkable run through the playoffs, and a miraculous achievement against the AFC's best--the New England Patriots--our Giants are now the Super Bowl champions for the third time in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, the Giants did what those of us in New Jersey and across the country believed they could do: They took the crown from the king. To capture the crown, they made key plays under pressure. The game started with a field goal, but the Patriots came right back and held the lead for much of the game. But with 2 minutes left, and their backs against the wall, the Giants came from behind to score the winning touchdown. The team showed guts and strength and courage, as they had throughout the  season and through the playoffs. Last night, we saw them at their best. By winning the Super Bowl, our Giants are truly nominated to be the best team in the NFL, and they brought the Super Bowl trophy right back to its rightful place in New Jersey. From their home turf in East Rutherford, NJ, to the Super Bowl win in Arizona--and it was a wonderful setting and an outstanding opportunity to display our Giant greatness--the Giants stood tall and showed that against all odds they were champions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a pleasure it was to see the quarterback, Eli Manning, show his championship colors by hanging on as the Patriot defense came after him time and time again. What a wonderful family place that is to have two sons who are such expert football players. But Eli finally was able to come out of the shadow and take his place alongside his brother's great play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Tyree, a New Jersey native, scored the first touchdown and had an incredible catch with barely a minute left in play, falling back and pinning the ball tight against his helmet as he fell to the ground. He was holding onto that ball, and nothing could pull it from his arms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plaxico Burress caught the game-winning touchdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offensive line, anchored by Rutgers University alumnus and New Jersey resident Shaun O'Hara, showed the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And don't forget, they say that defense wins championships. We saw a lot of that yesterday. The defensive line, led by Michael Strahan, also a New Jersey resident, stopped the record-setting Patriot offense in its tracks. It was no minor accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, our defense allowed only 14 points against a team that averaged more than 36 points a game during the regular season--an incredible accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Giants ran and passed, and they sacked their way to a championship and into the record books. The Giants have long had a place in the hearts and minds of New Jerseyans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the team does bear the New York name, their home has been in New Jersey for more than 30 years. Right now, one can see--if you pass the area where the Meadowlands in New Jersey is--they are building a brandnew stadium to keep them playing and winning in New Jersey for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Rutgers University to the Giants and the Jets, we have a proud and deep tradition of winning football in the Garden State. I am so proud the tradition lives on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Mara and Tisch families, Tom Coughlin, the rest of the coaching staff, and the entire Giants team for an incredible Super Bowl victory. Giant fans cannot wait to bring the trophy back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all New Jerseyans and our fans across the country, I am pleased--so pleased--to be able to call our Giants "champions."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The play that was displayed was magnetic, was fascinating. It will go down as one of the great Super Bowl games in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we note, once again, just a reminder: Do not always call them the New York Giants. Just say Giants. That is enough. While we are under full cover of our pride and our allegiance, we call them the "Jersey Giants."</paragraph>
