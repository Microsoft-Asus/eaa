  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush vetoed a plan to fund our troops and to change the direction in Iraq. Following his veto, the House voted for the fourth time in 3 months for a new direction in Iraq and rejected the President's open-ended commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, House Republicans have refused to join us in our attempts to change the course of the war. Republican Leader Boehner said over the weekend that he wants a clean bill. What he is really saying is that he wants us to rubber-stamp the President's war proposal. That's what Republican Congresses have been doing for 4 years, and it hasn't helped our military and it hasn't made America safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When are House Republicans going to realize that the American people overwhelmingly support benchmarks and a real plan to change direction in Iraq? One encouraging sign was when Leader Boehner said this weekend that he would be willing to look at a plan B in September. Does that mean that House Republicans will finally begin to join us in changing the course of the war in Iraq? We'll have to wait and see.</paragraph>
