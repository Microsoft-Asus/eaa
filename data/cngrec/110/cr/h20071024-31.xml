  <narrative>MUHAMMAD A. NASSARDEEN, FOUNDER OF RECYCLING BLACK DOLLARS IN LOS ANGELES -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11990]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was with great sorrow that I learned of the loss of a stalwart champion of political and business empowerment within the Los Angeles community. I'm speaking of Mr. Muhammad A. Nassardeen, a pioneering entrepreneur and a staunch promoter of "economic activism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Muhammad Nassardeen founded Recycling Black Dollars in 1988 as a way  to encourage African Americans and others to patronize African American-owned businesses and promote the practice as a much needed strategy for revitalizing the community and addressing problems such as unemployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Muhammad Nassardeen never saw the City of Los Angeles as it is, but he envisioned what it could be. He was "connector" extraordinaire. He connected black consumers with black businesses, and black business owners with one another. It is estimated that some 2,000 to 3,000 businesses benefited from the work of Recycling Black Dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Muhammad Nassardeen's vision and focus on the economic empowerment and advancement of ethnic minorities in Los Angeles will be sorely missed. He was a beacon of light out of economic darkness for many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The City of Los Angeles, colleagues, family and friends all mourn the loss of Muhammad A. Nassardeen, and I extend my most heartfelt condolences to his family, his colleagues, his many close friends in the Los Angeles business community and here on Capitol Hill.</paragraph>
