    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, an organization consisting of 45 nations working to reduce proliferation of nuclear weapons, announced that they had successfully implemented an agreement allowing for peaceful civilian nuclear cooperation with India. This is a great achievement for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Ambassador to Washington Ronen Sen. There were individuals of good faith on both sides of this issue whose concerns  were heard, and this latest step ends 3 years of negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time to finalize the agreement is now. And we should recognize what a civilian nuclear agreement would mean for our Nation, for our energy needs, and for our economy. The agreement will produce stable, clean power for the people of India, promoting the strong partnership with America. This nuclear agreement will mean more prosperity through new jobs and economic growth for India and America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
