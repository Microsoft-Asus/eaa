    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today it's my pleasure to extend my congratulations to Chris Locke, a walnut farmer from Lockeford, California, who recently earned an award from the Environmental Protection Agency for sustainable farming practices. He tends 580 acres of walnuts on a plot of land in a town that his great-great grandfather founded and which bears his family's name, Lockeford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chris utilizes pest control practices that reduce the need for chemical sprays. His methods include pheromone-based treatments as well as maintaining plants that attract beneficial insects and birds that control rodents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chris' motivation is an admirable example of sustainable farming and stands as a shining illustration of the increasing commitment of San Joaquin County farmers and growers to environmentally friendly agricultural techniques. As a pioneer in the field, Chris has generously offered to share his techniques with fellow farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my honor to recognize Chris and to congratulate him for his well-deserved award.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
