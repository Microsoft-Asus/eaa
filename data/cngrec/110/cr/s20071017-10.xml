  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could briefly say, while the distinguished Republican leader is on the floor, I had a meeting late yesterday afternoon with the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller. He indicated to me that he and Senator Bond, the vice chair of that Intelligence Committee, are moving forward this week to have a markup on the Intelligence bill. It will be bipartisan. Senator Leahy has announced he would move very quickly with the  Judiciary Committee, which has joint jurisdiction of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully, we can have that bill to us within the next couple of weeks. We should get that done so it is not a last-minute deal like it was right before we broke for one of our breaks. I think it was before the August recess when we were pushed so hard on that matter. So I think things are moving along well. The Intelligence Committee is working extremely well. I am very satisfied with the work they have accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see one of the members of the Intelligence Committee on the floor today, Senator Nelson, who has been such a great addition to the Intelligence Committee. He and other members of that Intelligence Committee devote hours of their time away from the TV cameras, away from reporters, trying to work out ways we can move forward against the evil that is focused on our Nation.</paragraph>
