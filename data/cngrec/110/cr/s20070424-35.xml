    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor one of the great inspirations to the young people of my hometown, Bishop Aretha E. Morton, who will be retiring this week from the Tabernacle Full Gospel Baptist Cathedral in Wilmington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this day, 48 years ago, she preached her trial sermon; 24 years later she was ordained, becoming the first woman to pastor a Baptist Church in Delaware. She has now served longer than any pastor in her church's almost 90-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She also made history in 1993 by becoming the first woman, and the first African-American, to be a chaplain for the Wilmington Fire Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Around Wilmington, where everyone knows Bishop Morton, she is affectionately called "Mother"--and for good reason. She has spent her career reaching out to my city's youth, inspiring students to achieve and offering something that those in trouble don't have enough of--hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of us in this Chamber, she is an example of what the country needs more of right now, someone with a lot of love in her heart, who teaches tolerance and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Bishop Morton the very best and hope that she has more time to spend with her children, Lorraine Gaskins and Dr. Donald Morton, seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
