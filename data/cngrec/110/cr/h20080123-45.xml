  <narrative>HONORING PRIVATE BOOKER TOWNSELL -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H432]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Senator Bill Nelson and I introduced legislation today to amend the dark chapter of American history by providing a fair and just settlement for our African American soldiers who were wrongly convicted after an incident at Fort Lawton during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Saturday, I stood with the family of Booker Townsell at his gravesite in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At long last, Private Booker Townsell received a burial with full honors, in a ceremony filled with emotion and symbolism. At long last, Booker Townsell received the military honors he deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to read into the Record the remarks I read last Saturday because Booker and his family deserve to have his long overdue military honors permanently etched into the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the House, I represent Seattle in King County, Washington, home to Fort Lawton and home to author Jack Hamann. He exposed what Booker Townsell, his family and others have often lived and known for a long time, that the color of their skin determined their fate and denied them due process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on behalf of the people in my Seventh District, who live in a county proudly named in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, let me sum up our feelings by quoting Dr. King: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I got into this fight. America cannot and must not permit  racial injustice to breathe the same air that we breathe, or to live among us as a plague upon our Nation, or to poison the sweet light of day with its grim darkness of evil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We come here today in the name of justice, to fully and finally honor Private Booker Townsell, a soldier, a hero, an African American who served his country in a time of war, only to be deserted by his country in his time of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Racial injustice struck down this innocent man, and others, who were denied the opportunity to live their lives with a full measure of honor for their military service and who were denied all their rightful benefits for their military service, including the right of their family to receive an American flag when they passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American flag is a powerful symbol of our Nation's strength, unity and commitment to core values like equal justice under the law and equal rights. Today our flag also represents the courage of an Army private and the dignity of his family to accept justice delayed after being denied so long, and it represents the ability of a great Nation to look inward and admit a grave injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a proud day for Private Booker Townsell and his family. He has been promoted from Army private to American role model, and his life, service and this day teaches us a lot about ourselves and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. King said: The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Booker Townsell, and his family and others like Sam Snow who lives in Florida, stood up to the challenge and, in so doing, stood up for us all. Today, on their behalf, America renews its vow to fight racial injustice, to acknowledge the deep and tragic mistakes of the past and to restore hope in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in Washington the work is not finished. The legislation Senator Nelson and I introduced today will, along with others, including Congresswoman Moore from Milwaukee, direct the Army to provide the Fort Lawton survivors like Sam Snow in Florida and families like Booker Townsell with the economic benefits to which they're entitled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's the least we can do. I also hope that we can put a memorial on the Fort Lawton site to teach future generations about the sacrifices made by Booker Townsell, Sam Snow, and others, and to remind us that we must never forget that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we salute Private Booker Townsell and his loved ones on behalf of this grateful Nation. We are grateful for his military service, his courage, and his dignity, and grateful that America is strong enough to admit its mistakes and provide justice and honor at long last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to enter into the Record an article from the Milwaukee Sentinel dated 19 January 2008, entitled, "Injustice Undone."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Injustice Undone: Soldier Honored More Than 20 Years After Death</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Meg Kissinger)</narrative>
  <narrative>Carol Blalock closed her eyes and smiled as the sound of gunshots rang through the bitter cold morning air on Saturday.</narrative>
  <narrative>At long last, justice had been served.</narrative>
  <narrative>Her father, Booker Townsell, who died in 1984, had finally been granted full military honors, a proper military burial at Graceland Cemetery on Milwaukee's northwest side. An Army contingent, including Ronald James, Assistant Secretary of the Army, traveled to Milwaukee to correct an injustice begun more than 63 years ago.</narrative>
  <narrative>In August 1944, Townsell and 42 other African-American soldiers were blamed for the lynching death of an Italian prisoner of war at Fort Lawton, an Army base outside Seattle. Many of them, including Townsell, were convicted of rioting. Two others were convicted of manslaughter.</narrative>
  <narrative>The story might have ended there, had it not been for curiosity of a television reporter named Jack Hamann, who, along with his wife, Leslie, spent 20 years uncovering the facts of the case. Their account, in the book "On American Soil: How Justice Became a Casualty of World War II," prompted a bipartisan call for the convictions to be overturned and full military honors to be restored. In October, the Army reversed the conviction of Townsell and the others.</narrative>
  <narrative>Hamann stood at the front of the chapel at Graceland on Saturday, fighting back tears as the Army color guard played taps.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Reporters are trained to check out emotionally," he said. "But this one is tough."</narrative>
  <narrative>Also standing in the crowd was Ronald Hayes, a retired master sergeant and Townsell family friend, who likewise swallowed hard when Wisconsin Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Roger Lalich presented the U.S. flag to Townsell's oldest daughter, Marion Williamson.</narrative>
  <narrative>"This is good," Hayes said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Later in the day, nearly 200 people gathered at the Milwaukee County War Memorial Center to pay tribute to Townsell and to celebrate his ultimate exoneration.</narrative>
  <narrative>"He wouldn't have wanted this attention," Williamson told the crowd. "But he deserves it. I hope my father's soul can finally rest in peace."</narrative>
  <narrative>Speakers included Jim McDermott, Democratic congressman from the state of Washington who pushed to have the Army reverse the convictions.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Too often the color of skin defined fate and denied due process," McDermott said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., McDermott talked of why this decision is so important and the need to celebrate it so urgent.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere," he said. McDermott complimented the Army for admitting a grave mistake. He recalled the images of Townsell as a dedicated family man and factory worker, who danced with his children and cheered his granddaughter at her track meet.</narrative>
  <narrative>It would have been easy for Townsell to wallow in the bitterness of this dark chapter of his life, McDermott said. Instead, he chose to persevere. Again invoking King's words, McDermott said, "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."</narrative>
  <narrative>As far as Blalock and the other members of Townsell's family were concerned, Saturday's ceremony was no less precious because of the time it took to make things right.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I loved my father's laugh," Blalock said. "When they had that 21-gun salute and played taps, it was like I could hear him laugh again."</narrative>
