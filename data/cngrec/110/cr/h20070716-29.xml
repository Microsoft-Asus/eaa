    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="375">H. Res. 375</bill>, honoring United Parcel Service and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution, as introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland), honors the 100th anniversary of the United Parcel Service and recognizes its role in our global transportation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its founding in 1907 by James E. "Jim" Casey and Claude Ryan in Seattle, Washington, with $100 borrowed from a friend, United Parcel Service has grown from a two-person foot and bike messenger service into a worldwide transportation and logistics corporation. Today UPS is the world's largest package delivery company, employing over 427,000 workers, utilizing approximately 92,000 vehicles and operating the world's eighth largest airline. UPS plays an integral role in the movement of goods  in the constantly changing global economy, moving over 15 million packages through its network each business day. It is an important spoke in the global transportation wheel, connecting the flow of goods and information in the United States to more than 200 countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1929, UPS became the first package delivery company to provide air service. In 1975, it became the first package delivery company to serve every address in the continental USA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>UPS's contributions to our Nation go beyond simply transporting goods or providing logistics to our businesses. It has maintained its role as a leader in good business practices, with a commitment to social responsibility and diversity. It has also made a significant dedication to environmental stewardship through the UPS "Green Fleet," which recently passed the 100 million mark. The company also plays an important philanthropic role in the United States and has made sizable contributions to  numerous charitable organizations around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 375.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="375">H. Res. 375</bill>, honoring the United Parcel Service and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States, and all across this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is increasingly difficult for businesses to survive in today's global economy, and I am proud to offer this resolution honoring UPS as a company that has not only survived but one that has continued to grow and prosper for 100 years not only in this country but all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1907, when Mr. James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend to start a delivery company, I am sure that it was impossible for him to envision what his hard work would become.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it was purchasing his first delivery car in 1913, becoming the first package delivery company to provide air service in 1929, or using alternative fuels to power its fleet, UPS has continued to embrace technological advancements in order to better serve its customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, 100 years after its inception, UPS is a 427,000-employee global transportation corporation that moves nearly 15 million packages through its network each business day. While UPS is headquartered in my home State of Georgia, its presence is felt in every congressional district and all around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I believe it is fitting that we honor this tremendous achievement, and I urge all Members to support this resolution and recognize what brown has done for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I simply wanted to add that UPS also is very environmentally sensitive and uses natural gas in metropolitan areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would move that we support this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 375, which honors the United Parcel Service, UPS, and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States. Of the 425,000 jobs that UPS provides to hard-working people across the globe, 16,000 of them are in my home State of New Jersey. Included in that number are the employees that work at the Ramapo Ridge Data Center in Mahwah, NJ, in my District, one of two data centers supporting UPS worldwide  computer operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>UPS has made it a priority to integrate itself into the local community and has been a magnet for jobs in a variety of positions; from the high-tech workers at the Mahwah Data Center to the uniformed delivery people we meet on a daily basis in offices across the country. UPS continues to actively recruit from the local colleges and universities in my district, with internship and co-op opportunities for students who are studying Computer Science, Information Systems, Industrial Engineering, and  Mathematics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>UPS has also been recognized for its commitment to diversity. Twenty-nine percent of UPS's IT population is female, far higher than the IT population as a whole. In 2006, UPS was recognized as one of America's most supportive companies of both black and Hispanic engineering students by two independent surveys. Truly this is a company that has made a commitment to reach out to populations traditionally underrepresented in high-tech fields, and has continued to excel while doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With more and more American jobs being created in the services industry, it is companies such as UPS that serve as a great example of how U.S. businesses are adapting to our changing economy. When the American Messenger Company acquired its first delivery car, a Ford Model T, in 1913, perhaps the founders could have envisioned the nearly 100,000 cars, vans, trucks, and motorcycles that today comprise the delivery fleet of UPS. But surely they could not have envisioned the 14.5 million page views  that www.ups.com averages per day or the nearly 5,500 technology employees currently employed by UPS. As companies continue to adapt to the changing global economy, it is entirely appropriate that this House of Representatives recognize one such company that has not only adapted, but also stayed ahead of the curve for 100 years, while at the same time staying true to its original mission of delivering parcels from one to another.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this year we recognize the 100th Anniversary of the United Parcel Service, or UPS. UPS was founded in 1907 as the American Messenger Company by James E. Casey  in Seattle, Washington, with $100 borrowed from a friend. Since then, they have grown from a 2-person message delivery firm into a 427,000-plus employee global transportation and logistics corporation that moves nearly 15,000,000 packages through  its network each business day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 4th Congressional District is home to the Oak Street Processing facility. This facility employs hundreds of hard-working individuals and is critical to UPS' Long Island operations. I am proud to have such an instrumental facility in my district. I want to thank the UPS employees from the Oak Street Facility and throughout the nation, for their continued service and dedication to our country".</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="375">H. Res. 375</bill>, Honoring United Parcel Service and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a UPS facility in my district on Sweetwater Lane in Houston and I have visited the facility many times to speak with management and the employees who are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. I even delivered packages with the UPS employees a few years ago on the Beltway 8 and Intercontinental Airport Route. Many of my constituents work at this UPS location and I am pleased that UPS continues to be a responsible employer and corporate citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many businesses have difficulties surviving over time, but UPS has stayed strong for 100 years. We appreciate their strong relationship with the local communities and the services they provide worldwide. I am pleased to honor UPS for their 100 years of service and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="375">H. Res. 375</bill>--Honoring United Parcel Service and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States--and the more than 1000 UPS drivers, managers and other employees in the Third District of Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1907, UPS has become an everyday sight for many of us. In Washington, DC it is not remarkable to see one of the big, brown trucks every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for people in rural Nebraska, UPS is an invaluable resource. Rural delivery service--for many--is a life-line for homes far away from the local post office. UPS prides itself on delivery service to every address in North America and Europe, including areas where neighbors can be separated by miles of ranch and farmland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the honor of meeting with some UPS drivers, and I look forward to doing so again in the near future. Until then, I say "thank you" to all UPS employees and to "keep up the great work."</paragraph>
