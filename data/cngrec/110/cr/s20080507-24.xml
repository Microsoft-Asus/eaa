  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="RECOGNIZING BRIDGER HIGH SCHOOL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to give special recognition to the music department of Bridger High School for putting together an award-winning music education program. By demonstrating outstanding commitment to music education, Bridger High School won this year's GRAMMY</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Music plays an integral part in our daily lives. It helps to define who we are as individuals and as a nation. Through music we celebrate, we laugh, we grieve and we heal. An old song, like an old friend, helps to recall feelings and memories lost in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The power of music is undeniable. Music education, therefore, is a sound investment. It teaches discipline and provides an avenue to express deep and powerful emotions. It enhances a student's performance in other subject areas. It makes a fundamental difference in the quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes an even bigger difference in the lives of students from economically underserved school districts. Bridger is a small town with a population less than 1,000. Under the watchful guidance of their music director Michel Sticka and principal John Ballard, the 28 music students from Bridger High strived to distinguish themselves and their school. They have succeeded. And so, they deserve our respect and admiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being selected as a GRAMMY</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of a strong music education, for the students of Bridger High, the greatest reward comes from the lifelong benefit of being able to lead richer and fuller lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I couldn't be more proud of the students and faculty members at Bridger High School. They have gone above and beyond to put Bridger, MT, on the map, setting the standard for all Montana schools. I join my fellow Montanans in a chorus of praise for these 28 bright students on their extraordinary achievements: Benton D. Asbury, Katryna N. Asbury, Samantha J. Bobby, Jonathan E. Bostwick, Devon B. Caballero, Jenny M. Cooke, Jessica Denney, Karissa J. DeRudder, Sommer D. Dykstra, Rebekah Edelman,  Hayden D. Forsythe, Hannah Goetz, Jacey K. Griswold, Elliott G. McCarthy, Forrest C. McCarthy, Kimberly M. McClurg, Heidi R. Mudd, Wendi N. Mudd, Tara R. Murray, Lenore K. Pierson, Cole D. Schwend, Edward Stevenson, Andrea D. Sticka, Bailee M. Vaugh, Ryan J. Witt, Kyla M. Young, Tyler D. Young, Brittany N. Zentner.</paragraph>
