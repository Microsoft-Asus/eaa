    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an extraordinary scholar, leader, and friend, Dr. David M. Gipp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 2, Dr. Gipp will celebrate 30 years at the helm of United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck, ND. United Tribes Technical College, UTTC, is the only intertribally owned postsecondary vocational institution in the Nation. Since its founding in 1969, the college has served more than 10,000 students representing 75 federally recognized tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure as president, Dr. Gipp has spearheaded an incredible transformation of the college and in higher education for American Indians. Dr. Gipp was the first executive director of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium and later he served as its president. He was instrumental in the formulation of the Tribal Colleges or Universities Assistance Act, which started to address the Federal Government's obligation in providing higher education for American Indians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Dr. Gipp's leadership, UTTC has grown from just over 100 students and 12 programs of study to more than 1,018 students for the 2006-2007 school year with 24 different 2-year and certificate programs and bachelor's programs. In this time, Dr. Gipp has led the college's transition from traditional vocational trades to programs geared toward the labor needs of Indian Country. He also propelled UTTC into becoming the first tribal college in the Nation to be authorized to offer full online degree  programs. In recent years, Dr. Gripp has led the fight to restore funding for the college that was cut from the Department of Interior's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Gipp has been an agent of positive change in the lives of thousands of students who have attended United Tribes Technical College. He is a true champion for higher education and a powerful national advocate for the tribal colleges. His passion is infectious, and he has empowered individuals to reach to their goals no matter how small or large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Quincy Adams once said "[I]f your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader." Dr. Gipp is a leader in every sense of the word. I want to extend my congratulations to Dr. Gipp on 30 years as president of United Tribes Technical College.</paragraph>
