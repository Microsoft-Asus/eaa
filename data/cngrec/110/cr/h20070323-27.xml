  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House passed a bill claiming to be the U.S. Troop Readiness Act that included billions in pork barrel spending unrelated to the needs of our troops. The funding restrictions included in the bill were so unpopular that the congressional leadership loaded a $25 million bailout for spinach farmers, a $74 million payment for peanut storage, and a $283 million subsidy for milk producers, all to attract votes for the unpopular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As USA Today stated: "Votes were won for peanuts, or to be more accurate, for peanut subsidies." The bill also declares all of this spending, for spinach, for milk and peanut subsidies, as emergency wartime supplemental appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill passed $23 billion over budget. It only passed by four votes. Calculating a pork-to-vote ratio, that means that the Congress spent over $5 billion in pork spending per vote just to win passage for this legislation. And it is only March. How much more will the taxpayer be charged to pass other unpopular bills?</paragraph>
