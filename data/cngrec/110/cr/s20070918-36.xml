    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record the Senior League team of Cartersville, GA, on their victory in the 2007 Senior League World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These fine young men played outstanding baseball through the entire tournament, but in the World Series Championship game, they soared and played like true professionals. In their final game, Chris Huth pitched a complete game one-hitter and Cole Montgomery hit a three-run home run to lead their team to a dominating victory over the defending champion Falcon, Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are special young men: Garison Boston, Ben Bridges, Trey Dickson, Brad Green, Taylor Greene, Tyler Higgins, Chris Huth, Tyler Linn, Levi Mauldin, Colton Montgomery, Cole Payne, Zack Philliber, Hank Stewart, and Tyler Williams. The men have brought great pride to their State, great pride to their parents, and great pride to the great city of Cartersville, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their manager Eric Stewart and coaches Jeff Payne and Mark Montgomery each deserve strong recognition for guiding these young players to victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join Senator Chambliss in acknowledging the great achievement of these young men and to extend my deepest congratulations to the 2007 Senior League World Series Champions, the Senior League team of Cartersville, GA.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
