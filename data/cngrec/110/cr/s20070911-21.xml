  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="UNITED STATES NORTHERN COMMAND">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I commemorate the fifth anniversary of U.S. Northern Command, located in Colorado Springs, CO. I take enormous pride in seeing the Colorado flag fly alongside the flags of the United States and Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officially, USNORTHCOM was established on October 1, 2002. However, it was the terrible events of September 11, 2001, that made the country realize its need for increased homeland defense. Within 13 months of 9/11, USNORTHCOM stood up as the combatant command charged with defending the homeland and providing military assistance to civil authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years later, USNORTHCOM is proudly executing its missions of Homeland Defense and civil support operations to defend, protect, and secure the United States and its interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 9/11, our Nation has been engaged in a fight against terrorism on multiple fronts, including our homeland. As USNORTHCOM enters its fifth year, they are fully mission capable, prepared and ready to respond to the broad spectrum of homeland defense challenges that exist in today's dynamic security environment. USNORTHCOM is actively deterring threats from crossing our borders by closely working with other combatant commands, intelligence agencies and interagency partners to detect and defeat  threats before they arrive in our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to rendering assistance to civil authorities, U.S. Northern Command is prepared to help. By anticipating threats, ranging from natural disasters to man-made, the command provides Department of Defense capabilities in a timely and coordinated fashion. Facilitated by Defense coordinating officers attached to every FEMA region, USNORTHCOM works side by side with its interagency partners to support the States and their emergency response teams when requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its 5 short years of existence, USNORTHCOM has effectively responded to several catastrophes. They have been absolutely essential to saving lives while mitigating the suffering and losses experienced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USNORTHCOM understands the multi-agency approach to defending our homeland and providing support to civil authorities. Therefore, it places a high priority on building and strengthening relationships with the States, territories, other government and nongovernment agencies, as well as partnering with our border nations, Canada and Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USNORTHCOM is also actively engaged with the National Guard, and serves as the combatant command advocate to provide the Guard with the tools and resources necessary to accomplish their mission. A committed, lasting partnership between U.S. Northern Command and the National Guard will strengthen our national defense and defy those attempting to sabotage our way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also recognize the unsung heroes of this command, the men and women of U.S. Northern Command. They are synonymous with homeland defense; they are a total force team of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guardsmen from the active and Reserve Components of our military. The men and women of USNORTHCOM clearly understand the importance of their mission and carry out their responsibilities with a sense of urgency. Their pride in contributing to the defense of our great Nation is  evident in every aspect of their operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the men and women of U.S. Northern Command, I stand today to say: Thank you for your dedication and service to the United States of America. On the occasion of your fifth anniversary, I congratulate you for a job well done.</paragraph>
