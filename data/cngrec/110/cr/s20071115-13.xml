  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I mention that because I want to talk about two areas of speculation that bother me a lot, both of which relate not to the financial issues of this fiscal policy coming from President Bush, but it relates to the issue of whether you believe Government has a role in proper regulation in certain areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of a barrel of oil today is trading at $94 a barrel. It has been flirting with $100 a barrel. The price of oil has been going up, up, up in the last year. Well, it is interesting when you take a look at what is happening with oil prices. Take a look at supply and demand factors and ask yourself if the fundamentals with respect to oil supply and demand justify $100 a barrel of oil? The answer is no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read to you something from a fellow, Fadel Gheit, who works for Oppenheimer &amp; Sons. Here is what the energy analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Sons said last week. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is absolutely no shortage of oil. ..... I'm absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. ..... Oil speculators include "the largest financial institutions in the world." "Call it the world's largest gambling hall. ..... It's open 24/7. ..... Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. ..... This is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit, and everybody's going 120 miles per hour."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you what is happening with the price of oil. This is an oil analyst from Oppenheimer &amp; Sons saying that there is no justification for oil being a dime over $55 a barrel. We have hedge funds in the futures market buying oil. We have investment banks in the futures market. We have investment banks building facilities to store oil. Now, why are investment banks building facilities to store oil? It is because they believe oil will be more valuable in the future. If they buy it and store  it, then they will make money in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So instead of a futures market that works with respect to the fundamentals of the supply and demand of oil, we have a carnival of greed in the futures market, in my judgment. We have investment banks hip deep, we have hedge funds hip deep in this, and we have all kinds of things that are going on that are driving up the price of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who are the victims? The people filling up at the gas pumps have to pay this price that, in my judgment, is unsupported by the fundamentals of supply and demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the circumstance here? Well, the circumstance, like most things, is we do not have the capability to regulate very effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you this story, if I might, about a 32-year-old trader at a giant hedge fund, and I did not mention that hedge funds are in these markets as well, in a very big way. A 32-year-old trader at a hedge fund named Amaranth held sway over the price the country paid for natural gas a year or so ago. Let me tell you what he did. He helped lead to the collapse of an $8 billion hedge fund named Amaranth. This comes from the Washington Post:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His positions were so big that he could cause the price to move in the way he wanted by buying or selling massive amounts of his holdings in the last 30 minutes of trading on NYMEX, a move known as "smashing the close," federal regulators say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At one point, in the summer of 2006, Mr. Hunter, the 32-year-old trader, controlled up to 70 percent of the natural gas commodities on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) that were scheduled to supply companies and homes in November of last year and more than 40 percent of contracts for the entire winter season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this relates to the question of a piece of legislation that is entitled "Close the Enron Loophole" Act that Senator Levin and I have introduced. The fact is, in these energy futures, some of them are on regulated exchanges, but many of them are not. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission does not have the capability to see exactly what is happening in these futures contracts and in these over-the-counter or unrelated areas. We need, in my judgment, to pass legislation to try  to stop this rampant speculation of unregulated trading.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There needs to be a futures market. A futures market is very important to provide liquidity. But when a futures market becomes a gambling hall, and you start with investment banks and hedge funds, and all of these activities that have very little to do with the fundamentals of supply and demand, then there are very serious problems that must be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it could likely be the case that the price of oil will come down in a precipitous way as well. It does not seem that way at the moment. But it could because, clearly, this is a speculative bubble. In my judgment, the price is not justified by the fundamentals of supply and demand. Are we going to have a tightening of supplies in the future? Yes, I understand that. The Chinese want to drive 100 million more cars on their roads in the next 15 years. They are going to build these roads, they  are going to drive on them. Is that going to increase demand? Sure it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Russia wants to capture more oil. I am told they would love to find ways to impede the opportunity of oil and energy supplies coming from the Caspian Sea to the West. Does that potentially impact the price of oil? Sure it does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fact is this: At least at the moment, with the price of oil on the futures market, we have a situation in which the trading, in many cases, is completely unregulated and not transparent. We need to change that. There needs to be some regulation. This administration does not believe that. They have never believed in regulation. We understand what happened with respect to the crash of Enron and the bilking of tens of billions of dollars from consumers on the West Coast. Enron, in many ways,  was a criminal enterprise, and there are people now in jail as a result of it. The regulators sat on their hands, dead from the neck up, believing: No, no, no, no, this is the market working. It was not the market working. It was criminal activity, and people were hurt, a lot of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the oil futures market, there needs to be effective regulation. I am not alleging illegal activity here. I am saying, however, it is not healthy to have an amount of speculation in that market that is far beyond anything that would be reasonable, given the supply and demand of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have one additional topic I want to cover, but the majority leader is on the floor. I would be happy to yield to him.</paragraph>
