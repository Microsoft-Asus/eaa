    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to commend my friend Peter Groff on his historic achievement of becoming the first African American State Senate President in Colorado's history. Senator Groff becomes only the third African American Senate President in U.S. history. This momentous accomplishment is well-deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Groff is one of the most honorable, bright, and deliberate individuals I have ever had the pleasure to serve with. He embodies statesmanship and has earned the trust and esteem of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Groff's courageous and visionary approach to governing can be summed up in his own words: "To be bigger than the politics of the moment." I find it fitting that the man nicknamed "the conscience of the Colorado Senate" would be the first in our State's history to shatter this once seemingly impenetrable glass ceiling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said, "I don't measure America by its achievement, but by its potential." I can think of no better person to help Colorado achieve its potential than Peter Groff. He will serve Colorado with honor and distinction.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
