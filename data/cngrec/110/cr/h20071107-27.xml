    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last night big, rich tobacco companies killed health care in Oregon for little poor kids. Now we in Congress must and can do better for our entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Republican leaders refuse to allow bipartisan negotiators to reach a compromise that would give 10 million American children the health care they need and deserve. The Republican leaders' refusal to negotiate only highlights their continued opposition to health care for the children of low-income working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, President Bush also remains unmoved by the health care needs of our children. The President has routinely refused to meet with congressional leaders, even to discuss the children's health care insurance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While President Bush works against children's health care, Republicans and Democrats will continue to work together to identify a compromise that will afford health care to 10 million American children. A bipartisan majority of us realize just how important it is to ensure that children have access. The health care of the 10 million American children and over 100,000 children in Oregon is simply too important to ignore.</paragraph>
