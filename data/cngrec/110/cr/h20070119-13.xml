    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for too long the American people have been paying for the cost of corruption here in Washington, whether it be skyrocketing prices at the pump last summer, or spiraling prescription drug costs. Democrats vowed to wrestle power of this institution away from special interest lobbyists who have been running it for the last 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats began to restore faith in Congress when we reformed our rules to prevent the kind of lobbying scandals that have become commonplace during much of the past 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We then began to fix some of the laws that were written and passed in the dark of night. During the first 100 hours in power, we gave the Federal Government the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for American seniors, something that should have been done when the law was first passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, we repealed $14 billion in subsidies to big oil companies that simply don't need it right now. We have taken the savings and invested them in renewable fuels so that we can begin to end our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our first 100 hours are over, but we are only beginning to work on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
