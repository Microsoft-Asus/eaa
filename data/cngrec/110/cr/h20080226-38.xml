  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very happy to be here debating this bill to help public housing authorities across  this Nation. Let me start by thanking Chairman Barney Frank for his support on this bill and his leadership in the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me start by explaining why I introduced this bill. Shortly after I was sworn in, I received a letter from the Jersey City Housing Authority in my district. They told me they had laid off 34 employees bec ause of asset management. When I looked into this, I learned that Jersey City was not unique. Over 800 public housing authorities had their operating budgets cut because of the way asset management was implemented by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. At the same time,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew something had to be done. With the support of Chairman Frank, Chairwoman Waters, and others, I int roduced <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. You will note that the title indicates that the bill improves asset management. It does not, and I repeat, it does not put an end to asset management. That is because I feel strongly that the goals of the asset management are worthwhile. By making public housing authorities run more efficiently,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill simply mak es four improvements to the asset management rule. First, it requires renewed negotiations over the management fee. A little background in this is probably helpful. In 1998, Congress passed the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, which called on the Department to replace the old funding system with a new, more efficient system. In 2004, a negotiated rulemaking committee gathered to decide how to implement this new system known as asset management. One key piece</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, my bill reaffirms current  law by allowing public housing authorities to transfer funds between their operating fund and their capital fund. This provision prevents the Department from prohibiting such transfers. This flexibility is vital to agencies, particularly since the public housing program is underfunded. Housing authorities know best where they need funding, not Washington. There is wide agreement on this provision. In fact, this provision was included in the Consolidated Appropriations</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, my bill increases the exemption threshold from small to medium-sized public housing authorities. The Department recognized that small authorities with fewer than 250 units of housing would not benefit from the efficiencies of asset management. The final rule exempts public housing authorities with fewer than 250 units of housing from implementing asset management. My bill simply raises this threshold to 500 units. Agai n, there is little disagreement on raising the threshold. The Consolidated</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, my bill restates curr ent law in terms of tenant participation. It simply says that tenants should be allowed to participate in the decisions affecting their homes. It prohibits the Department from altering tenant participation rights, and it encourages public housing authorities to include tenants in discussion about asset management that directly affects their home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me end by talking about who supports this bill. We have received letters of support from the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, the Public Housin g Authorities Directors Association, the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, and the National Training and Information Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit these letters for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AND INFORMATION CENTER,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chicago, IL, February 7, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: The undersigned 150 democratic grassroots resident organizing groups and allies would like to convey our strong support for protecting the rights of public housing residents to organize, as delineated in <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. As the transition to a system of asset management is one of the most significant shifts facing the administration of public housing in many years, it is more important than ev er that public housing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April of 2007, the National Training &amp; Information Center (NTIC) submitted a letter to Congress endorsed by local, statewide, and national organizations in protest of recent attempts to undermine the efforts of resident and community organizations to participate in the decisions around public housing that impact their communities and their lives, One of those attempts was a notice by HUD o n March 1, 2007 to streamline the process to waive 24 CFR 964, which outlines the rights of residents</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NTIC network is of the perspective that residents must be central to the discourse around policies that impact them--both at the local and national level. Section 4 of this bill will ensure tha t the voices of public housing residents are not lost in the implementation of asset management. Over the past year, NTIC has brought together public housing residents and allies from 38 cities to identify the most pressing areas for reform of public housing policy. The right to organize and meaningful</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The undersigned 150 local, statewide, and national organizations would like to convey our support for the principles outlined in Section 4 of <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>. Namely, we feel strongly that residents should have a right to organize in public housing and should be meaningfully and substantively involved in the decisions that impact their lives--both at the local and national level. Specifically, it is critical that the rights bestowed by 24 CFR 964 not be undermined by the transition to asset m anagement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for listening to the voices of the people!</paragraph>

    <paragraph>AND REDEVELOPMENT OFFICIALS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, February 1, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Representative Sires: On behalf of the more than 22,000 members of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), I am pleased to join with our industry colleagues the Public Housing Authority Directors Association (PHADA) and the Council of Large Public Housing Agencies (CLPHA) in formally expressing our strong support for House passage of <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, "The Public Housing Asset Management and Impr ovement Act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill> contains provisions that will help ensure a responsible and practicable transition to asset management. The bill would establish a reasoned process for defining and determining management and related fees and a suitable transition period for implementing them. The bill also addresses concerns expressed by NAHRO and our industry colleagues with regard to the practicality and cost-effectiveness of asset management for local housing agencies with fewer than 500 public ho using</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally the legislation reaffirms current statute with respect to the right of residents to provide input and participate in the development of local agency policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAHRO maintains that the provisions contained in H</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We thank you for your leadership on this issue and stand ready to be of further assistance as appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Respectfully,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 30, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN FRANK: On behalf of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA), I am writing in support of <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007, and to urge passage of this sensible legislation by the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asset management is landmark program change now several years in the making. CLPHA members have made the commitment to transition to a flexible asset management syste m, a shift involving sweeping management and accounting changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Provisions in the legislation of most concern to our members are those relating to management and related fees and the prohibition on restriction of fungibility of capital fund amounts. The legislation allows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Housing agencies and HUD to have an expanded formal process by April 1, 2009, the basis of which is already established in the Public Housing Operating Fund Final Rule, enabling the negotiation of appropriate property management,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Housing agencies to use a portion of their Capital Fund grant towards eligible operating expenses. This provision was first established by Congress in 1996 and reinforced in the 2008 HUD appropriations bill in recognition of housing agencies' need for funding flexibility--a need which has only increased over time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We thank you for your leadership and support of public housing and look forwar d to working with you on passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sunia Zaterman,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NATIONAL HOUSING LAW PROJECT,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oakland, CA, February 25, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN SIRES: We are  writing to convey our support for <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act. The focus of our support is based upon the resident participation provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Housing Law Project (NHLP) is a 40 year old national housing law and advocacy center whose mission is to advance housing justice for poor people. NHLP's goals are to increase and preserve the supply of decent affordable housing, improve housing conditions for very low-income persons and households, expand and enforce l ow-income tenants' and homeowners' rights and increase housing opportunities for racial and ethnic minorities. In pursuit of these goals, NHLP provides support through</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HUD and public housing agencies (PHAs) are currently engaged in the very substantial effort of transitioni ng to and implementing asset management. This effort is having a substantial impact at the local level. PHAs that never applied for operating subsidies are now doing so. Other PHAs are experiencing cuts in operating subsidies due to asset management and the new funding formula. All PHAs are making new staffing and program determinations because of the requirements of project-based management</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also critical that Congress recognize the rights of public housing residents to organized and represent their members. Previously, Congress recognized these rights for residents of other federally a ssisted but privately owned housing. See 12 U.S.C. 1715z-1b(4). It is important that Congress also recognized the same rights for the approximately 1.2 million public housing families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CATHERINE M. BISHOP,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 31,  2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Representative Sires: On behalf of its members, PHADA thanks you for your support of the public housing program and for your efforts to ensure the workability of public housing asset management. Asset management is a landmark program change now several years in the making. During this time, PHADA has advocated for a cost-effective and practicable transition to asset management; a transitio n that would also enable smaller housing agencies (for whom the transition to individual project</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2008 (<bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>) would authorize in statute recommendations long advocated for and broadly supported by PHADA's membership; recommendations that would accomplish this overall objective. PHADA is pleased to express its strong support for the passage of this</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill> will make possible the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. In 2009, housing agencies and HUD will have an expanded formal process, the basis of which is already established in the Public Housing Operating Fund Final Rule, enabling the negotiation of appropriate property management, bookkeeping and asset management fees. Further, once arrived upon, execution of those fees would commence in 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. Small housing authoriti es that own and manage between 250 to 500 public housing units, 12 percent of all agencies, will gain regulatory relief in that the transition to asset management will be optional for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. The legislation upholds current statute by which public housing residents may organize and participate in the development of policies at public housing agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PHADA believes these simple provisions will mitigate implementation impediments broadly identified by its members and would  provide flexibility critical to housing agencies' survival in a time of dwindling resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PHADA views these items as being essential to the fair, efficient and effective implementation of asset management as currently defined by HUD. It welcomes the opportunity to continue to work with the Department and Members of Congress to ensure that the administration of asset management is handled in a responsible manner going forward. Thank you for the opportunity to express these views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Respectfully,</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>My office has taken calls from public housing authorities across this Nation, small, large, urban, and rural authorities supporting this bill, and I hope that Members will support this bill. Please make a difference for public housing residents and public housing authorities by easing their regulatory burd en. Vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. The bill makes several changes to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Public Housing Agency Asset Management Final Rule. And what I'd like to do, rather than reading a lengthy statement, is just sort</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without question, there's been a great deal of good work and good faith that's been put in on this bill, but I think that there's a couple of key points that just fall a little bit short, and I think we can do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first is, the exemption of so many public housing authorities from the asset management mandate. And that's something that's a good thing, on balance. Asset management says that if you've got unit A and unit B and unit C of public ho using, then we're going to determine the cost of unit A, the cost of unit B, and the cost of unit C, and that we're not going to mix all these things up together and act as if each individual one isn't responsible for an individual cost. Asset management is a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing that is actual ly a bigger concern to me, is section 2 of the bill, and it relates to management and related fees. Let me just read part of the language that this House is being asked to vote on. It says, "The Secretary shall not impose any," and that's the operative word, Mr. Chairman, "any restriction or limitation on the amount of management and related fees with respect to a public housing project if the fee is determined to be reasonable by the Public Housing Agency unless,"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, under this bill, as amended, under this bill, it's going to be the very entity that's going to be the beneficiary of that fee. So we're essentially saying to the fox, Why don't you guard the henhouse? Why don't you decide what your fee is going to be, and you simply send the bill to the taxpayer, a nd that's the bill that's going to be paid? I think that's unreasonable. I think that common sense says, no, no, no. Common sense says, there's going to be someone else that determines reasonableness</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this allows for the diversion of capital funds, Mr. Chairman. You know, there's always a natural tension, right, between capita l funds and operating funds, and we hear that all the time. There is no shortage of national attention and national conversation and national concern about the atrophying of our capital, the atrophying of our infrastructure. And what we ought not be doing is creating more fungibility, in other words, more pressure to take money and divert precious capital money</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady from California (Ms. Waters).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am indeed honored to be an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, the Pu blic Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007; and I want to thank Mr. Sires and Chairman Frank for their dedication and commitment to resolving this, at times, perplexing and confusing process known as asset management to which our public housing agencies have been struggling to adapt for several years now. This struggle has been made all the worse by the Department of Housing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we can all agree that public housing agencies can be better at managing our public housing resources and that asset management has the potential to improve how public housing is managed nationwide. However, in examining the issues behind the implementation of asset management, it has become clear that HUD's one-size-fits-all approach simply won't work. In addition, the Department's willful disregard of existing statute as a part of the i mplementation is eroding the trust of housing agencies'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the Department's actions and the need to proceed with asset management, my friend from New Jersey who introduced this bill, <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, maintains and respects the negotiated rulemaking agreed to by all parties, housing agencies, their industry representatives and HUD and still requires housing agencies to convert to asset management by 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the bill settles three outstanding issu es that have slowed the implementation of asset management: number one, the amount of management fees; number two, the ability of housing agencies to use a portion of their capital funds while operating expenses as allowed under statute; and number three, the kind of housing agencies that must convert to asset management. These are all critical issues that must be decided before 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill> would require negotiated rulemaking to settle the issue of management fees. The fees that the Department is at tempting to impose on housing agencies are, in many cases, insufficient and will not meet the needs of housing agencies that have been historically underfunded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, these fees appear to have been arrived at in an arbitrary manner. Negotiated rulemaking on the subject of management fees would allow the Nation's housing managers to work with HUD to determine a reasonable fee for managing public housing. Because the date for full implementation of asset management would stay the same, negotiated r ulemaking would not delay or stall conversion to asset management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the use of capital funds for operating expenses, the statute is very clear. Housing agencies have the ability to move 20 percent of their capital funds to their operating fund. However, in its guidance, the Department has disregarded this plain-as-day statute and has limited capital fund fungibility to 10 percent. The bill simply asserts what is already in law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Large housing agencies will benefit the most from asset management due</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the bill makes sure that asset management does not stifle tenant participation and resident organization. Public housing residents are very concerned about how  asset management will impact their ability to participate and to organize. The bill ensures that the ability of residents to remain involved and to be represented is not impinged upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this bill does not undo, reverse, or undermine the original negotiated rulemaking between housing agencies and the Department. It simply settles four outstanding issues so that asset management can move forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to my friend from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman Frank and co mmend Chairwoman Waters and my colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Albio Sires, for bringing to the floor this very important legislation. This is the most significant administrative transformation, Mr. Chairman, in 30 years dealing with all of the public housing authorities throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, developed with the input of public housing agencies, administrators and tenants, is a commonsense measure that provides flexibility to the Nation's public housing authorities as  they transition to asset management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say to my friend from Illinois, the points that you bring up are salient, but it doesn't work here, and I will tell you why. <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill> was included as part of <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which the President signed on December 26, 2007. It's already law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the Consolidated Appropriations Act included the provision to allow flexible funding between the capital and operating funds. It also expanded the exemption from im plementing asset management from public housing authorities with less than 250 units to public housing authorities with less than 400 units. This legislation that is before us today increases that threshold to 500 units. So what we are taking is something already in the law and expanding it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill> would also be permanent whereas the Consolidated Appropriations Act would only put provisions in place for the year 2008. I ask that that be considered, and I think it is a very important part of what we a re debating today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asset management is an efficient administrative style that allows public housing authorities to manage each individual housing development on a project-level basis as opposed to managing developments on an agency-wide basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While most stakeholders support the idea of asset management, they believe that HUD has implemented its inflexibility. For example, HUD has mandated that public housing authorities  demonstrate compliance. So this is not a willy-nilly situation here. Thi s is something you have to comply to the law. New rules will be established by 2011, which the PHAs believe is too soon. You have to get these public housing authorities that have been operating, many</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need time to issue timely and complete guidance on these new regulations causing some PHAs to lose funding and staff. I don't think any of us want that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During t his time of declining resources for public housing, when is the last time we built public housing? When is the last time we built public housing for seniors at a time when we know what is going on out there with people losing homes? When is the last time we have provided public housing?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So during this time of declining resources for public housing, it is imperative that we provide them with the flexibility they need to use their funds as they see fit. This legislation requires new negotiated rulemaking  to begin in 2009 to ensure that housing authorities are funded according to an accurate funding formula and allows the public housing authorities the flexibility to move small amounts of funding from capital to operating funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, this legislation exempts small public housing authorities from asset management, as they generally will see no economic or efficiency improvements from its implementation and ensure that the PHAs involve tenants in every decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this bill makes real prac tical changes that will truly benefit our public housing agencies as they implement asset management. I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I commend the sponsors of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the tone of the discussion this afternoon very, ver y much. I just want to point out and really ask the House if you notice something, and at the beginning of my remarks, I put out, essentially as a challenge, this concern that I have of this language: the secretary shall not impose any restriction or limitation on the amount of management and related fees. Nothing: no restrictions, no authority, completely stripped so that there is nobody that has the ability that can come in and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the gentleman from New Jersey, the previous speaker, mentioned the fungibility argument. I accept that as an argument. I just don't think it is a good idea. I don't think that something that's in an appropriations bill, just because it's a bad idea, that it needs the House's imprimatur once again. That's going to expire at</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So just in summary, what we are being asked to do today is essentially to limit down the amount of public housing authorities that would be under asset management to only 12 percent of the public housing authorities in the United States. Only 12 percent of them would be subject to asset management if this bill is enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think those are sufficient numbers to say, you know what, I think we can do better. Those are sufficient reasons, sufficien t arguments that would suggest that we can do better. This should go back to the drawing board. And I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, just in closing I would like to say that there is oversight, and the 20 percent that we are talking about is just increasing 10 percent because already they have the ability to move 10 percent. With all of the costs, all of the increases and the underfunding of these housing autho rities, I think this is reasonable.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This manager's amendment covers two different aspects of the bill. The first part addresses compliance with section 2 of the bi ll. Section 2 grants agencies that lost funding because of asset management to walk out of the funding agreement.

However, the Department recently announced that any agency compliant with this provision of the bill will be deemed as noncompliant with</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Members, I t hink that this amendment is well in order. First of all, I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank, and also Mr. Sires, who has been a leader in this, my friend from New Jersey, and also Chairwoman Waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply, on page 3, line 23, gives those individuals who find themselves in the middle of a dispute between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a local housing authority, when that particular local housing authority falls into r eceivership, all agreements that have been agreed upon as it relates to tenants and that housing authority should be honored when that takes place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Case in point: In south Florida we were awarded a HOPE VI grant, and the housing authority failed the residents in being able to implement that grant, and then the residents and housing authority came together for the better good to make sure there weren't a number of homeless individuals, and those agreements ended up going south. And I think there are othe r communities that will be going through this in the very near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am offering this amendment, and hopefully the Members will accept this amendment in good faith and it will help us move forward as we look at these situations in the future.</paragraph>

  <chair/>
  <chair>Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS and Mr. PENCE changed their vote from "aye" to "no."</chair>
  <chair>So the amendment was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the Committee rises.</chair>
  <chair>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Tauscher) having assumed the chair, Mr. Serrano, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State o f the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>) to improve the Operating Fund for public housing of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, pursuant to House Resolution 974, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the previous question is ordered.</chair>
  <chair>Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole?</chair>
  <chair>The amendment was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>
  <chair> Is the gentleman opp osed to the bill?</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve a point of order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> A point of order is reserved.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative> Mr. SMITH of Texas moves to recommit the bill, <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill>, to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the text of the bill <bill type="h" number="3773">H.R. 3773</bill> as passed by the Senate on February 12, 2008.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;POINT OF ORDER</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I make a point of order that the amendment is not germane to the bill. The bill <bill type="h" number="3773">H.R. 3773</bill> has nothing to do with the asset management bill under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Yes, I do, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, once again, the Democratic majority is  insisting on a procedural objection to block consideration of the Senate-passed FISA modernization bill. This motion to recommit adds the bipartisan bill passed 2 weeks ago by the Senate, 68-29.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Mrs. Bachmann move s to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="3521">H.R. 3521</bill> to the Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report the same back to the House promptly with the following instructions:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Page 2, after line 17, insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall not accept as reasonable any fees for enforcing any provision of a dwelling lease agreement or other similar agreement that requires the registration of or prohibits the possession of any firearm that is possessed by an individual f or his or her personal protection or for sport the possession of which is not prohibited, or the registration of which is not required, by existing law.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our Founding Fathers wrote our Nation's fundament al values of freedom and representative government into our Constitution. This includes the people's second amendment right to keep and bear arms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens who are in compliance with the law should not have those rights taken away, including those who live in public housing. Yet, public housing authorities, including the one right here in our Nation's Capital, are telling residents that in order to be a resident of public housing, you must give up your second amendment rights. You must give up your right</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quote from the January 2008 dwelling lease agreement for D.C.: "Lessee and all Others are required to comply with the following use restrictions and requirements ..... To refrain from storing, maintaining, using, distributing, purchasing or selling any type of firearms or ammunition on the Leased Premises or the Development, whether registered or unregistered."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, Madam Speaker, e ven if you comply with all the laws of the District of Columbia related to gun ownership, you are prohibited from owning a gun if you are a resident of public housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about law-abiding citizens, not criminals. Criminals are already largely prohibited from residing in public housing. Residents of public housing share the same legal rights to possess lawful property and to take measures to defend their lives as do homeowners who control their estate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The D.C. policy clearly discriminates</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than 2 weeks ago, 250 Members of this House of Representatives, including 65 Members of the majority, who said there shouldn't be any gun ban here in the District of Columbia signed a bipartisan amicus curiae brief in District of Columbia v. Heller, which said it is a case that currently is before the United States Supreme Court which questions the constitutionality of the D.C. gun ban. The amicus brief  supports the ruling by a lower Federal appeals court which upheld the constitutional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to refresh my colleagues one more time, one notable line from the brief states, and I quote, "Had Americans in 1787 been told that the Federal Government could ban the frontiersman in his log cabin, or the city merchant living above his store, from keeping firearms to provide for and protect himself and his family, it is hard to imagine that the Constitution would</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The D.C. public housing restriction goes even further than the D.C. gun ban in question in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we must assure that Americans living in public housing have their personal right to possess firearms for hunting or self-defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to recommit is simple. It clarifies that public housing authorities that participate in the asset management program cannot prohibit their law-abiding tenants from possessing firearms and ammunition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I a sk my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MRS.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise almost in disbelief that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, led by Mrs. Bachmann, would dare bring to this floor a motion that basically would say to us that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We own these public housing authorities. The people who are here live under the rules that we develop for living in public housing. We are confronted with the problem in America, and that problem is, unfortunately, and painfully, we have poor people who are isolated, and they find their power and their strength in the gun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are far too many guns raging every night in America in public housing authorities, whether it is Los Ange les or New York or down south.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What you find are young jobless men in gangs who shoot throughout the  night where people are ducking under their beds, afraid to open their doors. Many of these public housing authorities are on main thoroughfares, next to shopping centers, on your way to the airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These bullets don't limit themselves to inside these public housing authorities. They could end up shooting people who are passing through the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand, perhaps, the argument that one wo uld make about constitutional rights. While I disagree with that, I think it is foolhardy and foolish to talk about we don't have the authority to determine what happens on our property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are those in this room who would shout down public housing authorities and not give people a place to live at all, because they said there is too much violence, there is too much joblessness, there is too much violence. There are those of us who have worked for years not only to clean up these public housing author ities but to make sure that the people who live there are abiding by the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am in disbelief that anyone could believe it's all right to continue what is happening in America today in many of these public housing authorities where young people are dying. Of course we don't like it. Of course we are appalled at it. We are pained with it. But give me a break. All of us are much more responsible than this motion to recommit would have us believe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield to the gentleman from Maryland.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>There are Members on the opposite side of the aisle who would identify themselves as being law and order people, of wanting to get rid of guns and crime. Well, this is an opportunity to show where you stand. Do you stand with us to keep Americans safe? Do you stand with us to make the rules on Federal property, or are you going to vote us down?</paragraph>
