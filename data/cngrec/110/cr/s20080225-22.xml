  <narrative>IN MEMORY OF OFFICER RANDAL SIMMONS -- (Senate - February 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1116">S1116</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the city of Los Angeles and the nationwide law enforcement community has lost an exemplary leader. Officer Randal Simmons, a 27-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and 20-year member of the department's elite Special Weapons and Tactics Team, SWAT, is the first officer in the team's four-decade history to die in the line of duty. I would like to take a few moments to recognize Officer Randal Simmons' many important accomplishments and the tremendous  impact he made as a leader in both his personal and professional life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally from New York City, Simmons' family moved to southern California early in his life. He graduated from Fairfax High School in 1974 and then attended Washington State University where he studied criminology  and was a member of the University's football team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After college, Simmons returned to the city of Los Angeles and became a member of the Los Angeles Police Department. During his career, Simmons served in many high-crime areas where he worked to not only protect the local community but also to combat gang activity. His dedication to serving the residents of Los Angeles was well recognized when he earned the distinction of becoming a member of the department's elite SWAT Team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simmons was not only a leader to his fellow officers but also a highly respected leader in his community. Serving as an ordained minister, he was an active member of his church and helped to build a community gymnasium. He volunteered much of his time to lead a group ministry that served nearly 1,500 children and also found time to serve as coach for his son's football team. His presence in the community will truly be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring Officer Randal Simmons for his guidance and leadership in fighting to improve the lives of all Angelinos. He is survived by his wife Lisa and their two children, to whom I send my heartfelt condolence. Officer Simmons leaves a lasting legacy of caring and compassion that serves as a model to us all.</paragraph>
