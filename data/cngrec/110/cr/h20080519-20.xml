  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3323">H.R. 3323</bill>, introduced by our colleague from California, Congresswoman Lois Capps, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey all rights of the United States to the Goleta Water Distribution System to the Goleta Water District in Santa Barbara, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congresswoman Capps for her hard work on this important legislation, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3323">H.R. 3323</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of this bill. It's always a good thing when the Federal Government evaluates land it does not need, that has previously been owned by local municipalities or private individuals and takes steps to return that at no cost to the taxpayers. So I join with the gentlelady from Guam and my colleague from California, Lois Capps, in urging support for the return of this land to the Goleta Water District.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3323">H.R. 3323</bill>, the Goleta Water Distribution System Conveyance Act of 2007--a bill I introduced last year that would authorize the title transfer of a federally owned water distribution system in my congressional district from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Goleta Water District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Mr. RAHALL, and chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, Ms. NAPOLITANO, as well as the ranking members of the full Committee and Subcommittee for bringing <bill type="h" number="3323">H.R. 3323</bill> before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the legislation is to simplify the operation and maintenance of the District's water distribution system and eliminate unnecessary paperwork and consultation between the District and the Bureau.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Goleta Water District has operated and maintained the facilities proposed for transfer since the 1950s. They have worked through all requirements of the Bureau's title transfer process, including public meetings, fulfillment of their repayment obligations, completion of an environmental assessment, and compliance with all other applicable laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only step remaining to complete the process is an act of Congress enabling the Secretary of the Interior to transfer title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that the proposed transfer would apply only to lands and facilities associated with the District and would not affect the District's existing water service contract with the Santa Barbara County Water Agency nor the Federal government receipts from water deliveries under the contract. In addition, the proposed transfer does not envision any new physical modification or expansion of the service infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased the administration is supporting my legislation, which will allow the Bureau to focus its limited resources where they are needed most. In my view, this is an example of local problem-solving at its best. I commend the staff of the water district and the Bureau for their efforts to reach this agreement. I know that they have been working on this for several years now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to thank the Natural Resources Committee for supporting this bill, and urge its immediate passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3323">H.R. 3323</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>

  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.</chair>
