    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="5853">H.R. 5853</bill>, the Minute Man National Historical Park Boundary Revision Act, was introduced by our colleague from Massachusetts, the honorable Congresswoman Tsongas. This bill would modify the boundary of the Minute Man National Historical Park in Massachusetts to include the historic site of Barrett's Farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel James Barrett was a leading Revolutionary War patriot and military figure, and his farm in Concord played a significant role in the events leading up to the opening battles of the Revolutionary War at Lexington and Concord in April 1775.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2007 study from the National Park Service concluded that the boundary adjustment was important to ensure the protection of these nationally significant resources and values. And this bill enjoys extensive public support, as well as the support of the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Representative Tsongas for her leadership on this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support passage of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be speaking on behalf of <bill type="h" number="5853">H.R. 5853</bill>, the Minute Man National Historical Park Act, which extends the boundary of the Minute Man National Park located in Concord, Massachusetts, to include historic Barrett's Farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a simple, noncontroversial boundary adjustment of 67 acres to the current national park and enjoys the support of the National Park Service and Save Our Heritage, the nonprofit organization which currently owns Barrett's Farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It may seem like small change, but the preservation of such a significant site is monumentally important to the history of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barrett's Farm is the former home of Colonel James Barrett, the commander of the Middlesex militia during the Revolutionary War. It was also used to store the militia's munitions in the weeks preceding the Battle of Concord and Lexington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 19, 1775, General Thomas Gage, the commander of all British forces in North America, ordered 700 of his troops to march to Barrett's Farm and destroy these supplies. Our colonial militia learned of the British plot in advance, and Paul Revere made his famous ride, calling his fellow countrymen to arms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time the British reached Barrett's Farm, the colonial militia's guns were safely hidden, and Colonel Barrett had strategically positioned the militia to strike the British Army. Barrett's militia confronted British soldiers at the North Bridge in Concord, where the infamous "shot heard 'round the world" was fired, launching our war for independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the hard work and ongoing efforts of the nonprofit group, Save Our Heritage, Barrett's Farm has been kept in excellent condition. Private donations throughout the years have been used for its upkeep and restoration. Our country is indebted to these committed people for preserving this national historical treasure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is time for this important location to be part of the larger Minute Man National Park so that the considerable resources and expertise of the National Park Service can be put towards the restoration and permanent preservation of this remarkable piece of Massachusetts' rich revolutionary history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will also enable park visitors to have a more complete understanding of how and where our American Revolution began.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the House to pass this bill to protect Colonel James Barrett's Farm so that current and future generations can learn about the role this site played in the birth of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Chairman Grijalva for their leadership on this bill, and I would also like to thank all the cosponsors of this bill for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues today to vote for this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have no other requests for speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I again urge Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5853">H.R. 5853</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
