    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to share with my colleagues the winners of the 2006-2007 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Farm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay contest for eighth grade students in my home State. The purpose of this contest is to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the importance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently craft an essay responding to the assigned theme. I, along with my friends at the Indiana Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau Insurance Companies, am pleased with the annual response to this contest and the quality of the essays received  over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Courtney Larson, of Bartholomew County, and Chad VanLiew, of Jackson County, as winners of this year's contest. I ask that the complete text of their respective essays be printed in the Record. Likewise, I would like to include the names of all of the district and county winners of the 2006-2007 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Farm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth Essay Contest.</paragraph>
