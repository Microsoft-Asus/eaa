    <paragraph>Madam President, reserving the right to object, the ranking member, Senator Specter, wishes a block of time for Senators to speak.

    <paragraph>Madam President, the hue and cry of the Republicans is that we do more judges. We wanted to do more judges. I say to my friend, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we have lots of time on the floor. The American public sees it all the time, where we are in quorum calls. Anytime we are in a quorum call, with rare exception, Senators can come and ask that it be called off and proceed to speak for as long as they want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a number of things we need to do today. There is going to be a conversation on energy. And I recognize there are some problems with the economy. Housing is a difficult problem. Energy is a difficult problem, as are gas prices and global warming, education. But I am telling you, I cannot ever remember going home and someone coming up to me and saying: Could you guys do some more judges? We need to take care of this judges problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Lott said when he was the majority leader, and I am repeating my friend Senator Lott's statement: Frankly, judges are not a big issue as it relates to the other problems we are facing here in America today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say, if the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee wants to come and talk for 3 hours, he can do it on his own time. There is lots of time here. We have made an offer giving reasonable time to confirm two judges, and we are happy to do that. An hour is certainly more time than is normally taken. And if Senator Specter wants to come and talk about the plight of the American judiciary system, he can do that, but I wish to get these two judges approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If they are not going to agree to that, we are not going to do the judges. It is the Republicans' call.</paragraph>
