    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="1853">H.R. 1853</bill>, the Jose Medina Veterans Affairs Police Training Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, more than 1.5 million U.S. troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and according to an Army study, 20 percent are showing signs of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But surprisingly, most VA police officers do not receive any training on how to deal with patients suffering from mental illness. That is why we must prepare VA law enforcement officers to deal with the tens of thousands of veterans returning from Iraq that are expected to utilize VA medical centers for mental health  services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1853">H.R. 1853</bill>, the Jose Medina Veterans Affairs Police Training Act, will ensure that our veterans are treated with dignity and respect when they seek treatment at VA facilities. Veterans' mental health needs should be one of this Congress' top priorities, and I urge your support.</paragraph>
