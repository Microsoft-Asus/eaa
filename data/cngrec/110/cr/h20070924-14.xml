  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas, since the beginning of the 20th century, hunters and fishermen of the United States have been among the most vocal supporters of the scientific management of wildlife and conservation of the natural environment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President Theodore Roosevelt, who was himself a hunter, fisherman, and conservationist, called throughout his Presidency for laws to promote wildlife conservation and to provide lands for recreation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in June 1971, Senator Thomas McIntyre of New Hampshire and Representative Robert Sikes of Florida sponsored a joint resolution calling for the celebration of "National Hunting and Fishing Day" on the fourth Saturday of every September;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in 2006, an estimated 42,500,000 individuals in the United States participated in hunting or fishing activities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in 2006, hunters and fishermen made a significant contribution to the economy of the United States by spending nearly $75,000,000,000 on hunting and fishing activities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas hunters and fishermen recognize the importance of natural resources to the character, heritage, and future of the United States, and work to protect and conserve those resources; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the fourth Saturday of September would be an appropriate day to as celebrate National Hunting and Fishing Day: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) there should be established a day known as National Hunting and Fishing Day; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the President should issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe such a day with appropriate programs and activities; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) encourages participation in hunting and fishing; and</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 634, as amended, recognizes the contributions that American sportsmen and -women make in promoting wildlife conservation. The resolution calls on the President to issue a proclamation supporting National Hunting and Fishing Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are an estimated 42.5 million Americans who hunt and fish, according to the most recent survey conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Aside from supporting efforts to protect our natural environment, these men and women also contribute to our economy. They spent $75 billion in 2006 on hunting and fishing activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Congresswoman Gillibrand from New York for introducing this resolution, and I urge adoption of the resolution, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let me thank and commend the gentleman from West Virginia for expeditiously bringing this bill to the floor. I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="634">H. Res. 634</bill>, urging the establishment of a National Hunting and Fishing Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the founding of our Republic more than 230 years ago, hunting and fishing have been woven into the very fabric of our cultural heritage. There is no question that sportsmen are among the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and the conservation of our natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, without the billions of dollars that have been paid by sportsmen in excise taxes and duck stamp fees, it is likely that President Theodore Roosevelt's vision of a national wildlife refuge system would never have been achieved. Today, that system is comprised of more than 96 million acres, and more than 90 percent of those Federal lands are open to the 42 million Americans who hunt and fish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appropriate that we designate a National Hunting and Fishing Day and that we celebrate on October 9, the 10th anniversary of the National Wildlife Improvement Act of 1997. This historic law, sponsored by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and myself, has the fundamental purpose of working to ensure that the American people have the finest refuge system in the world and the ability to hunt and fish on lands they largely purchased with their hard-earned dollars. It is achieving  that goal that I believe is very, very important.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of House Resolution 634, encouraging participation in hunting and fishing activities and supporting the goals and ideals of National Hunting and Fishing Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past weekend Americans all over our great Nation celebrated National Hunting and Fishing Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1971, Senator Thomas McIntyre of New Hampshire and Representative Bob Sikes of Florida introduced a joint resolution authorizing National Hunting and Fishing Day on the fourth Saturday of September. In 1972, President Richard Nixon signed the first proclamation recognizing National Hunting and Fishing Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-five years later, thousands of events have taken place at hunting clubs and sportsmen's stores nationwide, bringing communities together in a grass-roots effort to promote outdoor activities and conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe that we, the United States Congress, should highlight these historic national pastimes by recognizing the contributions that hunters and fishermen have on America's rich culture, and encouraging participation in hunting and fishing as a way to promote family values, environmental conservation, and stewardship of our national resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, over 45 million Americans take part in these traditions. Many of these sportsmen and -women live in my district in upstate New York. When I hold a town hall meeting in the Hudson Valley, constituents tell me about the economic impact that these sports bring to our rural communities. I also hear from them about the need for strong conservation policies so that they may continue the tradition of sportsmanship in their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the folks that I have had the opportunity to speak with have lived all of their lives in New York's rural communities and view hunting and fishing not only as a pastime, but also a reflection of upstate New York's historic character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One week from today, turkey season will begin in upstate New York. Every year my mother and brother are among the very first in the woods when the season begins. My mother takes great pride in her ability to shoot a turkey for our Thanksgiving dinner every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now have the honor to represent over a dozen hunting wildlife management areas in three of New York State's environmental conservation regions. Nearly 700,000 New Yorkers participate in hunting and fishing each year and contribute extensively to our local and national economy through licensing, educational courses, and equipment purchases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The promotion of hunting and fishing activities coincides with environmental stewardship. Hunters and fishermen were among the first to call for policies to protect our environment and, to this day, continue to advocate for land protection and preservation efforts to maintain our wildlife and environment for our future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to encourage all Americans to get into the outdoors and enjoy all that God has provided us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for their support of this important resolution.</paragraph>
