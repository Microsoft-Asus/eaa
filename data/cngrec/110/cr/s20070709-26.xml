  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration tomorrow of Senator Webb's amendment No. 2012, that the second-degree amendment be withdrawn and there be 4 hours for debate equally divided in the usual form on that amendment, and that at the conclusion or yielding back of that 4 hours, the Senate vote, without intervening action, on the Webb amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, I say to my good friend the majority leader, this amendment was just laid down a couple hours ago. The chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee were not even here today. The ranking member will be here tomorrow. He has not even had an opportunity to make his opening statement. We wish to offer a side by side, probably to be offered by Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the committee. I was hoping we might  be able to enter into a consent agreement that gave us a chance for an alternative, which is frequently the way these things are handled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bearing that in mind, Mr. President, I am constrained to object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my friend has stated he would object to 4 hours, and I assume the same answer would be to 6 hours or 8 hours; is that right, I say to my friend.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend the majority leader, yes, at the moment. I am hopeful we can work out an agreement under which we could have a side by side, which is the way these things are often done in the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I understand that. Mr. President, what I suggest then is this: Senator Levin has been here all day. He didn't give his opening statement because he was occupied doing other business. He is here now. He was here all today in the Senate. I talked with him earlier this morning. What I suggest then is we get an agreement that if, in fact, I file cloture tomorrow, we can have a cloture vote on Wednesday. That way we wouldn't do it tonight. We will work with the minority leader.  I think there is a strong possibility we could do side by sides. We wouldn't lose anything by waiting until tomorrow to see if we can work out some agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I am asking is that rather than my filing cloture tonight, hopefully I won't have to do it tomorrow, but if I did on this amendment, rather than waiting until Thursday to vote on it, could I have an agreement from my  friend that we would vote on the cloture motion on Wednesday rather than Thursday?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say to my friend the majority leader, I think that is fine. Just a suggestion: If we go down that path of trying to get cloture on every single amendment, if cloture is invoked, then it would further delay completion of the bill potentially by somebody insisting on using postcloture time. We have no desire to make it difficult to get through this bill. We would, however, like to have votes on our amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the better way to proceed, as the majority leader has suggested, is to see if we can come to agreement on amendments and side by sides and move the process along, which sounds to me is what the majority leader is suggesting, and that is fine with me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is fine. What we will do, Mr. President, is hopefully not have to file cloture on this amendment. If we do, we will have a cloture vote on Wednesday. I feel confident we can work something out. We will certainly do our best on this side. Senator Levin is here. He is easy to work with, as is Senator Warner.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the cloture vote taking place on Wednesday?</chair>
  <chair>Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
