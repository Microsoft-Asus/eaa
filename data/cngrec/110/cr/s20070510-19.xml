    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to one of the top companies in the Nation and one that calls Arkansas home, Murphy Oil. In the May 2007 issue of Reader's Digest, Murphy Oil was named one of "America's 100 Best" in recognition of the El Dorado Promise scholarship program. Reader's Digest called the program the "Best Class Act" and nothing could be more true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>El Dorado Promise was created through a $50 million gift from Murphy Oil Company. The advent of the program guarantees that all local high school graduates in the El Dorado community will be able to go to college. To be eligible for the program, students must, at minimum, graduate from El Dorado High School, live in the school district, and attend El Dorado High between the 9th and 12th grades. Depending on how long a student has lived in the school district, eligible students will receive tuition  and mandatory fees assistance for up to 5 years and equal to the highest yearly rate charged by an Arkansas public university. Students must enroll in a community college or a 4-year university--public or private, in Arkansas or out of State--and maintain a 2.0 grade point average to remain eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a gift this is for this South Arkansas community and the families that live there. According to the Washington Post, it is one of the most generous scholarship programs in the Nation. When the program was announced in January at a school assembly, many in attendance were brought to tears.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Claiborne Deming, the president and CEO of Murphy Oil, and the Murphy Oil board of directors for their vision and investment in the children of El Dorado. The commitment they are making to their community will provide wonderful opportunities for many Arkansas families. Murphy Oil's unselfish gift also will elevate the lives of so many young people and allow them to fully participate in our global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many colleges are offering to participate in the program, and El Dorado Promise is already sparking interest as other communities attempt to find ways to offer similar programs. I am also hopeful that this scholarship program will set an example for other corporate citizens to make investments in their communities. It can go beyond dollars and cents, too. The donation of technology or even time in the form of mentoring programs can have a meaningful impact on students and communities in ways  that cannot be measured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education is a national investment in our most precious resource, our children. The knowledge and training they receive will provide them with the tools they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. The Nation's ability to lead responsibility in the world, to effectively confront emerging threats, and to complete in the global economy will depend on providing all our future leaders with a quality education. The El Dorado Promise is a quality investment in those children who will, no  doubt, reap Murphy Oil its greatest return for years to come.</paragraph>
