    <paragraph>Mr. President, this spring, the new community health center in Burlington, IA, officially opened for business. Having secured funding for the center and attended the groundbreaking ceremony last June, I know how important this health care facility is to Burlington and the surrounding communities. At long last, Des Moines County has a permanent, unified medical and dental clinic, which has been sorely needed for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a truly unique community health center. It is housed on the grounds of Southeastern Community College, and there is an agreement between the CHC board and the community college to allow nursing and health aide students to do some of their training in the center. This gives the center an edge in recruiting staff, and it gives students hands-on training opportunities right there on campus. Clearly, this is a win-win-win arrangement for the center, for the community college, and for the  entire Burlington community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute Ron Kemp and others who had the vision to create this new community health center, and the persistence to transform their vision into bricks and mortar. The facility is welcoming, modern, and well-equipped. The staff members are truly an inspiration. They have a special passion for their work, and take pride in the fact that they are providing first-rate health care to underserved communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used to say that "Life's most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?" The staff members at the community health centers of Southeast Iowa have answered that question in powerful ways. They have committed themselves to providing high-quality health care to all comers, regardless of ability to pay. All are welcomed equally. All are served with professionalism and excellence. As chair of the Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee,  I am 100 percent committed to securing appropriate funding for community health centers all across America. One thing I know for certain: Every dollar Congress appropriates for centers like the one in Burlington is a dollar spent wisely and frugally. It never ceases to amaze me how their staff members are able to do so much--and to serve so many people--with such limited resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I dare say that no one in the health care profession faces greater challenges than those who choose to work in community health centers. These challenges include chronic illness, cultural and linguistic differences, geographical barriers, and homelessness, to name just a few. Nothing stops these dedicated professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And one more thing: community health centers have a well-deserved reputation for caring and kindness. They offer a direct and personal style of health care. They follow up. They care about prevention and wellness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am deeply grateful to Executive Director Ron Kemp, to President Beverly Simone of Southeastern Community College, to the center's dedicated board members, to Ted Boesen, executive director of the Iowa/Nebraska Primary Care Association, and to all the other people who made this new facility possible. They work their hearts out to provide the very best health care to some of our most needy citizens. I deeply appreciate their passion, their compassion, and their dedication to public service.</paragraph>
