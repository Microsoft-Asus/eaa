    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize City of North Miami Chief of Police, Linda Loizzo. Linda is a true trailblazer. She has served the North Miami Police Department for more than 33 years in a number of capacities: deputy chief, assistant chief of operations, major in charge of administrative services, commander in charge of the investigative division, and supervisor of several special support services units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linda was the first woman promoted to the rank of sergeant, the first woman promoted to rank of lieutenant and major, and the first woman promoted to the rank of chief of police for the North Miami Beach Police Department. Chief Loizzo not only broke down walls in a male-dominated profession, but she also shattered and crumbled stereotypes for women in all professions, and particularly those in law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Chief Loizzo on her retirement and thank her for her dedicated service to our community.</paragraph>
