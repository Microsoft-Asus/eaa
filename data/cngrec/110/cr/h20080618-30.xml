  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is hardly a middle-class soul in our country who has not been impacted by this terrible economy. With 326,000 jobs lost, millions of Americans may lose their homes and their health care. All this as the price of food soars and the price of gas passes $4 a gallon and wages are stagnant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we should invent a new word similar to stagflation that also includes gas and food. May I suggest "stagasfoodlation" to describe this terrible economy. Millions of men, women and children are caught up in an economic perfect storm not of their making where every avenue seems cut off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we will have the opportunity to vote for an extension of unemployment insurance to help these American families. Republicans should not try to block this last lifeline for these families.</paragraph>
