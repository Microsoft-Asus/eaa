    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss the Fifth Annual Congressional Tri-Caucus Minority Health Summit which will be held this weekend in San Diego.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hosted by the Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County, the event is an opportunity for Members of Congress to learn from health experts, grass roots advocates and innovative solutions and address health disparities in communities of color.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud that 11 Members from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Black Caucus and Asian Caucus will join me and health advocates in San Diego. We're prepared to discuss issues such as expanding the SCHIP program, HIV and AIDS, homelessness, foster care, border health and veterans care, along with that discussing chronic illnesses that face many communities of color that are low income and disadvantaged</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why my Tri-Caucus colleagues and I recently introduced <bill type="h" number="3014">H.R. 3014</bill>, the Health Equity and Accountability Act, a comprehensive bipartisan legislation which addresses health care disparities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair of the Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Health and the Environment, I look forward to this event and bringing a new direction to this Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
