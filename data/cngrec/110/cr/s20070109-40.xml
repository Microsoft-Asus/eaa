    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have had a good day today, a lot of work has been done. I commend the distinguished Senator, who is still on the floor, for being such a good manager. Her assignment as chairman of the Rules Committee comes at a very opportune time for us and a burdensome time for her. There is so much the Rules Committee is going to be required to do in the next 2 years, not the least of which is some matters that will be spun off from this bill, including campaign finance reform,  which I have spoken with Senator McConnell about. I think he agrees that all matters relating to campaign finance reform should be referred to the Rules Committee and other committees that feel they have any jurisdiction. But the principal responsibility will be with Rules. We have to have extensive hearings on campaign finance reform, dealing with a broad range of issues--foundations, 527s, and all kinds of other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a good day. I applaud the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, for her work.</paragraph>
