  <narrative>REPUBLICANS' ENERGY SOLUTION IS WORKING FOR BIG OIL BUT NOT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6580]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when the President took office, gasoline cost less than $1.50 a gallon, and a barrel of oil was selling for $30. So they had a planning meeting down at the White House, and gas has jumped to $4.50 a gallon and oil is nearly $150 a barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these facts, the President would like the American people to believe that he has proposed a credible  new plan to lower energy prices, but consider this: The President's invasion of Iraq and tacit military threats to Iran have destabilized the Middle East and driven oil prices out of control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Oil has leases, access, and decades to drill on millions of acres on the Continental Shelf, but they choose instead to drill down into the wallets of the American people. Oil companies are already exploring today. They're exploring the upper limits of their stock prices by using their billions in profits to buy back stock, not to reinvest in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still don't know what the Vice President's secret meeting with the industry was when gas prices were $1.50 a gallon, but it sure looks like it's working for the oil companies, but it isn't working for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've got a plan, and we will propose it and bring it out here on the floor.</paragraph>
