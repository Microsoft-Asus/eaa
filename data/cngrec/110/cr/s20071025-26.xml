    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to a group of 94 World War II veterans from Louisiana that is making its way to Washington this weekend. Here the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iwo Jima memorials as well as Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trip to the Nation's Capital this Saturday is being sponsored by a group in Lafayette, LA, called Louisiana HonorAir. The organization is honoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them a chance to see the memorials dedicated to their service. So far this year, there have been three trips to these Washington memorials and two more are planned, including this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World War II was the deadliest conflict in our history. More than 60 million people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, and more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the long war.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>One of our veterans traveling for his first time to Washington is Frank Menard from Lafayette.

He participated in many battles with the Nazis during his 3 years in Europe, including the Battle of Normandy, where an enemy artillery shell struck his truck,  and the Battle of the Bulge, which severely crippled German forces. His French and German language skills helped him gather intelligence about enemy plans. During the Battle of the Bulge, he took a pregnant Belgian woman whose toes had been shot off by</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in honoring Frank Menard, the other 93 Louisiana heroes we welcome to Washington this weekend and Louisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.</paragraph>
