    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the first national protest demonstration against the Vietnam War occurred 40 years ago this month. About 100,000 Americans came to Washington in October 1967 to protest that foreign policy disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vietnam was a war of choice. We invaded a country that never attacked us. We sent our troops into the middle of a civil war that had nothing to do with us. We went to war in a country whose culture or history we did not understand. We had no exit strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We went to war after Congress authorized the President to do so. We  found out later that the congressional resolution was based on false information supplied by the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Vietnam War divided our people. It led to the deaths of thousands of American troops and countless innocent civilians. It undermined our moral leadership in the world. We went to war alone. We were isolated from our allies. It was a propaganda victory for our enemies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is more, Mr. Speaker. We propped up an often corrupt government that couldn't figure out how to rule. We kept waiting for South Vietnamese troops to stand up so we could stand down. The Vietnam War squandered our Nation's treasure. It diverted us from solving our own domestic problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We said the war was all about spreading freedom. But the people of the country we invaded saw it as a foreign occupation. The occupation went on year after year. It passed from one administration to another. Our leaders kept telling us victory was just around the corner if we put more troops in. It devastated the country we were trying to save. It was a political, economic and moral catastrophe for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was Vietnam. But it sounds exactly like Iraq. Today we are repeating the same terrible mistakes in Iraq that we made 40 years ago in Vietnam. Some of the Members of this House who support our occupation of Iraq lived through Vietnam. They have had 40 years to think about it. Yet they still miss the point. The doctrine of preemptive war is not suited to America because we are not warmongers. The American people do not believe in shooting first and asking questions later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one other mistake we made back then that I hope we won't repeat, but I am afraid we will. The war in Vietnam spread to another country when we bombed Cambodia. Today, there is growing evidence that the administration is getting ready to spread the war in Iraq to another country. That would be Iran. About a week ago, the administration warned that Iran would face serious consequences if it proceeded on its current course. We all wonder what that means. Does it mean another round of shock  and awe? Another country for our reckless leaders to bomb?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the administration needs to consider the "serious consequences" that America will face if we attack yet another Middle Eastern country. Our occupation of Iraq has produced a fresh new crop of terrorists. Using military force instead of diplomacy to get Iran to act responsibly will certainly do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, Mr. Speaker, when America was involved in Kosovo, the then-Governor of Texas said, and I quote him, "Victory means exit strategy, and it's important for the President to explain to us what that exit strategy is." That Governor of Texas is now in the White House. But he is not following his own advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has no exit strategy for Iraq. So it is up to Congress to provide one. We must use our power, the power of the purse, to defund the war. Then we must fully fund the safe, orderly and responsible redeployment of our troops' withdrawal and the withdrawal of all military contractors. Then we must launch a vigorous regional and international diplomatic effort to bring peace to Iraq and help it rebuild.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years ago, the administration called for an initiative to improve Americans' understanding of history. Our leaders in the White House should start by learning the history of Vietnam.</paragraph>
