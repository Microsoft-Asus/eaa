  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10209">S10209</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. The time will be equally controlled between the two leaders. At 3 p.m., the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="796">H.R. 796</bill>, with the time until 5:30 to be equally divided and controlled between Senators Baucus and Grassley or their designees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 5:30, the Senate will proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. If cloture is invoked, we can proceed to this very important legislation quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all Members of the Senate, last week we accomplished a lot. Here are the "must dos" this week: SCHIP and lobbying and ethics reform. There are other things we would like to do and, if we can get consent, we will do them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The competitiveness conference report is completed. I hope we can do that by unanimous consent. The WRDA bill is completed, and we hope to be able to do that by unanimous consent. We also, again, later today, will offer a unanimous consent request to do the Freedom of Information Act improvements. This is an extremely important piece of legislation. It has bipartisan support and Senators Leahy and Cornyn are the sponsors. I hope we can complete this before we leave. The Republicans  raised an objection last week when we raised this by unanimous consent. I hope that problem is now taken care of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is what we have to do. I will repeat, we must complete SCHIP and lobbying and ethics reform, and the other matters would be icing on the cake if we can do them.</paragraph>
