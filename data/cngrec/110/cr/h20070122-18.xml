    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to honor those who make a difference in the lives of our young people across the United States. This January marks the National Mentoring Month 2007, a month-long event honoring those who are mentors. This event also draws attention to the great need for additional volunteer mentors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know, Mr. Speaker, many of our children can become lost at an early age without a responsible adult to show them the way. Our children need to know that somebody older cares, and that is what mentoring is all about, showing our kids that we care. Unfortunately, many of our children do not have such an adult in their lives, and without a solid role model, the consequences for our children can be detrimental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a third of those entering high school do not graduate and will face limited job prospects, according to the Government Accountability Office. This alarming statistic I think would be lower if each one of these kids had a solid mentor to stress the importance of education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no substitute for a healthy relationship with an adult. A caring adult is one of the most important aspects of adolescent development. When a responsible and reliable adult becomes a mentor, the benefits to the mentee last a lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another aspect of mentoring sometimes that we overlook are the vast  benefits to the mentors themselves. Helping a younger person find their way can be extremely fulfilling, and often those who become a mentor continue to volunteer throughout their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chris Warren became a mentor to Joshua Becerra in my hometown of San Diego through the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program in 1999. As a mentor, Chris taught Joshua the value of education and encouraged him to study hard in school. Joshua is now a student at High Tech High School and has already visited UCLA, San Diego State University and other campuses trying to decide where to attend college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a role model, the relationship has given Chris a healthier perspective on what is important in life, that is, helping others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The relationship between Joshua and Chris shows what a mentor can do for a young person, and it also shows the joy it can bring to the mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of adults nationwide have similar relationships with children who face problems at home or struggle at school. Unfortunately, research shows that about 15 million children across the United States are in need of a good role model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution calls on more adults to make a difference in the lives of our young people, and we in Congress also need to heed this call. Federal programs that encourage mentoring need our support. The Mentoring Children of Prisoners program began in 2001 to provide guidance and friendship to children with at least one incarcerated parent. Funding for the program was targeted for a 20 percent reduction for the current fiscal year. Funding for a number of mentoring programs through the Department  of Education was targeted for considerable reductions as well. I urge my colleagues to increase our support for these programs and to put a priority on mentoring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also encourage programs that recruit young people to become mentors to those who are younger. It is these programs that will help create a cycle of mentoring between the generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line: our children need strong, responsible mentors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the millions of adults, and there are millions of them out there, who are mentoring our children, and call on more adults to become role models to those who are in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to bring this resolution to the House floor to call attention to this worthy cause on the occasion of National Mentoring Month 2007. I urge its passage today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 29, which celebrates mentors who are positively impacting the lives of young people and highlights the need for additional mentors to make themselves available to America's youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Representative SUSAN DAVIS' continued efforts to draw attention and support to this very important issue, and I appreciate her dedicated leadership in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentors give their time and energy to improve the lives of American young people who increasingly spend less time with concerned adult role models. According to the National Mentoring Institute, young people with mentors are roughly half as likely as those without mentors to begin using illegal drugs, 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol, and 50 percent less prone to absenteeism from school. The positive effects of mentoring also include the improvement of academic achievement, a reduction  in violent behavior, and a higher self-esteem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December 2006, President Bush proclaimed January 2007 as National Mentoring Month, giving public recognition to mentors who serve as role models and provide quality involvement and interaction in the lives of America's youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As the President said, "Through friendship and encouragement, mentors can help prepare young Americans for a hopeful future."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By honoring mentors and mentoring programs, we recognize the importance of mentoring programs implemented in our local schools and communities. We also draw attention to the components of a quality program, including appropriate screening of potential mentors and careful matching of youth with adults who have a genuine interest in providing guidance and being exemplary role models.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentoring programs are varied and unique. They can be school-based or faith-based, and they may be established through community organizations or corporate initiatives. I encourage people across the country to take the time to discover what mentoring programs exist in their communities and see what they can do to help. Many volunteers are needed to meet the growing demand for mentors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I am pleased to recognize the important work of mentors and the quality mentoring programs, and I urge Members to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I really am pleased to be here on behalf of this resolution today. I urge and thank those who have continued to volunteer as mentors in our communities to continue on with those efforts, and I urge that those adults who have not embarked on mentoring think about it and join with some organizations that could help them move forward and help many of our young people who are in the community today and who need their help, their support and certainly the caring  that they bring.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="29">H. Res. 29</bill>, to support the goals and ideals of National Mentoring Month. As Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. DAVIS, for introducing this bill to highlight the importance of mentoring our youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today many youth face temptations that often lead them down destructive paths and it is vitally important that we provide guidance that helps them make good decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentors have been an integral part of society for many years, dating back to Ancient Greece. The Greek poet Homer wrote in the Odyssey, that when Odysseus left to fight in the Trojan War, he charged Mentor, his wise old friend, with the task of caring for his son, Telemachus, and teaching him wisdom. Since then, the word mentor has come to mean a wise and responsible tutor or an experienced person who advises, guides, teaches, challenges, corrects, and serves as a model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our society today, mentors exist in many different environments. There are mentors in professional settings who guide apprentices by teaching them how to effectively perform in the workplace. There are mentors in academic settings who guide students, teaching them how to reach and maintain high scholastic achievement. There are mentors in community groups who guide their prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233;s through life issues, teaching them how to be productive citizens. There are mentors in spiritual and  church groups who advise others through their spiritual growth. In all cases, they are very important and essential to the success of the youth that they mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who needs mentors?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 35.2 million young people ages 10-18 in the U.S. today; of those young people: 1 out of 4 lives with only one parent; 1 out of 10 was born to teen parents; 1 out of 5 lives in poverty; 1 out of 10 will not finish high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About half of young Americans--17.6 million young people--want or need caring adult mentors to help them succeed in life. Of those 17.6 million young people, only 2.5 million are currently in formal mentoring relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That leaves 15.1 million youth still in need of formal mentoring relationships. We call this our nation's "mentoring gap."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, imagine if every child had a mentor--just one person whom they could look up to and go to for advice and guidance. Imagine how many young lives could be positively impacted. We could create the avenues and encouragement to ensure that all of our children receive the proper education. Too many of our youth are not being properly advised and guided on the importance of getting an education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentors can help give those youth living in poverty to strive towards a brighter future for themselves. Every child could benefit from having someone in his or her life to turn to for advice and help in the time of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National research has shown that children who have mentors are more confident in their  academic performance, able to get along better with their families, 46 percent less likely to begin using illegal drugs, 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol and 52 percent less likely to skip school. The positive relationships and reinforcement that mentors provide is clearly effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the efforts of the mentors in our nation who encourage and motivate our youth to realize their worth and become productive citizens. I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking and supporting them by passing this resolution, <bill type="hr" number="29">H. Res. 29</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="29">H. Res. 29</bill>, which has been introduced in recognition of the goals and ideals of National Mentoring Month for 2007. Young people today are confronted with many challenges in life. They can find the confidence to overcome many of these challenges through a mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits of a mentor are immeasurable. We take this opportunity today through consideration of this resolution to honor those mentors who unselfishly give of their time to encourage and support students across our country. Mentors provide important guidance and friendship to students and they serve as positive role models in our community. Mentors listen and above all, they care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentors leave an indelible imprint on our minds and hearts. I, as well as many of my colleagues, had mentors that helped us shape our aspirations and achieve our goals. The confidence and support that they provide is something that every young person deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there are not enough mentors for the millions of children who want or need them. Currently, as this resolution notes, approximately 15 million young people are in need of mentors across our country. As we celebrate National Mentoring Month, let us commit ourselves to raising awareness and to promoting the rewards of mentoring for mentors, our children, our communities and our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also take this opportunity today to commend the young people who participate in mentoring programs. Their involvement in mentoring partnerships demonstrates their personal commitment to improve the lives of others. Let us continue to encourage them by providing additional opportunities and resources to enhance and reinforce their mentoring work. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.</paragraph>
