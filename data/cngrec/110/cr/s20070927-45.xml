  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="Introducing S. 2106. A bill to provide nationwide subpoena authority for actions brought under the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund of 2001; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2106">S. 2106</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to the offer the Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act, a simple bill that ensures procedural fairness for the parties to litigation arising out of the terrible events of September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we passed the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001, we established a Federal cause of action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York as the exclusive remedy for damages arising out of the September 11 attacks. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effectively limit service of a subpoena by a party to an action under the Victims Compensation Fund to within 100 miles of the Southern District of New York. Litigating a Federal cause of action under the Victims  Compensation Fund is likely to involve the testimony and the production of documents by a substantial number of witnesses who may not reside within 100 miles of the  Southern District of New York. Neither the Victims Compensation fund statute nor the Federal rules, however, currently provide an effective means for securing such testimony or documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act addresses this oversight by allowing parties to Victims Compensation Fund actions to subpoena witnesses and documents from anywhere in the U.S. The court retains its authority to quash or modify any such subpoena if it is unduly burdensome to the witness subpoenaed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice requires that the parties to cases arising under the Victims Compensation Fund have access to all the testimony and documents relevant to their claims, regardless of where in the U.S. the witnesses or documents are located. By granting the parties to such cases nationwide subpoena authority, administered by the Federal court, this act ensures that they do. As the bipartisan cosponsorship of the act attests, ensuring procedural fairness in these cases bearing on the terrible attacks of  September 11 is not a Democratic issue or Republican issue, it is an American issue. I strongly encourages my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me and the other cosponsors of this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 2109. A bill to designate certain Federal lands in Riverside County, California, as wilderness, to designate certain river segments in Riverside County as a wild, scenic, or recreational river, to adjust the boundary of the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2109">S. 2109</bill>] Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the California Desert and Mountain Heritage Act. This bipartisan legislation will protect nearly 200,000 acres of pristine and ecologically sensitive lands in Riverside County as Wilderness or Potential Wilderness, the highest level of protection and conservation for Federal public lands in American law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past year, I worked with my colleague, Representative MARY BONO, who represents the areas protected in this bill. Together, we worked to reach consensus with local officials, environmentalists, businesses, sportsmen, and Indian tribes. The result is this bipartisan, bicameral bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Riverside County contains some of California's, indeed, America's, most spectacular desert and mountain vistas and landscapes. The breathtaking lands protected in this bill also provide habitat for threatened bighorn sheep and the desert tortoise, as well as many other species such as mule deer, mountain quail, and bald eagles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill protects 150,531 acres of lands as wilderness, highest level of protection and conservation for Federal public lands in American law. Another 41,100 acres of land would be designated as potential wilderness. Once the final inholding claims are settled by the National Park Service, these lands will become "wilderness" without the necessity of an additional act of Congress. In the meantime, these lands will be managed by the Park Service as "wilderness."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also designates 31 miles of river as wild and scenic on four California Rivers: North Fork San Jacinto River, Fuller Mill Creek, Palm Canyon Creek, and Bautista Creek. These rivers are biologically important watersheds in this dry part of my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these lands were included in my statewide wilderness bill, the California Wild Heritage Act, which I reintroduced in February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has broad, local support including from Riverside County supervisors, municipalities, chambers of commerce, environmentalists, sportsmen, and businesses. The bill includes important provisions clarifying that Federal agencies could use all the tools necessary to fight and prevent wildfires. The wilderness boundaries were drawn in consultation with local communities and tribes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with local interests and all of my colleagues to see this important legislation enacted.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 2110. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 427 North Street in Taft, California, as the &quot;Larry S. Pierce Post Office&quot;; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2110">S. 2110</bill>] Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation honoring a fallen hero, Army Staff Sergeant Larry S. Pierce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would rename a post office in Taft, California after Staff Sergeant Pierce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Pierce moved to Taft, California as a young child and attended Taft city schools and Taft Union High School, which my own father graduated from in 1922.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Pierce would have graduated with the Taft Union High School class of 1959, but he chose to join the U.S. Army in 1958.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 20, 1965, Staff Sergeant Pierce was killed near Ben Cat in the Republic of Vietnam. He made the ultimate sacrifice to protect his comrades, smothering the blast of an anti-personnel mine with his body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was only 24 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He left behind his wife, Verlin, and three children: Teresa, Kelley, and Gregory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Lyndon B. Johnson posthumously awarded Staff Sergeant Pierce the Medal of Honor on February 24, 1966. The citation on his Medal of Honor reads as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Pierce was serving as squad leader in a  reconnaissance platoon when his patrol was ambushed by hostile forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his inspiring leadership and personal courage, the squad succeeded in eliminating an enemy machinegun and routing the opposing force. While pursuing the fleeing enemy, the squad came upon a dirt road and, as the main body of his men entered the road, Sgt. Pierce discovered an antipersonnel mine emplaced in the road bed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Realizing that the mine could destroy the majority of his squad, Sgt. Pierce saved the lives of his men at the sacrifice of his life by throwing himself directly onto the mine as it exploded. Through his indomitable courage, complete disregard for his safety, and profound concern for his fellow soldiers, he averted loss of life and injury to the members of his squad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sgt. Pierce's extraordinary heroism, at the cost of his life, are in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Naming the Taft Post Office in Staff Sergeant Pierce's honor is a fitting commemoration and meaningful way for the community to remember the  dedication and sacrifices of the members of our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the members of the Taft City Council, who passed a resolution on September 4, 2007 to request that Congress rename the Taft Post Office the Larry S. Pierce Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely hope that my colleagues will support this resolution to honor the service and sacrifice of Staff Sergeant Pierce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="Introducing S. 2111. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to allow State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and schools to increase implementation of early intervention services, particularly school-wide positive behavior supports; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2111">S. 2111</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to provide teachers an extra tool for the important work they do. This legislation will expand an approach that is successfully improving student behavior and the climate for learning in thousands of schools across the country: Positive Behavior Supports. I am pleased to be joined by Senators DURBIN and SANDERS in introducing the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act, and I urge other colleagues to join us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good school climate supports good teaching. Positive Behavior Supports are already being used in my home State of Illinois, where there is a network to provide assistance for schools that adopt this approach. In these schools, students are taught about positive behavior, teachers and administrators are supported in learning motivational techniques, and adults set the same high standards for student conduct as they do for student achievement. Students are helped to see the importance of behaving  in a way so that they and their classmates can learn. The components necessary to do this on a school-wide basis include an agreement by the entire staff to define and support appropriate student behavior. Although this seems simple, it is often more effective than surveillance cameras, zero tolerance or other get-tough approaches to school discipline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Positive Behavior Supports programs deal with discipline problems based on one simple premise: stop problem behavior before it starts. The specifics of the program are research-based, backed by both experiment and experience. With Positive Behavior Supports, learning time increases, and students do better. It makes sense that with fewer disruptions, with less time in the principal's office, or out of school, students can focus more, and so learn more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Positive Behavior Supports are already established in many places. Universities and resource centers work with over 6,700 schools in 38 States. To help teachers teach our children, today I propose that we expand this innovative program. The Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act amends ESEA to allow Title I funds to be used for Positive Behavior Supports, and creates an office in the Department of Education to assist in these efforts. The act provides flexibility for schools and districts  to use Title I funds, so that schools and teachers can choose to receive assistance to improve school climate and thereby support teaching and opportunities for students to learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My good friend from Illinois, Congressman PHIL HARE, has introduced companion legislation in the House, and I urge my colleagues to join our effort in the Senate. Let us give our teachers an additional tool to support their teaching. Let us give our children the benefit of high expectations and supports for good behavior. Let us give our schools the opportunity to adopt this approach. Let us help our kids by supporting Positive Behavior Supports.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="Introducing S. 2115. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to extend for 6 months the eligibility period for the &quot;Welcome to Medicare&quot; physical examination and to provide for the coverage and waiver of cost-sharing for preventive services under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2115">S. 2115</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Preventive Services Coverage Act of 2007. It has been ten years since Congress enacted the first comprehensive package of preventive services for Medicare beneficiaries. At the time Medicare was created in 1965, it was modeled closely after the indemnity health insurance policies of the time. As such, Medicare only covered the treatment of illnesses, and it paid for tests only when a symptom was present, but it did not cover preventive  services. Over the next 3 decades, the medical community learned a great deal about the importance of preventive care. Although as early as the 1970s, health maintenance organizations had begun to cover cancer screenings and other wellness services, traditional Medicare had not kept pace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 changed that. Working across the aisle, I introduced legislation that year to provide coverage for lifesaving screenings to Medicare beneficiaries. With strong bipartisan support, Congress added our language to BBA 1997, ensuring coverage for preventive services, including: an annual screening mammography for women over age 39; screening pap smear and pelvic examination for cervical cancer; prostate cancer screening; colorectal cancer screening; bone mass measurement  for osteoporosis; and diabetes testing supplies and self-management training services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress expanded this list of benefits in subsequent Medicare legislation. Now traditional Medicare also covers cardiovascular screenings to help prevent heart attacks and strokes; diabetes screenings; flu shots to help prevent influenza, glaucoma screening, medical nutrition therapy services, Hepatitis B vaccine, and ultrasound screening for aortic aneurysm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medicare also now covers a one-time "Welcome to Medicare Visit" within the first 6 months of Part B enrollment. This is an initial physical examination where beneficiaries can receive education and counseling about their medical history and needs, have some preventive screenings performed, and get referrals for other services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, over the past decade, Medicare has indeed made great strides toward helping our seniors get screened for diseases. But we have far to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The participation rate for Medicare preventive benefits is low. One key obstacle is financial. America's seniors still have the highest out-of-pocket costs of any age group. A 2007 Kaiser Family Foundation study compared out-of-pocket health care spending among age groups. For nonprescription drug expenses, it found that average spending for the over-65 population was nearly twice that for under-65 group. It also showed that on average, seniors in one-person households are spending 12.5 percent  of their incomes on health care, versus 2.2 percent of those under 65. This means that excluding prescription drug costs, despite Medicare Part D, seniors will have very high</paragraph>
    <paragraph>medical bills that stretch their fixed incomes. It is no wonder that preventive services that require cost-sharing will be delayed or not received at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, we have also improved the benefits. We have waived the deductible for mammograms and colorectal cancer screenings. But cost sharing is still an obstacle for many seniors. They still must satisfy the deductible before getting reimbursed for the physical exam and most other services, and they must pay coinsurance for all other services except laboratory tests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that I am introducing today will waive the cost sharing for all preventive screenings and the Welcome to Medicare physical examination. It will also grant the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to add additional benefits as he or she determines to be "reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness or disability." These determinations would take into account evidence-based recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and  other organizations. Finally, my bill would extend eligibility for the Welcome to Medicare Visit from its current time frame of 6 months to 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will mean the difference between early screening and delayed diagnosis and treatment. It will mean the difference between detecting a serious illness and providing hundreds of thousands of dollars of services later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me explain why. Preventive services such as mammography and colonoscopy are important tools in the fight against serious disease. The earlier they are detected, the greater the chances of survival. For example, when caught in the first stages, the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is 98 percent. But if the cancer has spread, that rate declines to 26 percent. Similarly, if colorectal cancer is detected in its early states, the survival rate is 90 percent, but only 10 percent if found  when it is most advanced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our seniors are at particular risk for cancer. The greatest single risk factor for colorectal cancer is being over the age of 50, when more than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed. In addition to increasing survival rates, identifying diseases early reduces Medicare costs. In the case of colorectal cancer, Medicare will pay $207 for a screening colonoscopy in a medical facility, but if the patient is not diagnosed until the disease has metastasized, the cost of care can exceed $60,000 over the  patient's lifetime. Medicare pays $98 for a mammogram, but if breast cancer is not detected early, treatment can cost tens of thousands of dollars more, depending on when the cancer is found and the course of treatment used. One drug used to treat late stage breast cancer can cost as much as $40,000 a year. There can be no doubt that these services are both life saving and cost saving. But if seniors cannot afford the copayments for these services, they may delay getting them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to cancer, diabetes is another prevalent disease among seniors. The statistics associated with diabetes are staggering. Nearly 20 million Americans are estimated to have diabetes. Approximately half know they have diabetes and another half have diabetes but do not know it. But once diagnosed, the co-morbidities associated with diabetes can be avoided. It is estimated that 90 percent of diabetes-related blindness is preventable, 50 percent of kidney disease requiring dialysis is preventable,  50 percent of diabetic-related amputations are preventable and 50 percent of diabetic-related hospitalizations are preventable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diabetes and its complications are not only disabling, but costly to Medicare as well. The cost of medical care of people with diabetes is about $150 billion a year, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. In its direct costs, diabetes was the most costly of the 39 diseases reported. Despite the fact that 9 percent of the Medicare population is diagnosed with diabetes, about 27 percent of the Medicare budget is used to treat their diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of the cost for medical care of people with diabetes is for the treatment of the complications, which are largely preventable with modern treatment including blood sugar control. Clearly, prevention of the complications of diabetes would reduce the costs of diabetes in lives and in dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous studies have found that once diabetes management training is provided, populations see a nearly 50 percent reduction in emergency room visits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the number of outpatient visits, doctor office visits, and other medical expenses all decline. Diabetes can lead to amputations, blindness, heart disease, and stroke, all of which can be prevented with training and management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to add new preventive services based on the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. As we have seen, it can take a very long time for Congress to change health policy in this country. In order to add new preventive services to Medicare, it now requires legislative action. Under current law, as our researchers discover new, more efficient, and more accurate screening methods to detect disease, Congress  would have to pass new legislation authorizing coverage for each one. This provision would enable Medicare to provide coverage for new types of screenings based on up-to-date scientific evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Preventive Services Task Force has a long and distinguished record. It dates back to 1984, when the U.S. Public Health Service convened a panel of primary and preventive health care specialists to develop guidelines for preventive services. From this panel, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's Guide to Clinical Preventive Services was born. While many other respected professional and research organizations have issued their own recommendations, the Task Force's publication is regarded  as the "gold standard" reference on preventive services. In December of 1995, a new Task Force released an updated and expanded second edition of the Guide which includes findings on 200 preventive interventions for more than 70 diseases and conditions. The Task Force employed a rigorous methodology to review the evidence for and against hundreds of preventive services, assessing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The newest benefit is the Welcome to Medicare Visit, an initial physical examination for new beneficiaries. We know that large numbers of people in the 55 to 64 age group lack health insurance, so it is particularly important for them to get a baseline examination and screenings for diseases that affect elderly people But as of July 2006, only 2 percent of all new beneficiaries, or about 8,000 people, have received this physical exam. Uptake has been slow for a number of reasons. You must get  the exam within 6 months of enrolling in Medicare Part B. But many seniors don't learn about the benefit until they have been enrolled for a while, and even then it can take several months to schedule a physical examination with a doctor. So the vast majority of our seniors are missing out on this important benefit. My bill extends eligibility from 6 months after enrolling in Part B to 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to address the matter of cost, and that is the appropriate thing to do under our budget scoring principles. The elimination of cost sharing for preventive services has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office at $1.1 billion over 5 years. Based on CBO estimates from the 2003 Medicare law, extending the eligibility period for the Welcome to Medicare Visit from six months to one year will cost approximately $1.2 billion over years. But I believe that the members of this body  also understand that, although dynamic scoring is not used by CBO, preventive health care will save money. If we detect diseases earlier, the overall cost to our society will be less. Our seniors will save out of pocket costs and all taxpayers will save money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is supported by the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the Colorectal Cancer Coalition, C3, and the Society of Vascular Surgeons. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to get improve seniors' access to lifesaving preventive services.</paragraph>
