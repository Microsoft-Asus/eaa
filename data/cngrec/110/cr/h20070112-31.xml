  <speaking speaker="412188" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for the very first time in this distinguished Chamber representing the Eighth District of Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have made some major accomplishments this week, but one area that particularly pertains to my district and to the State of Arizona has not been addressed, and that is the crisis in illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, Congress and Washington have failed to act. We must secure the border now. My district and the State of Arizona have paid a heavy price for this burden. We know it in our schools, our hospitals and our law enforcement agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must move this year with a sense of urgency to pass a comprehensive immigration reform package that is tough, effective, and practical. We need to increase border security using modern-era technology, radar, drones, electronic surveillance. There must be more Border Patrol agents and more support for those Border Patrol agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need tough employer sanctions for those employers who are knowingly hiring people illegally, and a guest worker program, so that people can come in and work legally, safely, and return back to their home countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working to pass such measures will be my priority in this 110th Congress, and I look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle on this important issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
