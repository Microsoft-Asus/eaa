    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the lobbying and ethics reform bill that the Senate has passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 1990s, I along with several colleagues, including Senator William Cohen, embarked on a journey to enact meaningful lobbying and ethics reform. While we had been assured by colleagues that this was a monumental and perhaps impossible undertaking, we nonetheless forged ahead. Decade after decade, Congress had tried to close loopholes that had existed for almost 50 years, which kept lobbying activities in the dark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1995, we finally succeeded in passing the Lobbying Disclosure Act. Our bill, for the first time, opened up the world of lobbying, and the billions spent in it, to the light of day. That act required paid professional lobbyists to register and disclose whom they represent, how much they are paid, and the issues on which they are lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As much as we knew that the Lobbying Disclosure Act was a real step forward, we knew that like all procedural reforms, it too would eventually need updating. Inevitably, lawyers and lobbyists would find loopholes and create new methods to dance around the law's intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen this dance prominently over the past few years. From super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff's attempts to peddle influence, to Congressman Duke Cunningham's abuse of the appropriations process, it is obvious that the time to close these loopholes has come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that the Senate just passed brings much needed reforms, many of which I sought in the original Lobbying Disclosure Act over a decade ago. It goes after not only the real problems that have arisen over the past few years, but as the perception of corruption that is sometimes the effect of too little disclosure and rules which are too weak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important reforms in <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> is a strict curb on gifts by lobbyists to Members of Congress. These are perks that have no place in Government. The new rules in this bill will eliminate these gifts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased at the final outcome of the strong earmark reform provisions in this bill. Too many earmarks are added in the dead of night or buried in conference reports so dense that the average American has no idea where their tax dollars are going. The language can also be ambiguous to the point where we don't even know who is the intended beneficiary. This bill will require full and open disclosure of earmarks, which I hope will help to ensure the quality of the projects which are funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strong travel restrictions are also an essential component of this bill. The new rules will ensure that Members traveling on corporate jets would have to reimburse at the charter rate, not as is now the case merely at the level of a first class commercial ticket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I applaud passage of these strong reforms, I believe we needed to go even further. One of the most important provisions in this bill is one that I worked on with Senator Lieberman, which would have finally closed the major loophole that exists under current law that allows lobbyists to conceal millions of dollars worth of expenditures spent in stimulating "grassroots" lobbying efforts, or what has been described as "astroturf" lobbying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten years ago, when we enacted the Lobbying Disclosure Act, it required paid lobbyists to disclose the amounts that they spend to try to influence Congress and the executive branch. However, under the LDA, lobbyists are not required to disclose how much they spend in efforts to persuade others to help them make their case. In the mid-1990s, the Wall Street Journal estimated that major lobbying firms spent almost half a billion dollars every year for this purpose. The amounts have undoubtedly  grown substantially since then. Yet these amounts still go undisclosed on the lobbying disclosure forms filed by those firms. The disclosure provision in <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill> was intended to close this loophole and require paid lobbyists to disclose all of their expenditures, instead of just some of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision would have had no impact at all on citizens who contact their Government, regardless whether they decide to make those contacts on their own initiative or at the suggestion of others. It would have had no impact on religious organizations, unions, universities or other employers who suggest that their own members or employees contact the Government. It was aimed at paid lobbyists who spend large sums of money to persuade others to contact the Government in support of a lobbying  campaign that they are conducting on behalf of a client. These paid lobbyists would have been required to disclose how much they are  spending on such efforts. This disclosure, like lobbying disclosure in general, would have helped inform the public of pressures being brought to bear on their representatives by paid interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though identical language was passed by Congress last year when we considered a lobbying reform bill, it was stripped from the final version of this legislation. I nonetheless look forward to examining this issue in the future and hope to work with Chairman Lieberman in the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee this year to look for solutions to this loophole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased, however, that a provision I authored last year to require reporting by foreign lobbyists was included in the final passed bill. Foreign lobbyists file their disclosures under the Foreign Agents Registry Act. The forms are difficult to find and almost as hard to understand. My provision will require a publicly accessible, electronic database containing FARA disclosures in the same format that will be in place for registrants under the Lobbying Disclosure Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of scandals over the past few years have shown us that ethics and lobbying reform are vital. While this bill was not perfect, I believe it will go a long way to clean up corruption in Washington. This bipartisan effort in the Senate proves that we are up to the task of addressing corruption and perceived corruption in Congress. I am hopeful that the House will soon consider its own lobbying reform legislation and that we will have strong provisions signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But signing this legislation into law cannot be the end of our efforts. The 12 years since the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act have shown the lengths to which some will go to find loopholes in the law to circumvent the reforms and undermine the safeguards that we have enacted. We must remain vigilant to protect the integrity of the legislative process in the coming years and be prepared, if necessary, to revisit the issue with future legislation.</paragraph>
