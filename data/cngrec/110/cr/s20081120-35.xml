  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="STAFF SERGEANT TIMOTHY H. WALKER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life and heroic service of SSG Timothy H. Walker. Staff Sergeant Walker, a member of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq on November 8, 2008, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was 38 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Tennessee, Staff Sergeant Walker joined the Army in 1990. He served in Bosnia from 1999 to 2000, Kuwait in 2001, and also served two tours of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During his most recent deployment, Staff Sergeant Walker, a combat medic himself, was actively involved in training Iraqis to treat combat wounds on the battlefield, and he served as the medical material coordinator for the Iraqi Security Forces logistics coordination team, which teaches Iraqi police  officers and soldiers how to track and receive medical supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his 18 years of service, and in every capacity, Staff Sergeant Walker distinguished himself through his courage, his dedication to duty, and his willingness to take on any challenge--no matter how dangerous, no matter how big or small. His extraordinary bravery and talent earned him more than 20 awards and medals, including the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Walker is remembered by those who knew him as a consummate professional and friend who they could turn to in times of need, and who they could always count on to raise their spirits in times of sadness. They recall his knack for giving people nicknames, and the infectiousness of his laughter. And, most of all, they remember his devotion to his wife and children, and to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Greek historian Thucydides wrote that "the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it." Throughout our Nation's history, the bravest have gone out to meet every danger that has imperiled our way of life. They stormed the beaches of Normandy and Iwo Jima facing long odds, and now, in 2008, they traverse the mountains of Afghanistan and navigate the cities of Iraq under constant threat of  insurgent attacks. The bravest have kept us safe and strong. They will always make us proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Walker's service was in keeping with this American tradition. At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones throughout the world to attend to the injuries of his men. And though their fate on the battlefield was uncertain, his men knew that, in Staff Sergeant Walker, they were in good hands. For the lives he saved, and for the lives he touched, Staff Sergeant Walker will be forever remembered as one of the bravest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Staff Sergeant Walker's mother Barbara, his father Wayne, his wife Dawn, his children Gregory and Madison, his sister Shelly, and all his friends and family, I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss is  assuaged by your pride in Tim's service to his country and by your knowledge that his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life and heroic service of Sergeant Jon L. Stiles. Sergeant Stiles, assigned to the 927th Engineer Company, 769th Engineer Battalion, was killed on November 13, 2008, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his patrol in Shubhuyan, Afghanistan. He was 38 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Stiles grew up in Highlands Ranch, CO, and after graduating from high school, spent nearly 13 years in the U.S. Marine Corps and 2 years in the Army. Two years following his discharge, he moved back to Colorado, joined the Colorado National Guard, and was deployed to Afghanistan, where he worked to clear transportation routes of IEDs and insurgents in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past October, Sergeant Stiles saved the lives of three fellow soldiers when he rescued them from underneath a burning vehicle that was struck by a suicide bomber, an act of incredible bravery that earned him the Bronze Star. He suffered serious damage to his lungs and vocal chords as a result of this incident, but instead of taking medical leave, he insisted on returning to battle. He believed strongly in our mission in Afghanistan, cared deeply for his men, and wanted to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Stiles' friends and family remember him as a soldier's soldier with a passion for military service in his DNA. He was an avid outdoorsman known to brave sub-zero temperatures to get in a day of fishing. He was generous with hugs and incredibly loyal to his friends. He was a loving husband who wanted to live peacefully with his wife in the mountains of Colorado. And he was a proud American willing to sacrifice everything in defense of the country he held dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adlai Stevenson once asked, "what do we mean by patriotism in the context of our times? I venture to suggest that what we mean is a sense of national responsibility ..... a patriotism which is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime." Sergeant Stiles felt this sense of responsibility at a young age and served with the steady dedication that reminds us of what it is to be a true patriot. In his memory, and with his inspiration, may we all  continue to work to make our union more perfect, and our world safer for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Sergeant Stiles' mother Linda, his father Lynn, his wife Launa, his sister Natalie, his brother Charles, his grandparents Maxine and Kenney, and all his friends and family, I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss is assuaged by your pride in Jon's service to his country and by your knowledge that his country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, Arkansas is grieving for a young hero, a courageous soldier who was serving in Iraq as a member of the 224th Maintenance Company. This team keeps our troops safe and their equipment and vehicles running. It is a mission paramount to our soldiers' success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A member of the National Guard for almost 7 years, SPC James Clay of Mountain Home, AR, showed great commitment and patriotism throughout his assignment with the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment, 39th Brigade Combat team. Of his service, MG William Wofford, adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard recalls, "He was called to serve, and he answered that call with valiant service. He was a true patriot and will not soon be forgotten."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Clay's untimely death has brought me to the Senate floor today, but I want to take a minute to honor his life. He overcame major obstacles in his personal life, including the death of both his parents, yet he graduated from Cotter High School in 2002 where teachers describe him as outstanding, considerate, and spirited. Friends remember Specialist Clay as a role model who persevered with dignity and humanity. Everyone who knew this young hero recalled his great smile and his compassion  for others. It is no surprise that he died fighting for the peace and security of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My prayers go out to Specialist Clay's family and friends, particularly his high school sweetheart and wife, Mellissa Clay. During his second Inaugural Address, Abraham Lincoln pledged, "to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphans." Mrs. Clay, we will never forget the sacrifice of your loved one, and we work to honor his memory, courage, and service to our great Nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="CORPORAL ADRIAN ROBLES">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marine Cpl Adrian Robles, who was killed in action in Afghanistan on October 22, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Robles, who was a native of Scottsbluff, NE, was assigned to the Second Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force, based at Twentynine Palms, CA. He had worked his whole life to become a marine. At age 16, Corporal Robles told his parents about his plans to enlist and, at 17, asked that they sign forms which would allow him to join before his 18th birthday. His parents told him to wait, so he finished high school and then enlisted immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Robles had previously served in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006, and was on a tour serving in Afghanistan at the time of his death. Corporal Robles received three good conduct medals--an unusual achievement for such a young marine--as well as medals for his service in Iraq and Afghanistan. He served as a rifleman, the backbone of the Marine Corps. Originally deployed to help train Afghan Army recruits, his unit's mission changed as the security situation deteriorated; and Corporal. Robles  was "in the fight" right to the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fully aware of the dangers he faced, Corporal Robles made the courageous choice to serve his country and help the people of Iraq and Afghanistan achieve peace and security. He made the ultimate sacrifice so that others might enjoy the freedoms he had known all his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Robles represents all that we have to be proud of in our Armed Forces. I commend his bravery and selflessness while offering my deepest condolences to the family members he left behind. It is small comfort for those who must now go on without one they loved so dearly, but they know that Corporal Robles gave his life for a noble goal. I join all Nebraskans--indeed, all Americans--in mourning the loss of such a fine young man.</paragraph>
