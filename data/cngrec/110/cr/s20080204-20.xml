    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letter and attachment be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, </narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, February 4, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. LEADER: <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>, the National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of 2007, is a collection of 56 separate legislative measures under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Forty-five consist of the text of separate bills passed by the House of Representatives, nine are drawn from separate subtitles of another House-passed bill, and one is a House-passed concurrent resolution. Only one provision, section 482, contains  new matter that has not passed the House of Representatives. A complete list of the House bills (and their Senate companion measures, where they exist) was printed in the Congressional Record on December 13, 2007, at pages <bill type="s" number="15474">S15474</bill>-S15475.</narrative>
  <narrative>I assembled the 56 measures into a single bill in order to facilitate their consideration by the Senate. Although <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> was placed on the Calendar without referral to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, most of the House bills that make up <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> have been reported, or ordered reported, by the Committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides that, before proceeding to the consideration of a bill, the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction must certify that each congressionally designated spending item in the bill and the name of the Senator requesting it has been identified and posted on a publicly accessible website. The term "congressionally designated spending item" is broadly defined, in pertinent part, to include "a provision ..... included primarily at the request  of a Senator ..... authorizing ..... a specific amount of discretionary budget authority ..... for ..... expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process."</narrative>
  <narrative>Ten of the House-passed bills incorporated into <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> contain provisions authorizing the appropriation of specific amounts targeted to specific entities or localities. These authorizations are included in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> because they are part of the House-passed text. No Senator submitted a request to me to include them.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the interest of furthering the transparency and accountability of the legislative process, however, I have posted a list of the specific authorizations in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' website. The list includes the name of the principal sponsor of the Senate companion measure that corresponds to the House-passed bill. A copy of the list is attached for your convenience.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, I have asked the principal sponsor of the Senate companion measure of each House bill contained in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> to certify that neither the Senator nor the Senator's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and have posted the certifications on the Committee's website. All certifications received by the Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of Rule XLIV are posted on the Committee's website as soon as practicable after they are received in accordance with paragraph 6(b).</narrative>
  <narrative>Thus, in accordance with Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby certify that each congressionally directed spending item in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> has been identified through a list and that the list was posted on the Committee's publicly accessible website at approximately 2:30 p.m. on February 4, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Jeff Bingaman,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
