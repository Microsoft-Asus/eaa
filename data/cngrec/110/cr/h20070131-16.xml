  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to wish a happy birthday today to my constituent, Marion Stout. She is 111 today and is now the oldest person in Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She never misses a church service at Second Presbyterian Church in Knoxville. She walks two or three times a week with her caregiver, who says she walks until she gets tired, but she never gets tired. For her walks, she always wears a pretty dress, heels and rouge to highlight her blue eyes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter what small thing someone does for her, she always says thank you. She says, I eat right, take care of myself and stay positive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She bought some GE stock when she was 102 because she wanted a good, long-term investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the entire House wants to join me in wishing Marion Stout a happy 111th birthday today.</paragraph>
