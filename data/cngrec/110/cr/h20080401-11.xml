    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support legislation honoring a great American on his 81st birthday, Cesar Chavez. Cesar Estrada Chavez is best known as a farm worker, labor leader and civil rights activist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Yuma, Arizona, of Mexican descent, Chavez became a champion for his fellow farm workers. Among his many achievements, Cesar Chavez was cofounder of the United Farm Workers Association with fellow activist Dolores Huerta. This association provided farm workers with a voice that they so desperately needed. Mr. Speaker, as a lifetime farmer, I can appreciate the sacrifices made by Chavez and his supporters. My oldest brother, Leandro Salazar, the oldest of our family, marched with Cesar  Chavez in California for nearly 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe that forcing workers to endure this labor under dangerous working conditions and without fair pay is absurd. The most horrific sight that you can ever see is farm workers working out in the field and an aerial applicator coming down upon them and spraying pesticides on them. He worked to make sure that those things did not happen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot stand by when a laborer is forced to work even as pesticides are being sprayed on the field he or she is working in. His dedication to the cause of worker rights and equality addressed the needs of blue collar men and women across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, his example inspires us to work together to improve the quality of life for all Americans.</paragraph>
