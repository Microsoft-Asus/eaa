  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President persists, despite the contrary advice of his most experienced and senior military officers in the field, that escalation is the answer to the chaos, the sectarian strife, in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is not only perpetuating his failed status quo stay-the-course strategy; he actually is going to undermine the U.S. forces and our allies in the most critical conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember his phrase, "Fight them there or fight them here"? Well, that is true, but not in Iraq. That is true in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember "Osama bin Ladin: dead or alive"? The Taliban, al Qaeda? Well, they are resurgent and they are going to threaten Kandahar we are told by our commanders in the field in the spring, and they have asked for reinforcements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what is the President doing to perpetuate his failed policy in Iraq, an unnecessary war in an area that doesn't threaten the United States of America? He is withdrawing U.S. troops from southern Afghanistan and sending them on a failed mission in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He could be the only President to lose two wars at the same time.</paragraph>
