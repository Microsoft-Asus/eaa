Res. 32</bill>, denouncing the practices of female genital mutilation, domestic violence, "honor" killings, acid burning, dowry deaths, and other gender-based persecutions and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that participation, protection, recognition, and independence of women is crucial to achieving a just, moral, and honorable society, as well as 950, <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the War Profiteering Prevention Act  of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please accept my apologies as I was attending a family event in Arizona and was not able to cast my votes tonight. It was my intention to vote "yea" on both <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill> and <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>.</paragraph>
