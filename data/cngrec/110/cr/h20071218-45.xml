    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to support <bill type="h" number="3690">H.R. 3690</bill>, after its amendment by the Senate. This bill would provide for the merger between the Library of Congress Police and the United States Capitol Police. The Senate has returned this bill with minor technical changes and clarifying language regarding the computation of annuities for retiring police officers with prior service. These changes are both accurate and appropriate, and I thank my colleagues in the other body for their work on this  bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I've said before, I'm confident that while the Library of Congress Police and the U.S. Capitol Police Force have different protocols and objectives, this merger will leverage the institutional knowledge of the Library staff with the expertise of the Capitol Police for the benefit of both organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to partnering with Chairman BRADY, who's done yeoman work on this issue, to ensure that the committee maintains ongoing communications with the Library and Capitol Police so that going forward both organizations have the resources and assistance they need to successfully integrate their law enforcement divisions. In particular, we wish to provide the Library and the Capitol Police with a means to communicate with the Congress on the progress of the merger and consider any  guidance or resources that they require to achieve long-term success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, as amended; and it will ensure that the Library's treasures are protected from harm and preserved for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
