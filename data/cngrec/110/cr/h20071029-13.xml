  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the designation of October 2007 as "Country Music Month" and to celebrate the long heritage of patriotism in country music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Country Music Association celebrated its first National Country Music Month in 1964, and October 2007 marks its 43rd annual observance. I would like to thank my fellow Texan, Congressman TED POE, for bringing this bill forward today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The themes invoked in country music resonate with important American values such as responsibility, determination and hard work. Country songs foster an appreciation of the many important sacrifices made by our men and women serving in the Armed Forces. Songs like "Only in America" by Brooks and Dunn and "Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly" by Aaron Tippen encourage patriotism and the pursuit of the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to powerful patriotic lyrics, the country music industry has also directly supported the cause of our Armed Forces. Portions of the proceeds from some patriotic compilations have gone to support the USO's active duty troops and families of fallen soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I express my support for Country Music Month and congratulate the genre on its many contributions to American society. I urge my colleagues to pass the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hj" number="58">H.J. Res. 58</bill>, expressing support for the designation of the month of October as "Country Music Month" and to honor country music for its long history of supporting America's Armed Forces and its tremendous impact on national patriotism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Country music is a blend of popular musical forms originally found in the southern region of the United States. I am proud to represent the birthplace of country music, Bristol, Tennessee. Country music has roots in traditional folk music, Celtic music, blues, gospel music, and old-time music and evolved rapidly in the 1920s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its sound and style has changed dramatically over the years. In the early years, country music was more of the honky-tonk sound from the likes of Ernest Tubbs and Hank Williams. In the 1930s and 1940s, another form of country music emerged, western country. These songs romanticized the life of the lonely, but heroic cowboy on the western frontier. Some of those famous for this western style were Gene Autry, America's singing cowboy, and Roy Rogers, who later teamed with wife Dale Evans to become  the famous duo of the genre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Country music morphed once again in the early 1950s with a sound that became known as rockabilly, a combination of rock and roll and hillbilly music. This sound was made popular by many performers who developed staying power in the country music industry. They include the Everly Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, and, of course, the king himself, Elvis Presley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the 1960s, country music found its home in Nashville, Tennessee. The Nashville sound was born. This was most definitely the sound of country, but the sixties saw more steel guitars and drums in the Nashville sound. This era of country music was the beginning of the age of contemporary country music which ushered in today's most popular artists, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, and Reba McEntire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, country music is at its highest peak of popularity. As of 2007, country is the most popular radio format in America, reaching 77.3 million adults, almost 40 percent of the adult population, every week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Country music is a story of family, faith, freedom, pride and patriotism. It embodies the American spirit and has played an integral part in encouraging Americans to support our Armed Forces. These songs invoke feelings of determination, liberty and responsibility, all of which this great country was founded upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, October was declared Country Music Month in honor of its rich history and tremendous impact on national patriotism. Country music is America's music, and for this reason I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hj" number="58">H.J. Res. 58</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me this time, and I am delighted the member from Tennessee, the country music capital, is a cosponsor of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the majority and Mr. Hinojosa for quickly getting this House resolution to the floor. I know there was some difficulty in doing it because of the timetable, but I appreciate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, country music is definitely a sound that is uniquely American because it speaks to the heart and soul of everyday Americans. It is about the ups and downs of everyday life, as well as the struggles individuals have in this country, and the struggles our Nation confronts as a country. They are exemplified gloriously through the gifted songwriting of our country music artists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At no time is this more true than when songs are written during trying times for our country and for the unwavering support of our men and women who wear the uniform who are willing to fight and even die, if necessary, for this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Toby Keith sang in "America Soldier" about our troops. He said, "Up and at 'em bright and early, I'm all business in my suit. I'm dressed for success from my head down to my boots. I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway, providing our future's my responsibility. I will always do my duty. No matter what the price. If  dying's asked of me, I'll bear that cross with an honor, 'cause freedom don't come free."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through songs like Darrel Worley's "Have You Forgotten," and Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the U.S.A.," Alan Jackson's "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)," Aaron Tippin's "Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly," Brooks and Dunn's "Only in America," and Charlie Daniels' "This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag," and Chely Wright's "Bumper of my SUV," the thoughts and emotions of everyday Americans rings out all across America through country music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>These musicians and their patriotic radio stations that air their songs of support for the military are to be commended for being on the front lines of encouragement to our remarkable, relentless troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many in this House, I've been to Iraq; but also many of our country music singers have gone overseas to Iraq and every other place where American troops are, at their own expense to show appreciation to our American military for their loyalty to the U.S.A.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's fitting that we as a Congress take note of this and honor country music during the month of October. I urge adoption of the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, country songs foster an appreciation of the many important sacrifices made by soldiers serving in the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to share with our Members of the House that tomorrow, Tuesday, I will be accompanying Sergeant Daniel Pena from my congressional district, a young man 28 years old serving his third tour in Iraq. While on patrol, their Humvee stepped on a land mine that exploded. One of his colleagues riding in that Humvee was killed, and he lost his right arm and his right leg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came back to the United States where he has stayed in Walter Reed the last 2 months and received an artificial arm and leg and has now been released by Walter Reed Hospital. I'm going to accompany him and his father and mother to Weslaco, Texas, where he is going to receive a hero's welcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to tell you that I requested that country songs like "Only in America" by Brooks and Dunn and "Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly" by Aaron Tippin be played as part of the patriotic music that we're going to have at that celebration of a hero's welcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no other speakers on this resolution, and I yield back my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
