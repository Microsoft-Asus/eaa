    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Monroe City, MO, on the 150th Anniversary of its founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monroe City has had a long and proud history. The city was founded on July 4, 1857, by E.B. Talcott and John Duff at a picnic where town lots were sold. In 1869 Monroe City became an incorporated town, owing its existence to the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad and the Wabash Railroad. Due to the drive of the community's many entrepreneurs Monroe City enjoyed continued economic, agricultural, and structural growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 1870s an educational system was created with both public and parochial schools. In 1918, a Carnegie Library was built that is still owned and supported by the city of Monroe City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout its 150-year history, Monroe City has continued to flourish and has striven to maintain its concern for, and involvement in, the lives of its citizens. Members of this community have often assumed leadership positions in the community through participation in fire, police, and administration departments, as well as with their work with a variety of civic and church groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join with the State of Missouri in congratulating Monroe City on this important milestone and wishing them continued growth and success for the next 150 years.</paragraph>
