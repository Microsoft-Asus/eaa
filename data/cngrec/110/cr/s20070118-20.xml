    <paragraph>Mr. President, 10 years ago today, this country lost a leader and this Chamber lost a colleague, and Massachusetts lost a favorite son. Ten years ago today, cancer took Paul Tsongas from us prematurely at 55 years of age. He left three wonderful daughters: Ashley, Katina, and Molly, and his special and extraordinary wife Niki, and he left an enormous number of friends and people whom he touched and affected across the country, those who joined him to help reform our politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul was a very different kind of public person. He walked his own path. He walked to his own tune. Today we remember him and we join the people in Merrimack Valley and across Massachusetts and so many others who came to appreciate and respect him and learned a lot about him through his Presidential campaign. We honor a life that elevated those whom he knew, and the countless people he never met, but whose lives he affected through the things he fought for and believed in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Tsongas inspired with his optimism and his drive, his disarming humor, and his love of causes both distant and local. He was proud of his Greek heritage, proud of his roots as the son of a drycleaner, proud of Lowell, and he became a champion of environmental protection and expanding opportunity so the full measure of the American dream that he came to see as a young person himself was accessible to everybody else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He set a high standard for public service which he continued even after he left the Senate. He continued out of office to work across the aisle proving, with former Senator Warren Rudman and their Concord Coalition, that balancing the budget was not a partisan agenda item and that fiscal discipline could, in fact, invigorate and not stifle the American economy. Paul Tsongas was a Democratic deficit hawk before it was popular and, I might add, together with Senator Gary Hart, was part of that  new vanguard that helped to define the defense issues of our Nation in a modern context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He understood also that being a Democrat did not mean being antibusiness. In Lowell, Paul served as a city councilor and then later as a reformed county commissioner. He loved Lowell. He loved that old mill town where he was born. Even at the end of his life, he knew every single person there, from Main Street through the largest businesses, and he could still see where he had grown up from the house where he lived in his last days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul came to Washington, where he worked with Tip O'Neill, Joe Moakley, Republican Sil Conte, and Ed Brooke in a bipartisan, golden age for the Massachusetts delegation. Paul's love of ideas and his love of Lowell helped trigger one of the earliest sparks of high-tech innovation in Massachusetts. Through his championing of early computer companies such as Wang and others, he helped to fuel the whole era of such stunning ingenuity that it changed the face of America and enhanced our technological  leadership in the world. Paul helped Lowell reinvent itself after years of decline, and in 1978, he was elected to the Senate. After one term only in the Senate, he gave up his seat in order to be with his family and fight cancer. He was sustained by the loving support of his sister, his wife, and his daughters, whom he treasured. Paul at age 7, had lost his own mother to tuberculosis, so this idea of being with</paragraph>
    <paragraph>family during that kind of crucial time was particularly poignant to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a friend of Paul's famously told him: No man ever died wishing he had spent more time with his business. Paul was first diagnosed with cancer in 1983 and he fought it courageously from that day forward. Right to the end of his life, he was tenacious in his support for the causes he believed in, in his fight against the devastating disease that eventually took him but never stole his spirit. Instead, he brought to the fight the same optimism and determination that made him so successful in  the Peace Corps. In 1992, when in remission, Paul ran for the Presidency, and he ran one of the most bracingly honest and politically courageous Presidential campaigns of our time. His was a campaign defined by common sense and by that wry sense of humor more than it was defined by fiery oratory. He managed to win Democratic primaries in New Hampshire and three other primaries and four State caucuses before the man from Lowell finally ceded the nomination to the man from Hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul reached across the country to the distant shores of the Pacific as coauthor of the Alaska Lands Act, which protected millions of acres of pristine wilderness. He made an admirable contribution to our environment. His aggressive policies to protect our natural resources were truly an investment in our future. He made life-long friends in Ethiopia as a result of his Peace Corps service in the early 1960s, proving even as a young man that his sense of the world reached beyond the horizon and  to cultures far from his roots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, in Lowell, the name Tsongas graces a museum of industrial history, part of the National Park Service, where the full story, both good and bad, of the industrial revolution and the textile industry in Massachusetts is presented for thousands of visitors, young and old, every year. Today, the name Tsongas graces an arena where athletic excellence, a passion dear to Paul's heart, is practiced along with political conventions and trade shows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise today not only as the Senator who inherited his seat; I rise as an admirer and a friend. To know Paul Tsongas was to see up close what this business we work in means in people's lives, and the full arch of his time on Earth illuminates the larger impact each of us can have on our communities, on our State, and on our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this day is special for this Chamber, a sad, proud memory for Lowell and for Massachusetts, and a moment to reflect on Paul's life and his contributions. It is hard to believe Senator Tsongas has been gone for 10 years. If he were with us today, Paul would be a strong voice full of insight, humor, and wisdom, all in that inimitable style, once modest, but incredibly forceful, the style we came to know and appreciate so much. Lowell, MA will miss Paul Tsongas, America misses him, but  we remember him today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to join my colleague, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, to mark a significant and sad anniversary. Ten years ago today, America lost a great patriot, Massachusetts lost a great advocate, and JOHN KERRY and I lost a great friend when Paul Tsongas passed away after a valiant and courageous fight with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Tsongas was the epitome of a public servant. From his time in the Peace Corps in both Ethiopia and the West Indies in the 1960s through his spirited campaign for the Presidency in 1992, Paul lived by the words my brother Jack believed so strongly, that each of us can make a difference and all of us should try.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Tsongas tried his best to do so, all his life, and he made a large and continuing difference. To the people of his beloved Lowell, he proved that our great industrial cities can be reborn and renewed, with a creative emphasis on reshaping their great history to meet the needs of our current high tech economy. In the 1970s and 1980s, when America was moving inexorably to the suburbs and so many of our great urban centers were being hollowed out, many of our people found it increasingly difficult  to see a bright future for urban areas decimated by the decline of manufacturing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today, across the country, a new movement has been born to encourage creative investment in our cities, and  one of the first models for how such efforts can succeed is the vision Paul Tsongas had for Lowell, MA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>F. Scott Fitzgerald may have said there are no second acts in American life, but Paul Tsongas could have responded, "Let him come to Lowell."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul served in the House and joined me in the Senate in 1978. He was someone I knew I could always count on to fight hard for the people of Massachusetts, and the Nation. He was tireless, determined, and always well prepared. Sometimes we would disagree on policy matters, here and there, but if you were going to challenge Paul, you had better have your facts straight because he knew what he was talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also was an outstanding campaigner. The conventional wisdom in politics has always been--at least as long as I can remember--that candidates with difficult to pronounce names have a small additional hurdle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul had a silent "t" at the beginning of his name, and I will never forget how brilliantly he turned that small disadvantage into a major asset in his victorious campaigns for elective office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He ran hilarious ads that had all these people struggling to pronounce his name, and none of them could do it. But by the end of the campaign, every voter could do the silent "t" and everyone loved the candidate who made fun of himself on TV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its is a lesson that Paul would carry on throughout his courageous battle against cancer. Everyone faces obstacles--some great and some small. It's how we choose to deal with them that makes us who we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Tsongas was an inspiration to all who knew him. The son of a Greek immigrant father and a mother who died of tuberculosis, he demonstrated again and again that through hard work, commitment, and a passion for doing what is right, all things are possible in our America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He charted a new course for the city he loved. He authored the Alaska Lands Act to protect millions of acres of American wilderness, and he founded, with our former colleague, Warren Rudman, the Concord Coalition, which has become a highly respected force for fiscal responsibility since its creation in the early 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the diagnosis of cancer was made, he left the Senate to spend more time with his wonderful wife Niki, his loving sister Thaleia, and his three daughters, Ashley, Katina, and Molly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After completing his rigorous treatment, he threw his hat in the Presidential ring in the 1992 primaries and his candidacy helped fuel the movement to make Government accountable for its fiscal policies. He left an immense and enduring legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We miss you, Paul. We miss your bravery and your commitment. We miss your friendship and concern, but we know you are resting in peace today after an extraordinary and well-lived life.</paragraph>
