    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I have indicated, it is too bad we will not be working tomorrow until late in the evening. Let the record be clear as to why that is happening. I ask Senators, though, to be aware that there will be a rollcall vote at 6 o'clock tomorrow on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="2831">H.R. 2831</bill>, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.</paragraph>
