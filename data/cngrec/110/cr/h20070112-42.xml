    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I first want to congratulate the Speaker for the opportunity he has to preside today. Congratulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, Congress passed a Medicare bill that for the first time created an opportunity for many seniors to have access to strong, valuable and persistent prescription drug coverage. Although the legislation was a compromise, and in places an imperfect one, this program has proven to be a success, working for seniors with a range of circumstances and particularly valuable resource for seniors of the most limited means, many of whom are in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It falls on us in this Congress to consider ways that we can further strengthen this benefit. Unfortunately, the legislation that we have debated today, <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>, is a huge and real step back and is less of a policy than a bumper sticker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this program, I am deeply disappointed that we had no hearings, no discussion and no opportunity for amendments to produce a real pricing reform bill with teeth and with nuance. While part D is not perfect and can be improved, it is our fundamental responsibility to put in place a policy that might build on the successes of the program, and they are substantial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Independent estimates for the Medicare part D prescription drug benefit for the fiscal year 2008 budget cycle show that net Medicare costs are 30 percent less, about $190 billion lower than were originally predicted when the benefit was created in 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In addition, based on strong competitive bidding by health care plans for 2007, average monthly premiums will be approximately $22 for beneficiaries, down from $23 in 2006 if enrollees remain in their current plans. The initial estimate for 2006 premiums was $37. CMS has indicated that beneficiaries are saving on the average of $1,200 annually on their drugs, and these are achievements that must be preserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people in my district like the idea of the legislation which the House Democrats put forward today. I understand how they feel. I have long felt that we could improve on the existing policy and the existing process. But what I found was that the Democrats' plan is more of a political stunt than a solution. And it isn't at all a prescription for real reform, and it is, at best, a placebo, but one that could actually reduce the benefits and the coverage for many individual seniors. To understand  why, we need to recognize how much this proposal has been criticized. Even leading liberals like Urban Institute president Robert Reischauer and Brookings Institution senior fellow Alice Rivlin have expressed real qualms about an initiative that limits choices for seniors by putting government bureaucrats in charge of setting prices for prescription drugs. Reischauer recently said to The Washington Post: "People were worried no private plans would</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rivlin stated: "It's not clear that a government, particularly this government, would get a better deal from the drug companies by direct negotiations than the drug plans can get on their own, and it might have some negative consequences."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also want to recognize that the new majority has claimed that their proposal will provide significant savings, when, in fact, the CBO, nonpartisan, has announced that <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill> would in their view have no budget savings and a negligible effect on Federal spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reasons why I felt, as an advocate and caretaker for this program, obliged to oppose <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill> are clear: one, this measure is not going to generate savings for the consumer; two, government price-setting will only drive drugs out of the program and reduce seniors' access to critical drugs that may be central to their treatment as individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This plan could potentially, three, limit seniors' access to their community pharmacies. For many seniors, advice from their pharmacist is a critical service that they need to have access to to coordinate their drug uses and find the best coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, four, finally, this plan could lead to increased drug prices for America's vets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe we could improve on this legislation, and I will speak next week about some further ideas. I believe that there is a significant difference between the plan we have and the VA plan; and if we don't recognize those differences, we are going to shortchange seniors, and this bill that we voted on today will generate no savings. And I hope when it comes back from the Senate, that there will be an opportunity to substantially correct it, put teeth into it and create a real nuanced  policy that will add to the successes of our part D program.</paragraph>
