  <narrative>ESTABLISHING A QUADRENNIAL NATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8732]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation this evening requiring the establishment of a Quadrennial National Security Review. I am joined in this effort by my friend and colleague on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) who has been an advocate for enhanced interagency cooperation and improved strategic planning on national security issues. His input and support on this bill have been invaluable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure has the support of Armed Services Committee Chairman Skelton, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lantos, and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Thompson, as well as numerous other Members with strong national security credentials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the United States establishes its national security goals in the National Security Strategy, required by law to be submitted annually to Congress. However, only two versions have been published in the last 6 years and those documents provide little insight into how we can harness all assets of national power to achieve our national security goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many experts in the field of national security, including members of the 9/11 Commission, have emphasized the importance of using all of our Nation's capabilities and levers of influence to advance our national security goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Joe Nye, the former dean of the Kennedy School of Government and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, has written extensively about the need to supplement our military might with "soft power," efforts to win the world's hearts and minds with our values and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Successfully exercising this type of power requires that we pursue many fronts, including international diplomacy, democracy building, cultural exchanges, economic development, educational initiatives, and communication about our values and ideals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though our Nation has many assets and capabilities to advance our national security goals, we have done a poor job of integrating them all. From my experience on the House Intelligence Committee, as well as the Homeland Security and Armed Services Committees, I am deeply concerned about the tendency of agencies with national security responsibilities to focus exclusively on their own programs' initiatives, while losing sight of the larger strategic goals, an unfortunate phenomenon that leads  to stovepiping when information and intelligence are not shared among Departments and agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we must ensure that all components of our Federal Government are working together toward the same purpose and that they are able to coordinate their efforts to the greatest extent possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its "Beyond Goldwater-Nichols" study, the Center for Strategic and International Studies recommended the establishment of a Quadrennial National Security Review to create an interagency process that would identify national security goals, assess existing needs and capabilities, establish priorities for funding, and recommend specific policy and budget proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From that recommendation, I have worked with other experts, Members of Congress, and committee staff to draft the legislation that we are introducing today. This bill would create a Quadrennial National Security Review, a process to coordinate all assets of national power and identify and achieve our national security objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the measure, every 4 years the President would conduct a review of the national security goals of the United States in consultation with all relevant national security related Departments and agencies, as well as Congress. The process would include a thorough investigation of America's national security interests and objectives, the strategy for implementing security goals, risk assessments, identification of all assets of national power needed to meet security goals, an explanation of  how agencies would coordinate their efforts, and an assessment of what additional resources are needed. The effort would culminate in a comprehensive national security strategy document, policy recommendations, and a unified security budget proposal that reflects national security priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, after publication of the QNSR, an outside panel of the national security experts would conduct independent review and perform their own analysis, reporting their findings to Congress and the administration within 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that the establishment of a QNSR and an independent review process will lead to greater coordination and cooperation and facilitate strategic budget and resource decision-making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to thank the many Members, staff and national security experts who have provided feedback and guidance in the crafting of this bill. It is not an easy task to move our entire national security decision-making structure forward from the status quo, but I know many people in this body recognize the importance of doing so, and I am optimistic that we are moving in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to join me in this vital effort.</paragraph>
