    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last night, the Democratic majority leadership was in the process of attempting to violate the House of Representatives' rules by holding a vote open with the sole intent of changing the outcome of the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the vote changed from 214 "yeas" to 214 "nays" to 215 "yeas" to 213 "nays," the Speaker pro tempore brought down the gavel. Because he then realized the vote was in favor of the Republican motion, he didn't know what to do. The lighted scoreboard at either end of the Chamber showed 215 "yeas" to 213 "nays."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the Speaker and Parliamentarian allowed two more Democrats to change their vote. So the vote finally announced was 212 "yeas" and 216 "nays." The Parliamentarian said the vote was actually 214-214 when the vote closed. However, of course, he had no explanation for why the vote was officially called. He allowed the vote switching to continue until the vote became what it was announced. That is clearly because there is no proper explanation other than that, on the way to violating one  rule, it became necessary to violate another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also noteworthy that the vote was to further enable people who are breaking the law in America by being here illegally to not only break the law but receive money from those forced to pay taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then came the astounding news that the record was wiped clean of the computer evidence of what went wrong. When rules and laws don't matter, we change the destiny of history.</paragraph>
