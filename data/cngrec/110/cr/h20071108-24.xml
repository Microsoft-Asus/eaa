    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this country must keep its promises made to our servicemen and -women when they choose to serve our country by taking care of them when they return home as veterans. This Democratic Congress has been dedicated to making sure the needs of all America's veterans are fulfilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far this year we've passed legislation providing the largest funding increase for veterans in the 77-year history of the VA. This funding will allow the VA to keep up with the growing number of veterans who need care, maintain its health care facilities, and treat veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who are suffering from PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also voted to increase military pay by 3.5 percent, as well as special pay and bonuses to combat troops, putting an additional $7.3 billion in military paychecks. Unfortunately, the Bush administration is now reneging on these enlistment bonuses to those severely wounded combat veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress has made meeting the needs of the veterans and our military a top priority. This weekend, and every day, let us all remember the service of our Nation's veterans and commit ourselves to keeping this country's promises to them.</paragraph>
