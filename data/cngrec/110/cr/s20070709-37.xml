    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 13 to 15, the residents of Arthur will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arthur is a small town in eastern North Dakota with a population of 402. Despite its small size, Arthur holds an important place in North Dakota's history. Originally named Rosedale, the settlement was renamed Arthur in 1881 in honor of Chester Alan Arthur, the 21st President of the United States. The post office was established in 1881, as was the lumber yard and the first general store, the Hall-Larson Store. Arthur was incorporated as a village in 1921.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the economy of Arthur is largely based on agriculture. The Arthur Mercantile, the First State Bank, and the Arthur Companies are family businesses that have been present in the community for over 100 years. This is a remarkable feat for such a small town. The town is also home to the Arthur Center, a notable good samaritan center, which will celebrate its 80th anniversary this summer, and two churches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arthur's motto "small town, big heart" truly captures the essence of the town and its residents. The people of Arthur enjoy socializing, attending sporting events, and working together for the betterment of the community. The town has an exciting celebration planned that includes an all-school reunion, a parade, a fireman's rodeo, street dance, community worship, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Arthur, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Arthur and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Arthur that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arthur has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
