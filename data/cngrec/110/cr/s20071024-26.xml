    <paragraph>Mr. President, I voted, yesterday, in favor of the Ensign amendment to deny credit toward Social Security benefits claimed in violation of the Social Security Act. This would deny benefits to people, including undocumented workers, who have, in the words of the act, "willfully, knowingly, and with the intent to deceive used false Social Security numbers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ensign amendment was more carefully focused on denying benefits based on illegal use of a fake Social Security number, unlike previous Ensign amendments which I did not support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday's Ensign amendment requires the Commissioner of Social Security to deny Social Security benefits for work performed by any individual using a Social Security account number which was not his, in violation of section 208 of the Social Security Act at 42 U.S.C. 408.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ensign amendment was adopted yesterday by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment differs from a previous amendment offered by Senator Ensign in the 109th Congress, which could have harmed senior citizens and other individuals who may have made an honest error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That amendment was rejected by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July of 2007, Senator Ensign proposed an amendment to the College Cost Reduction Act which could have  led to a highly unfair loss of benefits to naturalized citizens or others who are legally present. The provisions of that amendment would have posed great problems because it would have denied Social Security benefits to legally naturalized citizens, for instance, unless the Social Security Administration could affirmatively determine that  the individual was legally authorized to work. This amendment would have placed an unmanageable burden on the Social Security Administration and seniors who have been legally present for decades, who could have unfairly lost their benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also failed in the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Social Security Administration, SSA, is currently facing nothing short of a crisis when it comes to processing disability claims. Indeed, SSA Commissioner Michael Astrue has called this issue his agency's most pressing challenge. Currently, there are over 756,000 individuals who are waiting for a hearing to have their claims adjudicated, and the average wait time is a staggering 512 days. That is the longest amount of time in SSA's history. In contrast, in 2001,  disability applicants had to wait an average of 308 days for a hearing. While that was still far too long, individuals now have to wait 66 percent longer. Sadly, some people have died waiting for a hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help the SSA process disability claims more quickly, I was proud that, yesterday, the Senate voted 88 to 6 to approve an amendment to the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that Senators BINGAMAN, BAUCUS, and I offered to increase funds dedicated to the agency's administrative costs by $150 million. We believe that this added funding will help the SSA reduce its disability backlog and enable individuals to access the  benefits to which they are entitled and need for their basic living expenses. Because of the financial strains on applicants and their families, it is simply unconscionable to have individuals waiting for upwards of 2 years before they receive ruling on their disability claims. We can and must do better--it is our moral obligation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I strongly believe that providing the SSA with additional resources is warranted, I would like to thank the two managers of the Labor-HHS bill--Senators HARKIN and SPECTER--for working so hard to increase funding for the SSA and for supporting our amendment. It is notable that the underlying bill they brought to the Senate floor would have provided $9.72 billion for the SSA in fiscal year 2008, an increase of $426.4 million over fiscal year 2007 and $125 million over President  Bush's fiscal year 2008 budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that we have underfunded the SSA for years and must begin to reverse this trend. Indeed, according to SSA data, one reason wait times for disability hearings have risen so precipitously is that between fiscal years 2001 and 2007, Congress provided on average $150 million less than President Bush requested for the agency. At the same time, Congress gave SSA more work, including the responsibility to review Medicare beneficiaries' income and determine whether they should be charged  higher premiums or if they are eligible for assistance to pay for premiums and fees in the Medicare prescription drug program. I would note that last year, Congress had to include an additional $36.6 million in the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution just to prevent the agency from furloughing each of its employees for 10 days, as well as close offices around the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would also like to thank the Senate for unanimously adopting a second amendment on Monday that I offered to require the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to evaluate the SSA's plan to both reduce the disability hearing backlog and improve disability benefits processing. Senators HARKIN and SPECTER presciently asked for the SSA to produce this report when the Appropriations Committee approved the underlying Labor-HHS bill. Commissioner Astrue submitted his Agency's  plan to Congress on September 13.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it would be extraordinarily useful for GAO to look at the SSA's plan and make recommendations to make it even more effective. The bottom line is that we know that it is crucial that we ensure that the plan to rectify problems of disability processing will be productive. While the SSA has been among our most efficient agencies, this GAO evaluation will help ensure that the plan put in place will best use the funds we are acting to provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in closing, I hope that conferees will retain the two SSA administrative costs amendments the Senate adopted so resoundingly this week in the forthcoming Labor-HHS conference report, so that President Bush may sign them into law. This Nation's disabled deserve nothing less.</paragraph>
