  <narrative>NATIONAL PUBLIC LANDS DAY -- (Senate - October 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12377">S12377</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this past Saturday was National Public Lands Day. On September 29, hundreds of thousands of citizens from across the country volunteered to give their time to improve our public lands. These volunteers cleared obstructed trails, picked up litter, planted trees, removed invasive species, and taught young Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts about camping. I commend all volunteers for their commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now in its 14th year, National Public Lands Day has become the largest grassroots volunteer effort on behalf of our public parks, rivers, lakes, forests, rangelands, and beaches. Last year, an estimated $11 million worth of labor intensive work was carried out, and this year it is expected that $12 million of improvements were added to America's public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday, September 27, the front page of USA Today displayed a picture of Coeur d'Alene, ID, with a headline that read "No end in sight for Idaho's growth." The article went on to provide a breakdown of how Idaho's economy has remained strong despite the current slump in the housing market. It reads, "[An] ingredient in Idaho's boom has been the "amenities business"--hiking, hunting, fishing, skiing, whitewater rafting--that attracts tourists and new residents, from billionaires to  young outdoor enthusiasts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today Idaho is experiencing a new brand of tourists and a new brand of neighbors moving in down the street. These people are focused on the vigorous quest for a quality of life that includes the enjoyment of the outdoors. What ties the third generation Idahoan to a newcomer is an appreciation for the resources and the value that multiple uses contribute to our livelihoods and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USA Today article also points out that "[t]he federal government owns about two-thirds of the land in Idaho, mostly national forests. The state has 21 million acres of roadless wilderness, about the size of South Carolina and more than any state except Alaska." Public lands have much to offer and are very beneficial for Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a myriad of different resources that can be responsibly harvested or extracted from our public lands. From sustainably managed forests to livestock use to oil and geothermal potential, these lands hold the resources Americans rely on to achieve the standard of living that we have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Using the resources on our own public lands, as opposed to relying on foreign resources, affords us the opportunity to fund schools, highways, and national defense, all the while easing the financial burden on the taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are those, however, who would prefer to see land management agencies take more of a preservationist role, prohibiting access to our national forests, parks, beaches, and rangelands and leaving nature to run its course. This is not a value that many Idahoans hold, and neither do I.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must actively manage our lands so that the recreational and resource benefit can be utilized by every American citizen. Under certain circumstances, active management includes limited access in specific areas;  however, we must be cautious not to be overly restrictive of public access to public lands. The same holds true for natural resource management. We cannot use a one-size-fits-all management style when there are so many differing opinions on  how to best utilize our domestic natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I want to again say thank you to the volunteers for their tremendous efforts to ensure that the public lands we enjoy today will be enjoyed by many, for years to come.</paragraph>
