    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, truckers from Tennessee are visiting me this week, many of whom are operating at a net loss because of oil and gas prices. Gas prices are at historic highs. Residents of Clarksville, Tennessee are paying $51 for a 15-gallon tank of gas. That's a difference of $18.45 since January 2007 when Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat leadership gained control of Congress and began making promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They continue to wax eloquent about the future of energy. Their words sound promising, but the reality is, they're as empty as a lot of our gas tanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what have they been doing? They have not encouraged domestic production, but have sought to remove exploration incentives that would promote energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are calling on this Congress for action. So let's take some action. Let's invest, explore and provide opportunities for American innovation to develop reliable, affordable energy for years to come.</paragraph>
