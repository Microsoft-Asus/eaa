  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Master Sergeant Woodrow Wilson Keeble, a South  Dakota hero, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Master Sergeant Keeble was born in Waubay, SD, and was a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate. He served in the Army in both World War II and the Korean war, and was highly decorated for his service having been awarded two Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, the Combat Infantryman Badge, and the Distinguished Service Cross.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The action for which Master Sergeant Keeble was awarded the Medal of Honor occurred in October 1951 near Kumsong, North Korea. The accounts of his actions that day are truly worthy of a Hollywood movie. Though wounded and having fought continually for several days in brutally cold weather, Master Sergeant Keeble single-handedly took out three machine gun emplacements which had pinned down U.S. troops. As a result, U.S. troops were able to achieve their objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First Sergeant Joe K. Sagami described the action this way:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He worked his way down about fifty yards from the ridgeline and flanked the enemy's left pillbox; attacking it with grenades and rifle fire eliminating it. He then retreated to about the point where the First Platoon was holding the unit's first line of defense and worked down about fifty yards from the ridgeline and proceeded to outflank the enemy's right pillbox with grenades eliminating it. Then without hesitation he lobbed a grenade into the back entrance of the middle pillbox and with additional  fire eliminated it. He then ordered his First Platoon forward to eliminate what little resistance was left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In reading the words of those who fought with Master Sergeant Keeble, which have been collected by researcher Merry Helm, it is clear that everyone loved and respected the man they called Chief. Joseph Marston of George Company said, "What `Chief' accomplished that day was common knowledge throughout the whole battalion. He was known for his bravery."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When asked about Master Sergeant Keeble, Carl Fetzner, who served in Second Platoon, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sure I remember him. Nobody could forget him! I had barely gotten to the company when this happened. I didn't know much about what was going on, but I do know SGT Keeble was the finest, most courageous person I ever knew. When we pulled back in reserve--you know when we could go [back from] the lines to clean up, whatever, take a little rest ..... he knew what was going on. He took care of his men, he liked people, and he always did everything he could to help you, especially the new men ......</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the Korean war, Master Sergeant Keeble came home and went to work at the Wahpeton Indian School. He enjoyed making copper sculptures and was active in his community. Like so many veterans, he was more concerned about taking care of his family than collecting medals. At the time, few even knew that the members of his own company had submitted a recommendation that he be awarded a Medal of Honor for his brave action in October 1951.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the recommendation paperwork had been lost twice, Master Sergeant Keeble did not receive the honor his fellow soldiers knew he deserved. It all might have been forgotten if the men he served with, and later his family and friends, had not kept the issue alive for the next five decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Master Sergeant Keeble's case was first brought to my attention in 2002 by his family and members of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate. At that time, I contacted the Secretary of the Army asking that Master Sergeant Keeble's case be reconsidered based on the loss of the original recommendation paperwork. The case was bolstered by original documents and affidavits that had been saved by those who served with Master Sergeant Keeble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though it has taken many years of work by many people, countless letters and phone calls, and even legislation passed in May 2007 authorizing the President to act, President Bush recently approved the recommendation and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to Master Sergeant Keeble's family this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I never had the opportunity to meet Master Sergeant Keeble who died in 1982, but it has been an honor to get to know more about him by working with his family over the past 6 years. I want to thank his family and friends, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, and all the people of South Dakota who have fought to secure this much-deserved honor for Master Sergeant Keeble. I also want to say a special word about his wife Blossom, who died last year. I wish we could have gotten Master Sergeant Keeble this  recognition before Blossom passed away, but thankfully she knew how close we were to getting this done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when so many young men and women are deployed in dangerous places in defense of our country, it is important that we honor all of those who have served our nation in uniform. While we owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid, I am proud that today we have properly thanked a South Dakota hero for his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I join with my colleagues and all South Dakotans in honoring Master Sergeant Keeble for his service to our nation and congratulating his family on receiving his Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
