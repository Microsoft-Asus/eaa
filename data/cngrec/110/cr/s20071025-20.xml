    <paragraph>Mr. President, there will be no votes tomorrow. We have announced long since that we would have no votes Monday. We have a lot we are going to do Tuesday, the first of which is to complete the work on the important Amtrak legislation. There has been great progress made on that today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have had an interesting week. We may not be happy with the results--I say that because some are happy, some are not--but it has been a productive week. It has been a week in which, in spite of the divisiveness of the issues before us, they have been handled in a very collegial way. There have been strong feelings expressed on both sides, but it has been done, I think, in a way that brings credit to the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, just briefly, a couple of other observations, I would say that I know it is the position of the Senator from New Hampshire--of course, he can speak for himself, but it is the position of the Senator from New Hampshire, myself, and many others that we make this moratorium permanent. I think that still ought to be our goal in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the week that is now coming to a conclusion, I would have to state it has been quite a good week, with a number of achievements that  are important for the Senate and, in particular, the confirmation of Judge Southwick, which was not only important to the State of Mississippi but important to this institution, the Senate, in terms of how we are going to treat nominees in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300019" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me add a couple comments with respect to the legislation we just passed by unanimous consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The adoption of this legislation comes after a very tough negotiation that goes back not just a couple days or a couple weeks or a couple months but literally years, almost a decade. In tough negotiations, not everyone is happy. But I think the American people basically want us to figure out how to get work done. The American people look for us to set aside partisan differences, and they want to see some results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is, for the most part, they come to understand what we have done here tonight and realize the House still has to speak on this matter. The American people will, if not applaud the actual results, some of which are not easily understood, at least say: Well, on this matter, at least, the U.S. Senate figured out how to work together. A couple guys from small States got together, along with the help of a bunch of others, including Senators Alexander and Enzi and &lt;em&gt;Voinovich.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think among the most important results that flow from the adoption of this legislation are, No. 1, we preserve the intent in the 1998 initial Internet moratorium legislation. What we wanted to do in 1998 was not to allow additional States and additional local governments to place a tax on access to the Internet, if you will, a tax on our AOL bills. That was part of the 1998 legislation that said for a handful of States--nine or so--that were already doing that, they were allowed to continue  to do so but nobody else could pile on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation today makes sure we are not going to be allowing additional access taxes or additional taxes by State and local governments for access to the Internet. That protects the consumers, but it also does it in a way that I think is fair to the States. Because 3 years before the 1998 legislation was passed--3 years prior--in 1995, this same Congress passed legislation saying that the unfunded mandates were a bad idea, and that the Federal Government was not going to tell State and local  governments how to spend their money without providing that money, the Federal Government was not going to take away the ability of State and local governments to raise money without providing for funds to make up for the shortfall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have done is we have protected the States that are already deriving revenues from access taxes on the Internet. We said we are not going to allow, as we go forward with new innovations--for, if you will, telecom companies, telephone companies--we are not going to allow them to bundle services and begin to offer those bundled services--traditionally taxed by State and local governments, in some cases--and ship them over on the Internet to avoid all State and local taxes. So the States  have spoken loudly: Do not take away our revenue base. We have been responsive to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Governor for 8 years in my State, and as, at one time, the chairman of the National Governors Association, I never liked it when the Federal Government came in and said: Spend your money this way or that way, without giving us the  money. I never liked it when the Federal Government came in and said: We are going to take your ability to raise money away without providing for the shortfall. I think we are consistent here and true to the concerns that have been raised by State and local governments on that score.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third thing we have done--I sort of alluded to it--the technology in this area continues to change dramatically. I like to kid, but I say 5 years ago I could not even spell VOIP, Voice Over Internet Protocol, which basically means sending telephone services over the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Actually, 5 years ago, the idea of being able to do that was, I think, a gleam in somebody's eye. Today it is common practice. Not only that, we have the ability to send something called IPTV, Internet Protocol TV, to send television signals over the Internet. In my State, we do not necessarily raise our revenues this way. But some places do. They raise some of the revenues for educational purposes, for paramedics, for fire services, for police services. They raise their revenues by taxing telephone  services and cable services. It is inappropriate for us to come and say: You cannot do that, even as those services are somehow transferred and transmitted over the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we have done, by not making the moratorium permanent, is we have made sure we are going to come back and revisit this issue somewhere down the line. We say 7 years. The House says 4 years. We will have the opportunity and the requirement to come back and revisit this issue. If the technology changes--and it will. I can tell you one thing for sure, the technology that is in place today is not going to be same in 4, 5, 6, 7 years, just as it was not 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 years ago. It has continued  to change. By virtue of this legislation, we will be better prepared for that change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I close with this: When I talk to people in our State, and in other States as well, when I hear about the low regard people have for the Congress and, frankly, for the administration--but we will stick with us right now--one of the things that people are most unhappy about is our seeming inability to work together, to hang in there, until we have been able to carve out, find a middle ground that is responsive to the concerns of most people. We have done that. It has not been easy, but  we have been persistent, and I think ultimately--at least tonight, today--successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to have been a part of this effort and to have had a chance to work with our Senators Alexander, Stevens, Inouye, McCain, and Senator Sununu.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Hampshire.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to stand up tonight, after Senator Carper, which is very appropriate, to talk about this success. The Senator from Delaware has described, I think very clearly, the strength of this legislation, the value of the legislation, and the importance of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We really do have a responsibility to act in our role as a Congress to prevent Internet access taxes. Because this is a national--and, in fact, global--communications network. It is a national and global network for commerce and business as well. That is our responsibility under the Constitution to make sure there are not unnecessary, undue burdens on interstate commerce and trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we have done tonight is to take legislation that was passed in the House and really improve it dramatically. Senator McConnell indicated we have nearly doubled the length. We added clarification language as to what could and could not be taxed, and how the grandfathered States that were taxing prior to 1998 would be treated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also added explicit language to make sure that Internet services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, could not be taxed. This is an important issue for me and many others, particularly Senator Wyden from Oregon, who spoke about it today on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that consumers know that Internet access is not going to be taxed, first and foremost, because taxes raise the price of something. I do not think Congress wants to be in the position of allowing the price and the cost of Internet access for every consumer in America to go up. We do not want to be in the position of raising the cost of Internet access as well because it would affect the pace of investments and the incentives to make investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anytime you tax something, you are going to get less of it. This ban on Internet taxes is extremely important. I would like to make the ban permanent. I think the time has come to make it permanent. After passing it in 1998, and extending it in 2001 and 2004, to look at yet another short-term extension does not seem to make as much sense to me as making the ban on access taxes permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at the same  time, we need to recognize that a 7-year extension is the longest extension we have ever had, and that alone I think should make us very proud of the work that was done, and it was bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of members of the Commerce Committee worked very hard on this issue. Senator Carper certainly spent a lot of time on this issue. We haven't always agreed on every aspect of the legislation, but we can agree, and we have agreed, on this 7-year extension tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to make special mention of Senator Inouye, one of the Senators who was mentioned earlier as well. He is the chairman of the Commerce Committee. It was very frustrating to me that we never had a chance to vote on this legislation in the Commerce Committee, but he and his staff didn't stop working on the issue, and they put in a tremendous effort today to work through all of the details that are required. Even if it only takes the Senate 32 seconds to make a unanimous consent  request to pass the final product, that 32 seconds has behind it hours and hours of work by many Members of the Senate and many more staff members. So I appreciate Senator Inouye's work and the work of the staff as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased we are sending this to the House tonight, but also pleased to note that we are doing it before the expiration of the current moratorium. The last extension was passed in 2004 and expires on November 1, or next Thursday. It is not that often, unfortunately, that Congress does something in a fairly timely way. So to pass this legislation tonight in advance of that expiration date adds a little bit more satisfaction, knowing we did the right thing, and that we did it on time. I am pleased  to support the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300019" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me take one more minute on this subject to also extend my thanks and compliments to our staffs. On my staff, Bill Ghent and Chris Prendergast worked long and hard for many hours. Our Commerce Committee staff, both Democrat and Republican, did a terrific job under the leadership of Senator Inouye, and we are deeply grateful to him and to Senator Stevens' staff for the wonderful work they did. The Commerce staff works in a way I wish every committee  staff and subcommittee staff would--Democrat, Republican, majority, minority--it is almost seamless the way they approach almost every issue, including this one. I think one of the things that happens when you work like that is you get something done. While it is not unanimous acclaim for what we have done here, I think for the most part it is good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we live to see what happens over in the House, hopefully we will be able to resolve our differences with them.</paragraph>
