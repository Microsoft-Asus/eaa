  <narrative>WHAT IS AT STAKE -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2209]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday, General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker presented their reports to Congress. Their testimonies were professional, fact-driven accounts, and I am extremely grateful for their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the hearing, I summarized al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri, who has outlined his plan for Iraq. The first stage, expel the Americans from Iraq. The second stage, establish authority in Iraq. The third stage, extend the jihad wave to the secular nations neighboring Iraq. And the fourth stage, the clash with Israel and extermination of the people of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ambassador Crocker acknowledged these goals, but said al Qaeda may not follow this timeline. They may try to attack America as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ambassador also agreed al Qaeda would not be satisfied with simply the destruction of the people of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should remember what is at stake in Iraq. A failure in Iraq, a defeat at the hands of these extremists, would mean a failed state, a breeding ground for extremists. It is the scenario we saw in Afghanistan prior to 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
