  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas in 1932, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., then president of General Motors Corporation, and other civic leaders had the foresight to found the National Highway Users Conference for the purpose of working "for good, all-weather roads in every state";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1970, the National Highway Users Conference merged with the Automotive Safety Foundation to form the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility, which in 1995 was renamed as the American Highway Users Alliance (known as the "Highway Users");&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas since its founding, the Highway Users has been a persistent and outspoken proponent for adequate funding of the Nation's highway infrastructure and a consistent voice for motorists who use the highways for leisure, family, and business purposes and for those who depend on the Nation's transportation infrastructure for commercial purposes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Highway Users has voiced the interests of motorists and businesses on all major national highway and traffic safety legislation over the past 75 years, including the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the Interstate Highway System and established the Highway Trust Fund;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Highway Users has been a consistent force for protecting the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund and State highway trust funds;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas research conducted by the Highway Users has documented the promise and potential of modern United States highways in improving safety, facilitating emergency evacuations, and growing the national economy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Highway Users has been a strong advocate in favor of strengthening the national highway network by promoting a strong Federal role in mobility and safety and by advocating policies that benefit highway users: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes the American Highway Users Alliance on the occasion of its 75th anniversary;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) commends the many achievements of the American Highway Users Alliance; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) encourages the American Highway Users Alliance to continue its tradition of excellence in service to motorists and the transportation industry.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="hr" number="772">H. Res. 772</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="772">H. Res. 772</bill>, a resolution to congratulate the American Highway Users Alliance on the occasion of its 75th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1932 as the National Highway Users Conference, in 1970 the group merged with the Automotive Safety Foundation and were renamed the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility, and in 1995 they took on the current name of American Highway Users Alliance ("the Highway Users").</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Highway Users has always been an outspoken proponent for adequate funding for our Nation's highway infrastructure and a consistent voice for motorists and those who depend on our highways for commercial purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 75 years, Highway Users have expressed the interests of motorists and businesses on all major national highway and traffic safety legislation, including strong support for the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the Interstate Highway System, established the Highway Trust Fund. Since then, it's been an unwavering force for protecting the integrity of the Federal Highway Trust Fund and State Highway Trust Funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we received a report last week on the state of the Nation's infrastructure from a commission that was created by the passage of the SAFETEA-LU bill, we find that we are dramatically in deficit in investing in the Nation's infrastructure. And the current administration is dramatically in denial about the deficit in investing in infrastructure, so there will be a lot of work to be done by the American Highway Users Alliance and other advocates for an improved transportation network in the United  States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to also voice my support for House Resolution 772. House Resolution 772 was introduced by Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Highways and Transit Subcommittee Chairman DeFazio, and myself to recognize the 75th anniversary of the American Highway Users Alliance, a broad national coalition of organizations representing motorists and businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Highway Users Alliance is a nonprofit advocacy organization with the mission to promote safe, uncongested highways and enhanced mobility. The group's membership includes over 300 national trade associations, corporations, small businesses, and other State and local nonprofit groups. They represent over 45 million highway users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1932, the group has fought for road and bridge investments that will save lives, promote economic growth, improve quality of life, and protect freedom of mobility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Highway Users Alliance focuses its campaigns on fair highway use taxation, Federal highway policy and funding, and responsible environmental policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Highway Users Alliance is an important voice for the interests of motorists and businesses and has been an active participant in every major national highway and traffic safety law passed over the last 75 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this resolution and congratulate the American Highway Users Alliance on its achievements and on its 75th anniversary. Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="772">H. Res. 772</bill>, to congratulate American Highway Users Alliance on the occasion of its 75th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Highway Users Alliance ("Highway Users") has changed its name several times over 75 years. The group was  founded in 1932 as the National Highway Users Conference. In 1970, the group merged with the Automotive Safety Foundation and was renamed the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility. In 1995, the organization took on its current name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet no matter what the group was called, Highway Users has always been a persistent and outspoken proponent for adequate funding and oversight of the Nation's highway infrastructure, and a diligent voice for the interests of the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Highway Users has voiced the interests of motorists and businesses on all major national highway and traffic safety legislation over the past 75 years, including strong support of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which authorized the Interstate Highway System and established the Highway Trust Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Highway Users has worked tirelessly over the past 75 years to protect the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund and State highway trust funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The organization has conducted crucial research documenting the promise and potential of modern United States highways in improving safety, facilitating emergency evacuations, and growing the national economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Highway Users Alliance has also been a consistent advocate in favor of strengthening the national highway network by promoting a strong Federal role in mobility and safety and by advocating policies that benefit all highway users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these and other contributions to our daily lives, our economic well-being, and our health and safety, I rise to recognize the outstanding achievements of the American Highway Users Alliance and its sustained contribution in service to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and join me in commemorating the 75th anniversary of the American Highway Users Alliance.</paragraph>
