    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National Peace Corps Week and to honor more than 190,000 Peace Corps Volunteers from both my home State of New Mexico and across the Nation. Each year these courageous men and women embark on a 2 year journey to help develop the societies of 139 countries around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost 47 years ago, then Senator John F. Kennedy</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, over 8,000 volunteers are serving in the communities of 74 countries. Many Peace Corps volunteers from New Mexi co are currently posted in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Honduras. Volunteers range in age from 25 to 80, with varying levels of education including individuals with undergraduate and graduate degrees. Additionally, the Peace Corps offers programs that support academic studies once a term of service has concluded, which allows many volunteers to further their education after their self-sacrificing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The experience volunteers take back with them from their host countries helps shape the course of their li ves. Lifelong connections and friendships span these gaps of distance, and volunteers have the satisfaction of not only a job well done, but also of the positive image they created for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout this week of celebration, I encourage Americans to ask themselves, "What can I do for my country?"</paragraph>
