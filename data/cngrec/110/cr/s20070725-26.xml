  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO MORT BISHOP, JR. -- (Senate - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9914">S9914</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a native and resident of Pendleton, OR, I have enjoyed a lifelong affection for the Pendleton Round-Up, which is quite simply America's finest rodeo. Pendleton Woolen Mills locally based and family owned for more than 140 years has sponsored the Round-Up both financially and with merchandise for as long as I can remember. A great deal of credit for the continuing success of both the Round-Up and Woolen Mills is owed to the leadership and vision of&#xD0;C.M. "Mort"  Bishop, Jr. This remarkable Oregonian passed away on July 11 at the age of 82. I wish to pay tribute to his life and legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mort was a proud member of what has been termed the "greatest generation" and, like so many of that generation, he wore our country's uniform into battle during World War II. As a U.S. marine, Mort served with the 5th and 14th Battalions in the Pacific theater and participated in the liberation of Guam in July 1944.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After returning home from the war, Mort joined the family business: Pendleton Woolen Mills. Mort helped guide this iconic Oregon company for nearly 50 years, eventually succeeding his father as company president. Most recently, Mort served next to his brother, `Brot,' as co-vice chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even while managing a demanding business, Mort always found time to give back to his community and his State. From the Oregon Historical Society to the Boy Scouts of America, from Willamette University to the Oregon Wildlife Heritage Foundation and the University of Oregon Foundation, Mort generously gave his time, talent, and treasure to countless worthy causes. But let there be no doubt, the cause held closest to Mort's heart was the Pendleton Round Up. I knew that every September I could count  on seeing Mort and his wonderful family enjoying the nearly 100-year-old rodeo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mort also held a close friendship with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, who have played an integral role in the annual Round-Up. Indeed, the design inspirations for Pendleton Woolen Mills blankets originate on the Umatilla reservation. In 2001, Mort was honored as the grand marshall for the Round-Up's Westward Ho! Parade. The Umatilla and Nez Perce Indian tribes have also honored him with the Indian name "Caacaa Kuta," which means "just right doer of things." And  just 2 months ago, Mort was inducted into the Pendleton Round-Up Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to have had Mort Bishop as a friend. I join with many other Oregonians in extending our condolences to Mort's family. Mort is survived by four children, nine grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, and his brother- and sister-in-law. As long as there is a Pendleton Round-Up and as long as there is a Pendleton Woolen Mills, Mort Bishop, Jr., will always be remembered as a "just right doer of things."</paragraph>
