    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Justin Thurber was a deviant that liked to secretly sneak, slither around, and follow women who rebuffed him. He tracked them like one would track an animal for prey. He did not like being told no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the young women in a small Kansas college town of Arkansas City, Thurber's predatory actions were well  known. He was the town stalker, the town weirdo. Jodi Sanderholm was one of his victims. When Jodi disappeared, her college friends knew who was responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 5 of this year, Thurber had enough of being ignored by Jodi. He kidnapped her; he drove her to a remote, lonely, desolate area in the county. He raped her; he strangled her to death. He covered up his dastardly murder by hiding her body in the remoteness of the woods and he dumped her car in the lake. Jodi died, and the last person on Earth she saw was not her family, but the town stalker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, nearly 1.4 million people are stalked each year, and most of them women. Intimidating a woman by following her around and showing up outside her home, work, and school is not romantic, it is a perverted crime. Hopefully the good people of Kansas will put this stalker in the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
