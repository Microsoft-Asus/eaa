    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today on the floor of the House the Members had to address a number of crises that this Nation is facing. It is interesting that we face delay and, if you will, obstruction on many of the issues that the American people want us to be engaged in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hoping that the economic stimulus package will move as quickly as possible, and when it comes back in its final form from the Senate and conference, that we will be assured that the individuals who are disabled and on Social Security also get a rebate, and that we have the sense of the Congress language that a moratorium should be in place for all of those individuals subject to subprime loans or on the brink of foreclosure and losing their homes. We must forge a pathway for the financial  industry to begin to allow people to reconstruct their loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, we voted today to extend FISA. The bill that we passed out of the Judiciary Committee under JOHN CONYERS' leadership is a good bill. I voted reluctantly for the extension, but we must pass a bill that protects civil rights and protects the national security of America.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
