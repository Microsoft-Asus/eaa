    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, pending before this body June 5, 1941, Mr. Speaker, was a debate on the war in Europe. Everyone listened as Representative John Elliott of Mississippi delivered yet another unfortunate anti-Semitic diatribe. Not even the events of Hitler's rise to power stopped him. Not even knowing there were six Jewish Members of the House stopped him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he was done, New York Congressman Mike Edelstein jumped to his feet and responded to this diatribe of anti-Semitism and he said the following words: "I deplore the idea that men in this House attempt to use the Jews as their scapegoat. I say it is unfair and I say it is un-American. All men are created equal, regardless of race, creed or color, and whether a man be Jew or Gentile, he may think what he deems fit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those were the words of Mike Edelstein, June 5, 1941. He left this podium, went into the Speaker's Lobby and died of a heart attack, and I wanted to recognize this on the anniversary of his passing.</paragraph>
