    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of a dedicated law enforcement officer, Officer Bradley Alan Moody of the City of Richmond Police Department. For the past 8 years, Officer Moody worked tirelessly to provide the citizens of Richmond with safety and service. On October 4, 2008, Officer Moody was tragically injured in the line of duty, and passed away 3 days later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Moody, 29 years old, was deeply committed to the city of Richmond. Shortly before his accident, he had received a commendation for chasing down and arresting two suspects carrying concealed weapons in separate incidents in August 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A K-9 officer and a member of the Richmond Police Department SWAT team, Officer Moody was renowned for his extraordinary work ethic among fellow officers. He was also extremely personable; able to both fight crime and interact with youth in the community. Throughout his career, Officer Moody demonstrated a passion for law enforcement and commitment to helping others, qualities that enabled him to become a respected and model member of the Richmond Police Department. Officer Moody's colleagues  will always remember him for his professionalism and devotion to serving the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Moody was a loving husband, proud father, and devoted friend. He is survived by his wife, Susan, a former Richmond police dispatcher, and two young children. Officer Moody served the city of Richmond with honor and dignity, and his contributions to his community and the many lives he touched will serve as a shining example of his legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will always be grateful for Officer Moody's service and the valor that he displayed while serving and protecting the people of Richmond.</paragraph>
