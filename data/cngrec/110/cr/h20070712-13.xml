    <paragraph>Americans love to compete and to set records. In fact, people all over the world record their records in the Guinness Book of World Records. But there are some kinds of records called Darwin Awards for foolish behavior where people eliminate themselves by doing something unusual. One man took a pistol and decided to rob a gun store and got shot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats are not using a pistol, but they have been setting some records. They have just set one this year, that is, the largest tax increase  in the history of this country. It comes out to about $290-some-billion. But that means to the average household a $3,000 tax increase. What household can absorb a $3,000 tax increase in just 1 year alone?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, that is not the only record being set by the Democrats. They have doubled that record in terms of how much money they have spent, over $800 billion, which would come to $6,000 per family. American people would be better if we didn't set records like that.</paragraph>
