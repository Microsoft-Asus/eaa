  <narrative>(Mr. LOEBSACK asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to speak today in strong support of House Resolution 924, congratulating Iowa State University of Science and Technology for 150 years of leadership and service to the United States and the world as Iowa's land-grant university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State University is not in the Second District, but it is a very important place to me. The university serves thousands of students across Iowa, helping them prepare for the workforce and starting them on the path to success. Iowa State is my alma mater. I received a first-rate education at the university; and although I now represent the University of Iowa Hawkeyes, I am proud to be a Cyclone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State has many claims to fame. It was the first land-grant institution to be coeducational from its opening, with 16 women in its first class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Future suffragette Carrie Chapman Catt was an 1880 graduate. George Washington Carver was the first African American student, earning a bachelor's degree in 1894 and a master's degree in 1896 and was also the institution's first African American faculty member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State is also known for its cutting-edge agricultural research. Agriculture is a driving force in our State's economy, and the work the university does helps us remain competitive and strong. I am proud to say that most undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at Iowa State come from Iowa, and a large proportion of these students remain in Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, about 71 percent of College of Agriculture and Life Science graduates stay in Iowa for their first jobs. Young men and women graduate and gain employment on farms and agricultural services, in forestry, in fishing, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Iowa State University for 150 years of excellence, and I look forward to another 150 years of the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 924, congratulating Iowa State University of Science and Technology for 150 years of leadership and service to the United States and the world as Iowa's land-grant university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa Agriculture College and Model Farm, now Iowa State University, was officially established on March 22, 1858. As a land-grant institution, Iowa agriculture college focused on ideals that higher education should be accessible to all and that the university should teach liberal and practical subjects. These ideas are integral to the land-grant university policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even before Abraham Lincoln signed a law that gave birth to the land-grant universities, Iowa State was actively bringing knowledge to the people of  Iowa through farmers' short courses and farm demonstrations. The first official class, consisting of 24 men and two women, entered at Ames in 1869 and graduated in 1872.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State then was a leader and is now a leader in agriculture, engineering, extension, home economics, and created the Nation's first State veterinary medicine school in 1879. In 1959, the college was officially renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology. The focus on technology has led to many research patents and inventions, including the first binary computer, the round hay baler, and many, many more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today Iowa State University has approximately 27,000 students, some change from over 100 years ago. With world-class programs in agriculture, technology, science and art, the "U.S. News &amp; World Report" ranks Iowa State among the top 50 public national universities. Half of Iowa State University freshmen get an early boost in academic success by participating in Iowa State's highly touted Learning Communities Program. Additionally, Iowa State University is ranked 18th in the Nation for its study  or work abroad programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State University is a very special place that is full of history; but what truly makes it unique is a rare combination of campus beauty, the opportunity to be part of the land-grant experiment, and to create a progressive and inventive spirit that they call the Cyclone Experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations along with all my colleagues to the university president, Gregory Geoffroy, all of Iowa State University's faculty, its staff, certainly, its students and alumni, and wish them continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412209" topic="">
    <paragraph>First I want to thank the gentleman from New York for his wonderful words for Iowa State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to my friend and mentor, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 924, celebrating the 150th anniversary of Iowa State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my dear friend, Congressman Loebsack, for his leadership and yielding the time, and I also want to thank Congressman Braley and Congressman Latham for their leadership on this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State University has made noteworthy contributions to the State of Iowa, our Nation and the world since being established in 1958. Iowa State was the first co-ed land-grant institution providing opportunities for students regardless of gender, race, or social class. Iowa State is home to critical agriculture research, from the development of the hybrid seed corn in the 1920s to important work on the development of ethanol and to the development of modern livestock animal genetics and many  more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State continues to lead the Nation in research into biorenewable fuels and modern agriculture. In 2005 Iowa State's students finished third in the North American Solar Challenge, the world's longest solar car race. Iowa State has excelled in a number of other areas, from development of the electronic digital computer in the 1930s to research into refining reactor-grade uranium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The campus of Iowa State is also noteworthy. With over 600 public works of art, Iowa State was rated one of the 25 most beautiful campuses in "The Campus as a Work of Art." Iowa State has graduated a number of prominent contributors to our Nation, including, as mentioned, George Washington Carver, who went on to serve as the school's first African American faculty member, as well as suffragette Carrie Chapman Catt, who graduated in 1880.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, more than half my colleagues in the current Iowa delegation attended Iowa State, including Mr. Loebsack, who is the floor manager of the bill, BRUCE BRALEY, TOM LATHAM, and Senator TOM HARKIN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with the great institution that is Iowa State University and I am confident that Iowa State will continue to have great influence in Iowa and across our Nation. Again, congratulations to Iowa State University for 150 remarkable years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge support of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Iowa State University is one of the most respected land-grant universities in the Nation. Created by the Iowa General Assembly in 1858, the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm was designated the first land-grant college when Iowa became the first state to accept the terms of the Federal Morrill Act in 1864.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act allowed Iowa to sell Federal land to finance a new college open to all, regardless of wealth, race or sex; offering a practical education in engineering, agriculture, and military science as well as classical studies; and sharing research knowledge with all Iowans. Iowa State University officially opened in 1869 and was the first coeducational land-grant school. Today, we are proudly celebrating the 150th anniversary of Iowa State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State University has been a leader in science in technology throughout its long history. The world's first electronic digital computer was developed at Iowa State by math and physics professor John V. Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry, in the late 1930s. Their invention, the ABC computer, has been called the most important technological innovation of the 20th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The university is a leader in virtual reality research and its most advanced virtual reality theater, the C6, is the Nation's first six-sided theater that totally immerses the user in images and sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa State is one of the top three U.S. universities in the development of patentable biotechnology. Last February, the Iowa Board of Regents approved a $32 million budget and conceptual design for a new biorenewables research laboratory at Iowa State University. The laboratory is the first piece of a new biorenewables complex planned for the university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Biorenewables research is the future of ISU and the State of Iowa. I congratulate Iowa State University on 150 years, and wish them many more. Go Cyclones.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my almamater, Iowa State University, for 150 years of service to Iowa and the Nation. Iowa State University was founded on March 22, 1858, as the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm. The college was one of the first land grant institutions in the country and was founded in response to the state of Iowa's strong desire to provide higher education opportunities to farm families and the working class in Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to say that my alma mater has taken an active role in promoting social justice and racial equality throughout its 150 year history. Iowa State University was the first coeducational land grant university graduating 16 women in its first graduating class. George Washington Carver was the first African American to graduate from the college in 1880 and later served as a faculty member at Iowa State. Women suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt also graduated from Iowa State in 1880. Finally, Iowa  State is home to the only division one football stadium to be named for an African American. Jack Trice stadium is named for Iowa State football player Jack Trice. Trice died due to injuries suffered during an Iowa State football game in 1923.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the biggest technological advancements in the world of science were made at Iowa State University. In the late 1930's Professor John Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry invented the first electronic digital computer at Iowa State. In the 1920's hybrid seed corn was developed at Iowa State and in the 1930's Professor Orland Sweeny conducted pioneer work on ethanol production from corn. Finally, the school established the Nation's first engineering experiment station and domestic  economy experimental kitchen, and one of the first agricultural experiment stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to call Iowa State my alma mater and congratulate them for 150 years of academic excellence. I urge my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the Iowa Sate community for all they have done and will continue to do for Iowa and the nation</paragraph>
