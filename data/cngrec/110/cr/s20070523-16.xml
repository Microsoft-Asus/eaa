  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the White House has just announced the President has withdrawn the nomination of Michael Baroody to be the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I think this is a wise move on the part of the White House because of the perceived conflict of interest of Mr. Baroody--an employee of the National Association of Manufacturers being nominated to be the Chairman of the very regulatory agency that governs the regulation and the safety of the very products  of the industry from which he comes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be like, in my former life as the elected insurance commissioner, if in a State where the Governor appointed the insurance commissioner, a regulator, the Governor would pick an executive of an insurance company to regulate the very industry he came from as the insurance commissioner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, that happens with tremendous frequency in the 50 States, that they appoint the insurance commissioner, and they are usually there for less than a year. Then the revolving door turns again, and they go right back into the very industry from which they came and of which they had just been the regulator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Putting someone from the National Association of Manufacturers at the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is a similar kind of potential conflict of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will give you another example. My former colleague and friend in the House, Billy Tauzin--a distinguished public servant, Congressman formerly from Louisiana--now is the head of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. This would be like the White House appointing Billy Tauzin--the very head of an association in the industry--to regulate that industry by making him head of the Food and Drug Administration, the regulatory body that would regulate the pharmaceutical industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, I do not think the White House would even think of doing such a thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, a similar kind of conflict of interest arose. But a more serious note even arose than the potential conflict when it became apparent there was a severance package that had been created for Mr. Baroody while he was still in the employ of the National Association of Manufacturers that was for $150,000; and subsequently we learned of an additional amendment to that severance package, after it was announced he was nominated to be Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Baroody came in and we had a discussion about this issue. He had his own explanation. I do not take anything from that explanation. So, naturally, the next request that I made was that I think the Commerce Committee ought to see the documents of the $150,000 severance package and its amendments, its subsequent modification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Baroody said he would consider that request. Of course, the clock was ticking because there was going to be a hearing in front of the Commerce Committee tomorrow on his nomination. But, in the meantime, the White House has just announced it is having the President withdraw the nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will conclude by saying we have a saying down in the South in regard to avoiding a conflict of interest. It is like putting a fox in charge of the hen house, the very hen house with the hens you want to protect. It is an apparent conflict of interest. I think the White House was well served to withdraw the nomination.</paragraph>
