  <speaking speaker="400653" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Honorable Barbara Lee for introducing the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day resolution. I also thank the 396 Members who voted in support of this resolution in a true spirit of bipartisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I ask the question, why is it important to support National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness? Why? Because as of 2005, 188,000 African Americans were living with AIDS. Why? Because African Americans are 12 percent of the population and over 50 percent of the new cases diagnosed. Why is it important? Because for African Americans, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death. Why is it important, Madam Speaker? Because AIDS is the number one cause of death for African American women 25 to 34.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, Madam Speaker, notwithstanding the impending crisis, I am hopeful. I am hopeful that we will allocate more funds, more funds for medication, because this disease can be treated. More funds for counseling because this disease can be prevented. More funds for research because this disease can be cured. And, Madam Speaker, I believe that we must end AIDS because it has the potential to be our end.</paragraph>
