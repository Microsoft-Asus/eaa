  <narrative>NBC SHOWS BIAS -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4327]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week NBC News aired an interview with President Bush in which it removed key statements from the President's response to a question about diplomatic relations with Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some editing is to be expected, in this case NBC misrepresented the President's response so that it appeared he agreed with the premise of the question when, in fact, he explicitly disputed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The White House says NBC's "deceitful editing" was intended to perpetuate a "media-manufactured storyline" about Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people deserve to know the President's complete statements on major foreign policy issues. We rely on journalists to provide this information through fair and impartial reporting. The American people rightfully expect the media to give them all the facts, not just a slanted version.</paragraph>
