    <paragraph>Mr. President, I direct to the attention of all Senators that tomorrow afternoon Senators who have amendments to the ethics lobbying earmark reform legislation, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, be prepared to start offering them. We are going to work until we complete this legislation. It is my goal to complete the bill the following week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind Senators that Monday is the Dr. Martin Luther King holiday; therefore, of course there will be no votes on Monday. The first vote on Tuesday will be at 5:30 on that day, Tuesday; the 16th, I think, is the date. It is Tuesday, a week from tomorrow. I will indicate the reason I am not moving more quickly is I have had a number of Senators tell me they have events on Monday dealing with the commemoration of the Dr. King holiday and that they could not be here in time for work on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to work hard. We are going to finish the bill the following week. I advise Senators we are going to finish the bill the following week. Everyone should be aware that we will finish it. Even if we have to go past Friday at noon, we are going to finish this bill because we are going to move thereafter to minimum wage. Thereafter, it appears at this stage we are going to move to either the stem cell legislation and then the negotiating for lower prescription drug prices for Medicare.  I don't know if we are going to do stem cell first or the Medicare negotiation bill, but one of those will be the third matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot to do. Today the Senate voted to adopt a resolution honoring the late President Gerald Ford. Tomorrow we are beginning the ethics bill at 11, as under a previous order. Tomorrow will be a full day for debate and amendments to that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, the bulk of the bill is under the auspices of the Rules Committee. Senators Feinstein and Bennett will be ready to go tomorrow at 11. We also will see Senators Lieberman and Collins managing certain parts of that bill when the Senate Homeland Security Committee's jurisdiction is primary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask, Mr. President, that the morning hour be deemed to have expired tomorrow morning when we reconvene.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
