  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO ADA MAE GROETZINGER HAURY -- (Senate - September 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11006">S11006</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I seek to pay tribute to an outstanding educator. As the Senate takes up the appropriations bills--it soon will take up the bill on funding for education--it is appropriate to focus on the importance of education in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My brother, my two sisters, and I have been able to share in the American dream because of our educational opportunities. My father had no formal education. My mother only went to the eighth grade, when she had to leave work to help support her family where her father had died in his mid-40s of a heart attack. But because of their love for education and recognition of its importance, their children have benefited from great educational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our health is our No. 1 capital asset. Without good health, none of us can do anything. And our No. 2 capital asset is education. Without education, there are severe limitations. I say this in the context of paying tribute to Ada Mae Groetzinger Haury, the Russell High School debate coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She came to Russell in the fall of 1945, in her early 20s, having recently graduated from college herself. She brought a level of intensity to high school debating, which level of intensity was unparalleled in my educational experience. We had a class in debate at 9 o'clock in the morning. Then she would sit at 4 o'clock and have another round of debate, again at 5, again at 7, and again at 8 o'clock. And she would judge the debates. In retrospect, it seems surprising that somebody would have  done that. Each member of the debating team debated twice in 1 day, once in the class at 9 and once in the other lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The analytical process in working through the debate topics--one of which was national health insurance, another of which was lowering the voting age to 18--was great for high school students. Our high school coach, Ms. Groetzinger, emphasized a smooth delivery. If anybody faltered during the course of a 10-minute speech or a 5-minute rebuttal, that individual was likely to be rated fourth. She rated everybody on every day of the debates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was not only the first team which excelled, but it was the second team which also excelled. We went to one tournament at Salina High School, a town about 70 miles east of Russell, and the second team did better in the preliminary rounds than the first team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second team advanced to the semifinals, and the first team, which I was on, sat and watched the proceedings because they had done better than the first team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One year everybody on the debating team went through one tournament undefeated. So it was a very remarkable background in analysis, in organization, in extemporaneous speaking, and very good training for the practice of being a trial lawyer, very good training for being a Senator, very good training for the questioning which we do in the various committees where we serve.</paragraph>
