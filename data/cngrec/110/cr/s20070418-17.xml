    <paragraph>Madam President, if I could take another minute of the time of the distinguished Senator, we hope we can finish this bill tomorrow. That would be my desire. Tomorrow is Thursday. I am filing this tonight. The time ripens for voting on this Friday morning. But Friday morning occurs at 1 a.m. We have to finish this bill as soon as we can. I am alerting everyone, there could be a vote Friday morning at 1 a.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also suggest that I have been trying for some time now to do a bipartisan bill that has been worked on by many Senators. There are 50 cosponsors of this legislation, dealing with competitiveness. On our side it will be managed by Senator Bingaman. It is my understanding on the other side it will be managed by Senator Alexander. I hope we can have an agreement to move to that. I hope I do not have to file a motion to proceed to that piece of legislation. Remember, next week  we need to complete work to send to the President the supplemental appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, I want to alert everyone I think it is too bad. This bill that is before the body now, the Court Security bill, has been passed by the Senate on two separate occasions. We have filed cloture; cloture was invoked. I appreciate very much the minority allowing us to move to the bill. But this afternoon I had a meeting with Mr. Clark, head of the U.S. Marshals Service. This year, threats to Federal judges have gone up 17 percent. We have had vile things done to judges all over the  country, even in the State of Nevada, and we need to give Federal courts and local courts protection. We need to be a country that is ruled by the finest judicial system in the world, which we have now, and we cannot have bad people take away our court system--and violence can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can finish this bill in a reasonable time tomorrow. If not, tomorrow will be a long night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate very much my friend from Iowa allowing me to speak for a minute.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Iowa.</chair>
