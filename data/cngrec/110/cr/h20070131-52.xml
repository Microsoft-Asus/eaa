    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Colonel Brian D. Allgood, who passed away on January 27, 2007, in Baghdad, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Colonel Allgood died of injuries sustained when his helicopter crashed. Brian's wife and son reside in Heidelberg, Germany, and his parents, Gerald and Cleo Allgood, reside in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Allgood graduated from West Point in 1982 and from the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in 1986. After completing his residency, Colonel Allgood continued his military career as a doctor in the Army. He was not only a doctor but was a first-class soldier who parachuted into Panama as a battalion surgeon in the 75th Ranger Regiment during Operation Just Cause in 1989. After rising through the ranks, Brian became a full colonel in 2002 and served in top medical commands in Korea and  Germany before becoming the command surgeon of Multi-National Forces Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Allgood comes from a strong military family and followed in the footsteps of his father, who was a Army doctor and a Vietnam War veteran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Allgood was a remarkable soldier, an exceptional doctor and a devoted husband and father who served in the Army to keep this Nation free and sacrificed his life for our safety and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Colonel Brian D. Allgood for his service to our country, and I offer my deepest condolences to his family.</paragraph>
