    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the community of Tulare, SD. After 125 years, this progressive community will have a chance to reflect on its past and future, and I congratulate the people of Tulare for all they have accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tulare is located in northeast South Dakota, within Spink County on Highway 281. Originally plotted by Charles Prior in 1883, the town quickly grew as an important railroad supply station. There is some disagreement about the naming of Tulare, which tends to follow three different stories. The first story tells that when riding the train to Tulare, Mr. Prior encountered two men entertaining the passengers with tall tales. He was so amused by the time he reached his destination, he decided to  call the town site "Tulare" after the "two liars." The second story claims the town was named after the "Tulle" weed that grows in the swamps, and the third story names the city after a Native America chief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Tulare has come a long way from its days as a railroad supply center. The town now boasts a variety of businesses, including those in both the service and manufacturing sectors. Coupling with those parts of the economy are the rich natural resources including the plentiful pheasant population which further aids in the prosperity of this community. The town also continues their long tradition of high standards in education that began here with the first 4-year high school and continues  to thrive as the Hitchcock-Tulare School District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tulare has become a credit to Spink County and the State of South Dakota. The people of Tulare will celebrate their achievements June 20-22, 2008, with a basketball tournament, parade, car and quilt show, and street dance. I am proud to join with the community members of Tulare in celebrating the last 125 years and look forward to a promising future.</paragraph>
