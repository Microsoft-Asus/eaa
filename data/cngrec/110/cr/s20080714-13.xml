  <narrative>DHL SELLOUT -- (Senate - July 14, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6617">S6617</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this summer is turning out to be one of great anxiety and uncertainty for literally thousands of families in southwest Ohio. At this moment, the economic future of more than 8,000 people--8,000 workers and their families--in the Wilmington and surrounding communities hangs in the balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHL, the cargo carrier service, has threatened to shut down its Wilmington hub, a decision that, if successful, threatens both families and surrounding communities. In May, DHL's parent company, the German company Deutsche Post World Net, announced a proposed deal with UPS that would close the Ohio operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, the State of Ohio and the city of Wilmington, a community of 13,000 people, and surrounding counties--Highland County, Greene County, Clark County, and the area around it--proudly laid out the welcome mat for DHL, providing more than $400 million in incentives only 4 years ago. It was, we thought then, the beginning of a long friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wilmington Air Park is the largest employer in a six-county area of Ohio. Literally, in each of the six counties in the region, DHL is the single largest employer. Air Park employees were drawn from 45 counties, more than half of Ohio's 88 counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, Americans from across the country will gather around their television sets to enjoy baseball's All Star game in Yankee Stadium. The first pitch will be thrown by Cleveland's All Star pitcher Cliff Lee. During this midsummer classic, fans may notice emblazoned on the walls of Yankee Stadium and on game memorabilia the DHL logo, because DHL is the official carrier of major league baseball. More than 8,000 Ohio workers and their families have helped make DHL a major league player in the  North American express delivery business. Their families in the community have supported DHL, worked for DHL, helped build DHL, and State and local governments pitched in, as I said, with $400 million to build this company and help it thrive in southwest Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, the agreement with UPS and the agreement to shut down is not yet final, and so we fight. This morning, earlier today, Mayor David Raizk, Clinton County Commissioner Randy Riley, and I joined hundreds of DHL, ABX, and Air Star workers to fight for these jobs and this community. Together, I delivered to DHL's headquarters in Wilmington--at their headquarters just outside Wilmington, on the outskirts of Wilmington--I delivered more than 9,000 signatures on petitions to DHL headquarters,  petitions  that were denied by DHL management 2 weeks ago when employees and community members tried to deliver them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHL needs to hear from these families and they need to understand that good corporate citizenship means more than baseball advertisements and company sponsorships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHL workers and their families rightfully feel betrayed by the callous decision made by Deutsche Post.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This kind of betrayal does not just eliminate jobs. The community loses revenue, public schools take a hit, the police force, fire department--all take major hits. It is estimated that 10 percent of the Wilmington City school budget is derived from DHL's operations in Wilmington. Hospitals suffer. Clinton Memorial Hospital is a not-for-profit, and people connected with DHL account for a huge percent of their overall operations. They get $7 million in revenue just from DHL, ABX, and ASTAR, and  their overall budget is $100 million. They don't know how they will be able to continue operations if DHL closes its operations in Wilmington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some 15,000 children of those DHL workers at the Wilmington airpark--DHL, ASTAR, and ABX--who will lose their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I stood with the real All Stars, a couple of hundred workers and their families from southwest Ohio at DHL and at their union hall right across the street. In the last few months they have been sending me their stories. I would like to share some of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tara Pratz of Lebanon, a community a few miles from there in Warren County, told me she and her husband relocated to Ohio because they trusted DHL and the promises made to her and workers like her. Reading from her note, she said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deustch-Post is nothing more than a corporate terrorist destroying the very lives that built the company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kelly Morse of Blanchester also wrote me about moving to Ohio because of the loyalty she felt for DHL. She wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At first we did not want to move, but as a loyal employee I wanted to live close to my employer. DHL needs to be held accountable for the commitments they made to the people, workers, and community of southwest Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Vienna resident Beth Carpenter wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My husband is one of the many employees being laid off ..... with the economy the way it is, it is hard enough trying to keep food on the table, let alone to try to do it without a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sherry Barrett, also of New Vienna, wrote, simply:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all extremely terrified of what our future holds. .....We need all of you in our government to fight hard for us and Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it doesn't need to be this way. DHL has been a good corporate citizen. It can remain a good friend to the people of Ohio. Workers and family members and the community are ready to do whatever it takes--whatever it takes. This morning in Wilmington it was clear that this community sticks together when times are tough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
