    <paragraph>Madam President, the current newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits the coownership of a newspaper and a broadcast station in the same market. This rule is the only local ownership rule that has not been modified by the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, since the ownership rules went into place over 30 years ago. Despite massive innovation in the media marketplace, the advocates of <bill type="sj" number="28">S.J. Res. 28</bill>, the Dorgan resolution, want to preserve an archaic rule that is no longer  relevant or useful in today's media world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 18, 2007, the FCC issued an order to provide a modest relaxation of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership prohibition in the top 20 markets. To ensure that one company doesn't control the local media, the prohibition is only relaxed if there are eight independent television stations in the market. The rule change only applies to the acquisition of a television station not ranking in the top four in any market, which essentially excludes network affiliated stations. The FCC's order  further mandates that all proposed newspaper-broadcast combinations be reviewed by the Commission on a case-by-case basis with the opportunity for public comment. Simply put, the new FCC rule provides a modest relief in a limited number of markets and ensures that any changes are carefully scrutinized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 18 months of review and more than 150,000 filed comments, 10 empirical studies, and 6 field hearings, the FCC fully vetted its decision to relax the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule. It determined that the "harm" envisioned by cross-ownership is directly contradicted by simple facts. Currently, there are a number of newspaper-broadcast station ownership combinations that are exempt from the ban through grandfathers and waivers. These combinations have served the needs of the local  communities well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FCC also found that the ban on newspaper-broadcast combinations was established at a time when communications in any town consisted of a newspaper and, at best, a handful of local television and radio stations. The rule is antiquated in today's media world where there are multiple sources of news and viewpoints, such as the Internet, satellite radio, blogs, cable, and other forms of communication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, upholding the ban would also largely ignore the dire financial condition of the newspaper industry. Due to the multiple news and information outlets available to consumers, local newspapers are finding it harder to make a profit. What is at stake here is the long-term health of newspapers and their ability to provide the kind of journalism that has served our democratic society well for more than 200 years. Permitting cross-ownership with broadcast stations allows greater financial efficiency  in the market, allowing some newspapers to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of these reasons, I will not support the Dorgan resolution. The FCC's narrow rule will not lead to mass consolidation, and I would encourage my colleagues to consider the ramifications of reversing the FCC's order.</paragraph>
