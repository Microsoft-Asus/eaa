  <narrative>"PRESIDENT NO" ATTEMPTS TO USE VETO PEN AS DISTRACTION FROM HIS FISCAL MANAGEMENT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13215]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. HODES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the last couple of weeks, President Bush has turned into President Veto, saying "no" to a bill that would provide 10 million children access to health care and then saying "no" last week to a bill that would protect the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans from the devastating impact of flooding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 6 years of signing any bill that came to his desk and disregarding the impact legislation would have on our Nation's fiscal well-being, President Bush is now trying to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who, exactly, is the President trying to fool? He turned a $5.6 trillion surplus that he inherited from President Clinton into a $3 trillion deficit. That's a reversal of fortune of $8 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Democrats took control of Congress, we vowed to restore fiscal sanity, and we began by restoring sensible pay-as-you-go rules. Every bill that we have brought to this floor has complied with these rules, but the President continues to imply that he is more fiscally responsible than this new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people should not and will not be fooled by this change in rhetoric.</paragraph>
