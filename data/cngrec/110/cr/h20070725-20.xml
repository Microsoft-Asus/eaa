    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pride to welcome home the Iowa Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry. The Ironman Battalion returns to Iowa today after a 22-month deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving in al-Anbar province, the Ironman Battalion provided transportation security for more than one-third of the fuel used by coalition forces in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with a heavy heart that I note that the 133rd Infantry lost two soldiers. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to their families and loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that the 133rd has returned home, we must honor their service by providing for their health care and productive futures. Our commitment to these citizens must extend throughout their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the Second District of Iowa, I thank the soldiers of the 133rd Infantry for their service. It is with great pride and gratitude that we welcome them home today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
