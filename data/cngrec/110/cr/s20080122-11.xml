    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is good to be back in the Senate. The past 4 1/2  weeks have been very pleasurable for me. Since I have been the Democratic leader--which has now been for 3 years--it was the longest period of time I have been able to spend at home, and it was a great experience for me. Every day I was able to spend it in my home in Searchlight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Searchlight, even though it is 60 miles from Las Vegas, is much different in temperature. It rains twice as much--not a lot but 8 inches a year compared to 4 inches in Las Vegas--but it is much colder. It is 3,600 feet high. It has had a number of days in the recent past where the temperature has been 8 degrees. That is the lowest it has ever been, but it has hit that low degree on a number of occasions. This trip home, the lowest it got was 18 degrees, but that was on the same occasion when  we had 40-mile-an-hour winds, so it was bitter cold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that is one reason I so love Searchlight. The air is pristine and clean and pure. It is refreshing for me to be able to go home. Out my window, on one side of the house, I have set up two little ceramic water dishes, and water comes on there four times a day. Those little animals have it made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though it is wintertime, the quail still come and need a drink of water now and then. If you are lucky, you see a coyote--which I saw on a couple of occasions. As wily and as reclusive as they are, you still see them out wandering around--and all kinds of different birds of different hues and colors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It may not be very exciting to most people, but for me, one of the exciting events of my trip home was the opportunity to see an animal you rarely see. My wife and I were working in a little study I have there, and we heard three distinct knocks. We didn't know what it was. We got up and looked out the front door--nothing there; we looked out the back--nothing there. I went back to work and a minute or two later my wife says: Get down here. Hurry. So we go to these windows, some picture windows,  two large rectangular windows that look out on the area where the ceramic dishes are, and there was a bobcat. For those of us who live in the desert, seeing a bobcat is really almost akin to seeing the Abominable Snowman. Rarely does anyone see a bobcat. They do most of their hunting at night. They are very secretive in everything they do. But this afternoon, this bobcat was there drinking water, very thirsty. I had never seen a bobcat before. Having been born there, raised there, I had never seen a bobcat before. This little animal finished its water, was walking around, saw me in the window and, boy, that little animal hit that window. It was</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate is going to be forever different for me now. For more than a quarter of a century, part of my workplace has evolved around one of the Senate employees: Martin Paone. First, as I was a new Senator, he was always here to help me feel more comfortable and answer, I am sure as we look back, dumb questions we all ask as new Senators, but he was always a gentleman, always willing to give us the information. For the 9 years I have been involved as Democratic leader, he has been available.  During the 6 years I spent on the floor as Senator Daschle's assistant and whip, Marty was always there giving me guidance and advice. He was always so very helpful. It is important to have someone who understands these complicated rules we have in the Senate. He has been a terrific coworker and a good friend and I am going to miss him tremendously. As I have said, the Senate will never be the same with Marty not being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is bittersweet news that Marty is going to be leaving--retiring. He has served the Senate for 30 years. His story is a remarkable success story. He began his career in the House Post Office to help pay his way through graduate school at Georgetown. Later he moved to the Senate Parking Office before joining the Democratic cloakroom in 1979. With his tremendous intellect and vast knowledge of procedure, it was no surprise that he moved up the ranks to become Secretary for the minority in  1995. It is no exaggeration to say that every single Democrat and a number of Republicans rely upon Marty's expert advice. That has ended. I have been, as I have indicated, one of those who has depended on his expertise. Nothing has happened on the Senate floor, no legislation was considered, no parliamentary procedure enacted without his influence. Countless staff have come and gone over the years, but he has been a constant, steady presence. I am grateful</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we are sad to say goodbye to Marty, I am pleased to announce we have chosen Lula Davis as our new Democratic Secretary. She is a long-time veteran of this Chamber. Lula has had more than 25 years of Senate service, which began in the office of the legendary Russell Long of Louisiana. Since 1993, she has been a member of the Democratic floor staff. In 1997, she was elected as the first woman ever to serve as Assistant Democratic Secretary. Much like Marty, Lula has risen to become indispensable  for all of us. She has big shoes to fill, but I can't think of a more capable person to take on this crucial role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Replacing Lula as Assistant Democratic Secretary will be Tim Mitchell. Tim is quiet, always available, so important to me. I appreciate his attention to me on so many different occasions. He has served as floor assistant to the Democratic leader, where he has become a leading expert on floor procedure and legislative process. With 16 years of Hill experience and as a policy adviser for the Democratic Policy Committee, research director for Senator Daschle, and a legislative assistant to the Senate  Banking Committee, Tim could not be better prepared for some of these new responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am pleased to announce that Jacques Purvis, a member of our floor staff, will take on Tim's role as floor assistant. A Howard University fellow, Jacques began his career in my personal office. He is a wonderful, fine young man. He has shown enormous skill and has a bright future ahead of him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a moment?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to extend my appreciation for the service Marty has given your conference. I have found him invariably to be a straight shooter and somebody we could work with to try to make the Senate function. I think he and Dave have enjoyed a good working relationship. I, too, want to wish him well and thank him for his many years in the Senate and congratulate Lula on her appointment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to join in this chorus. Prior to my election to the House of Representatives, I served as parliamentarian of the Illinois State Senate for 14 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a very important role in that body, as Marty's role has been here. You don't spend much time before a microphone, but you spend a lot of time preparing the Members to say the right things before the microphone, and Marty has done that I think in the best possible tradition of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time and again, Members on our side of the aisle, and I believe on the other side as well, knew they could trust his word, trust his judgment, that he understood this institution, not just the rules but the history and the tradition. He served this institution well, as his wife has, and I wish him the very best in his new endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also happy to hear Lula Davis is going to replace Marty in his position. She has a tough act to follow, as has been said, but she is an extraordinary woman, who has served this Senate well for 25 years, and I am certain she will continue on in this fine tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield back to the majority leader.</paragraph>
