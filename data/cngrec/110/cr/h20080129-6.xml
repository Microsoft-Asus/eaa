  <narrative>THE TIME FOR EARMARK REFORM HAS ARRIVED -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H482]</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of January 4, 2007, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence) is recognized during morning-hour debate for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the American people are tired of spending-as-usual here in Washington, DC, especially when it comes to earmarking. Now, earmarking, for the uninitiated, is a process in Congress which has expanded greatly over the last 15 years under Republican control of Congress and, as we saw last year, under Democrat control of Congress. It is where Members of Congress oftentimes, for perfectly meritorious and honorable reasons, request specific projects for their  districts. But the American people know that something has gone wrong with the Federal budget process system, and the time for earmark reform has arrived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past weekend I'm pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, that House Republicans gathered in West Virginia and came together around a bipartisan challenge. We called on Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to join us in a timeout on earmarking in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans united behind a challenge for an earmark moratorium and the establishment of a new select committee that would engage in the kind of thoughtful analysis and hearings where we could truly change the way we spend the people's money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you are flying an airplane and the gauges start to tell you something is wrong with the engines, the first thing you do, Mr. Speaker, is put the airplane on the ground. Then you get under the hood and you figure out what is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I have to tell you that the explosion of earmarks under Republican control in the past years and the inclusion of hundreds of unexamined earmarks in last year's omnibus bill, dropped in at the last minute under the color of darkness, are evidence that the gauge lights are going off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to call a timeout, have a moratorium on earmark spending here in the Congress while we can come together, men and women, Republicans and Democrats, and figure out how we restore public confidence in the way we spend the people's money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By challenging Speaker Pelosi and the House majority to join us in ending earmarks as usual in Washington, DC, House Republicans have thrown down the gauntlet of reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I believe that while I still think our side should embrace an immediate moratorium on earmarks and lead by example, I applaud my colleagues for finding that common ground among Republicans wherein we can challenge, in a spirit of bipartisanship, our colleagues to join us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I still maintain nothing short of a full moratorium followed by public hearings and reform will be sufficient to restore public confidence in congressional appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as those debates have gone on, it is amazing to me, Mr. Speaker, to look at the morning headlines here in Washington, DC. It shows you the difference between the Muncie Star Press and newspapers out here. Earmarks are page 1, the focus on the "President's sudden severity is drawing bipartisan criticism." Roll Call says, "Earmarks Still Roil GOP," and the Politico, not to be outdone, repeats the exact same headline: "Earmark Debate Roils GOP Ranks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only in Washington, DC, where one party engages in a vigorous debate about how we restore public confidence in the Federal budget process that the focus then is on the debate of the party that wants to bring about change because the sound of silence from the Democrat majority is deafening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, while Republicans are having a vigorous debate, and I'm still one of the people that believes that our party should even go farther, that we should embrace a 1-year moratorium, I have advocated that among my colleagues and will continue to. But nevertheless, it is remarkable to me that the Washington press corps is more interested in discussions among Republicans who  have arrived at a consensus challenging the governing majority to join us in an  earmark moratorium than they are interested in the response of the majority who hold the reins of power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mean, headlines attest to a vigorous debate among the minority and dead silence among the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I must tell you, it has to be frustrating, Mr. Speaker, to millions of Americans who long for a Congress that will put integrity and the restoration of public confidence in the Federal budget above partisan differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to my colleagues on the other side, what is your response to our challenge for an immediate moratorium on all earmark spending? What will Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats decide at their conference retreat this week?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is as our challenge sits now on the table and is met with stark silence from the Democrats, that as your party meets, Mr. Speaker, as you consider how we can restore public confidence, that Democrats will join Republicans in an immediate earmark moratorium so we can put our fiscal house in order and restore public confidence.</paragraph>
