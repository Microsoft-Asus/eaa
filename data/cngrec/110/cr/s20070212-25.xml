    <paragraph>Mr. President, from April 28-30, 2007, more than 1,200 students from across the country will visit Washington, DC, to take part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, an important program developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by the Center for Civics Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to announce that the State of New Mexico will be represented by a class from Highland High School from Albuquerque at this prestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Washington, the students will participate in a 3-day academic  competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they "testify" before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they evaluate and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Independent studies show that students in the We the People program display a greater political tolerance and  commitment to the principles and values of the Constitution and Bill of Rights than do students using traditional textbooks and approaches. With many reports and surveys indicating the lack of civic knowledge and civic participation, I am pleased to support such a valuable program that is producing an enlightened and engaged citizenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The names of these outstanding students from Highland High School are:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aaron A, Adams, Allison J. Anglin, Richard S. Baca, Laura E. Baldwin, Kristy R. Calderon, Daniel Chavez, Danielle N. Easley, Heather L. Goldberg, Gabriel J. Hogan, Peyton K. Holloway, Martha A. Muna, Denise H. Ortiz, Milagro Padilla, Catherine U. Pham, Long Pham, Mark Ridder, Evan D. Root, Whitney A. Sousa, and Ruby R. Watkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to commend the teachers of the class, Bob Coffey and Steve Seth, who are responsible for preparing these young contestants for the national finals. Also worthy of special recognition is Dora Marroquin, the State coordinator, and Patricia Carpeneter, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People program in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish these students much success as they prepare to compete at the We the People national finals and applaud their great achievement.</paragraph>
