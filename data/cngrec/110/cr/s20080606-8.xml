  <narrative>CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION -- (Senate - June 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5350">S5350</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to address an environmental issue, an economic issue, and a moral issue. Future generations will look back on global warming as the defining issue of our time. Our children, their children, and their children will look back on this issue and judge us on how we confronted it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we treat global warming politically, as so many of the other side of the aisle did today, if we abdicate our responsibility, if we ignore reality, if we twiddle our thumbs as the destructive effects of global warming intensify, we will lose our chance to shape the future because, simply put, we will be squandering it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Senator Boxer, the chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, a tireless advocate for clean air, safe drinking water, and healthy families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was not an easy vote. This entire week I have listened to the speeches on the Senate floor, and I have listened to my colleagues speak eloquently on the need for global climate change legislation. I fully agree with the environmental goals of this bill--mandatory caps, the science-based timeline. This, as I said, is the moral question of our generation. I have the utmost respect for my colleagues who have worked so long and so hard to craft this historic legislation and for environmental  advocates in Ohio and across the country. I am 100 percent committed to passing a robust, mandatory cap-and-trade policy. However, while we have been debating climate policy, Ohioans have been getting bad news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been a particularly tough week for my State. In the last 7 days, Ohioans learned that our State may soon lose another 10,000 jobs. Those are not just jobs. They are the building blocks, the foundation for individual achievement, family security, and community survivability. They are about health care, they are about opportunity, they are about sending kids to college, they are about admission to the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that foundation is crumbling--10,000 good-paying jobs in 1 week. Since 2001, Ohio has lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have, to be sure, a moral obligation to our planet. For me, that obligation stems from Scripture which makes each of us a steward of our planet, of this Earth. We also have an opportunity and obligation to Ohioans and  to all Americans. We have the opportunity and the obligation to write global warming policy that is sustainable, equitable, beneficial, both domestically and globally, both environmentally and economically. We can do that. We can write  a bill to do that. We can write a law to do that or we can settle for a work that I believe is still in progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot settle and could not settle a moment ago in my vote for this legislation because it needlessly may hurt my State because it fails to protect against what could be a policy that exports emissions rather than eliminating emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submitted five amendments to this bill that were designed to produce a final bill that would combat global warming without undermining American families, without  hurting families from Galion to Gallipolis, from Cincinnati to Ashtabula. Unfortunately, after today's cloture vote, there was no opportunity to debate and vote on those amendments. Given the chance, I would have fought to redistribute the financial burden imposed by this bill so Ohio would receive a fair share, rather than the short end of the stick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would have fought to provide sufficient transition assistance for energy-intensive manufacturing so our Nation does not lose those crucial national-security oriented, in many cases, crucial jobs. I would have fought to ensure domestic manufacturers a level playing field with companies from countries without global warming requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A plant shuts down in Steubenville or Lima, OH, a plant that has followed Ohio and national environmental law over the years, and moves to China. We lose our jobs, and emissions get even greater because the Chinese do not have the environmental laws we do. That is part of the problem with U.S. trade policy. That is another time for another speech and another day. But if we don't take this right step to ensure domestic manufacturers a level playing field with companies from countries without global  warming requirements, we might as well throw a going-away party for the steel industry, the cement industry, the glass industry, aluminum industry, the chemical industry, for foundry after foundry after foundry in Ravenna, Chillicothe, Mansfield, and Marion. We might as well</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would have fought for greater capital investment in emerging green businesses and manufacturing. We need to go green to achieve our goals. We need to rebuild our manufacturing sector to remain a self-sufficient nation and the strongest economy on the planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can pass legislation that can be a jobs legislation, energy legislation, environmental legislation if we do the right thing and encourage our companies and our investors to build solar panels and solar cells, to build fuel cells, to build wind turbines, to move forward on all the kinds of biomass energy production that we know how to do in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why wouldn't we invest in the research, infrastructure, job training, and the commercialization needed to secure our independence from foreign oil, to fight global warming, to revitalize our economy? Mr. President, why wouldn't we?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would have fought for resources to help coal communities diversify their economies. If we ignore these communities, we breed poverty. Go with me to southeast Ohio and look at the number of people who are lining up in food pantries, lining up for food to get through the week, to get through the month, to get through the winter and now the spring, as most people in those families hold jobs, often full time, often part time. They don't pay enough because of what has happened to coal miners and  what has happened to industry in southeast Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, in moral terms and practical terms, cannot let that happen. If we ignore these communities, as I said, we breed more poverty. That is not a prediction, that is a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was not given the opportunity to offer my amendments. I will have the opportunity to push for legislation that capitalizes on our Nation's strengths, that leaves a legacy of which we can be proud for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do it, we must do it, and with Senator Boxer's leadership, we will do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
