    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my deepest concern for the situation that is worsening in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>March 19 of this year will mark the fifth year of war, and still Vice President Cheney states that the Democratic strategy toward Iraq validates al Qaeda's agenda. This comment really means that anyone that disagrees with him gets accused of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrorists instill fear in their enemies, and it is this fear that generates self-defeating behavior. It is this fear that led the American people to believe that war was a validated solution, and still try to link it to September 11. It is this fear that has cost the United States billions of dollars on Iraq reconstruction plans, while neglecting our own system.</paragraph>
