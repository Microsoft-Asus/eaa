    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral in Reno.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Construction on Saint Thomas Aquinas began in 1906, after Reno's sole Catholic church was destroyed by fire. Father Thomas Tubman led the effort to build a new church for Reno Catholics. He planned to construct a larger, more centrally located church, explaining that "The time has come for making the structures in Reno attractive as well as useful. The Cathedral will be one of the finest buildings in the State."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 21, 1908, Saint Thomas Aquinas opened its doors to parishioners with a remarkable dedication ceremony. Over 3,000 people waited outside the new church long before the ceremony was set to begin. At 10:30, dozens of priests and bishops, 120 Knights of Columbus, 2 bands and hundreds of parishioners were led by the chief of police and 16 patrolmen in a march from the convent of the Sisters of Mary to Saint Thomas Aquinas Church. Upon arriving, the Knights of Columbus encircled the new church  as Bishop Grace blessed the buildings exterior. A high mass was then celebrated with the church filled to capacity. About one hundred worshipers were unable to enter, and instead waited outside the building, listening to the beautiful music from the choir and organist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To celebrate its centennial anniversary, Reno Catholics reenacted this special ceremony last month. They joined in procession once again and marched together to the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral, where a celebratory mass was held. As they marched, they rejoiced in 100 years of memories at their place of worship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral prominently stands in the heart of downtown Reno and will forever remain in the hearts of Catholics who have worshiped here in the last 100 years. I am pleased to honor Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral today. I know that it will continue to serve Nevadans as an outstanding religious institution for another 100 years.</paragraph>
