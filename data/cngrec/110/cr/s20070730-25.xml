    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of two courageous firefighters, captain Matt Burton of Concord, CA and fire engineer Scott Desmond of Brentwood, CA. Captain Burton and Fire Engineer Desmond were heroes who died in the line of duty in San Pablo, CA on July 21, 2007. Captain Burton was 34 and Fire Engineer Desmond was 37.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both men were dedicated firefighters who served in the Contra Costa County Fire Department for more than 10 years. They were killed while battling a residential fire in a neighborhood outside of San Pablo. The two residents of the home, Delbert and Gayle Moore, were also killed in the blaze.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Burton and Fire Engineer Desmond are remembered by friends and colleagues as cheerful and full of life as well as seriously dedicated to their profession. The men served the community with enthusiasm and a commitment to protecting the residents of Contra Costa County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Matt Burton and Fire Engineer Scott Desmond risked their lives every day to make Contra Costa County safer. We will always be grateful for their brave service to their community and the State of California. Our hearts go out to their families, friends, and colleagues who struggle with their loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Burton is survived by his wife, Chantel, and his two children, Megan and Joshua Matthew. Fire Engineer Desmond is survived by his wife Carolyn and his 17-month-old son Tyler.</paragraph>
