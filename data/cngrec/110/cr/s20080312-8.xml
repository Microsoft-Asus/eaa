  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the only thing we haven't heard about the Republicans' plan to take care of the world is tort reform. That is usually part of the mantra. We have a situation where everything that should be going up is going down. We have an economy that is spiraling down. We have a housing market that is in crisis. We have gas prices that are predicted, by early summer, to be an average of over $4 a gallon. We have a war that is now starting its sixth year, and it is costing us $420  million a day. We have an economy that has gone from good to terrible. And we have a budget that has been put together with a tremendous soft touch. What does that mean? It means we are recognizing the problems we have in our economy, and we want to return to those days where we were paying down the national debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't pie in the sky. We have actually done it. This is a blueprint for how we need to proceed with our economy. I commend and applaud Senator Conrad for putting this budget together. There is nothing in this budget that talks about increasing taxes. In fact, what this budget does is decrease taxes for the middle class. In fact, that is what the Baucus amendment which is now pending is all about.</paragraph>
