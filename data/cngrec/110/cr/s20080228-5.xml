  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1323">S1323</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following my remarks and those of Senator McConnell, there will be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, with the majority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the final half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="2634">S. 2634</bill>, a bill to require a report setting forth the global strategy of the United States to combat and defeat al-Qaida and its affiliates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, procedurally, we are in a situation where we have asked to be able to legislate on a piece of legislation dealing with the President and those in his Cabinet sending to us reports on what is happening in the global war on terror. What has happened is what has happened now for more than a year, where the minority is not allowing us to go to that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a situation where we want to move to a piece of legislation. Procedurally, there has been in the Senate for many decades a provision that if we want to move to a piece of legislation and someone objects, the only thing we can do is file cloture on it. We did that. Cloture has been invoked. But now we are leading up to 30 hours. We had 30 hours on the original matter calling for a timeline for changing the course of the war in Iraq, and that was 30 hours we used. Now we are going to do  it on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is really too bad we are wasting time rather than getting to the legislation, but that is the way it is. And we, as a very slim majority, have come to accept that.</paragraph>
