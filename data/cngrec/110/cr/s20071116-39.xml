    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Jerry Parks of Georgetown, KY, for being recognized on USA Today's 2007 All-USA Teacher Team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 10 years USA Today has selected K-12 teachers nationwide for the All-USA Teacher Team. This year the nominees were judged on how well they recognize and respond to the needs of their students as well as the effectiveness of their teaching methods. Each team member demonstrates dedication and enthusiasm for educating the youth and future of this great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Parks, a seventh-grade social studies teacher at Georgetown Middle School, was recognized in the top 8 of 20 teachers on this national team. His creative hands-on teaching techniques produce students who value education and are eager to learn more. Mr. Parks also holds a doctorate in theology and has had several teacher guides published. Because of his commitment to education, Mr. Parks established student scholarships with the profits from these publications. His passion for teaching serves  as an inspiration to his peers and to teachers everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Parks for his remarkable achievement and his devotion to educating young minds. Our Nation can look forward to a brighter future because of individuals like Jerry Parks.</paragraph>
