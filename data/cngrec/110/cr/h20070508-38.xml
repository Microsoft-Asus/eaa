  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, President Bush declared that major combat operations in Iraq were over. To that point, we had lost 139 soldiers. Over the last 4 years, due to the administration's incompetence and lack of planning, thousands more U.S. troops have been killed and wounded, hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money has been spent, and now Iraq is consumed by a civil war that the President is asking our troops to referee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was way too soon for the President to declare mission accomplished, but 4 years later, the President seems content to tell our soldiers that their mission is not going to be accomplished any time soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By vetoing the Iraq supplemental last week, the President ignored the voices of the American people, his own military generals and this Congress. He can no longer afford to be that stubborn. The President must work with the Congress to come up with an agreement on how to move forward. He can't believe that this Congress is going to roll over and rubber-stamp his failed policies like past Republican Congresses have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats refuse to allow the status quo to continue. It is time we accomplish our mission in Iraq.</paragraph>
