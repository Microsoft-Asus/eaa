    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have lost Paulette Marie McFarland, 58, who was a trailblazer, an innovator in early childhood development, dying of pancreatic cancer on Tuesday, October 23, 2007, at her home in Chatsworth, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was born Paulette Marie Mahan in Bluefield, West Virginia, on August 12, 1949. She received her bachelor's in early childhood education from Hampton University in Newport News, Virginia, and her master's in education from Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paulette taught in the Los Angeles Unified School System for 30 years and spent the majority of her tenure at Van Nuys Elementary. She received many accolades during her career, which included Teacher of the Year for her school region. Paulette served as a Master Teacher for student teachers for Cal State University, Northridge and University of California, Los Angeles. She participated in the Bilingual Teacher Classroom Program and reviewed the latest research in education  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H14451]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She always admired educators and their ability to create challenging and novel ways to encourage students in learning. As a bilingual teacher, she strove to make education an exciting, joyful, and motivational tool. She was one who is able to motivate and challenge students in a positive and stimulating manner where students are encouraged to reach their potential and value their own self-worth. She was that person. Most importantly, she was an outstanding teacher, and she was one who loved and  enjoyed teaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paulette believed some of the major challenges today are low achievers, child and drug abuse, gangs, and development learning disabilities. And she promoted the importance of the individual increase in parental involvement providing parent education, smaller classes, and tutoring programs as possible solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paulette was not only committed to her students and her family, but the community at large. For many years, she served on the planning committee for the NAACP Image Awards. She was an active fund-raiser for the Chrysalis Homeless Center, the United Negro College Fund, and other charitable organizations. She participated in the Literacy Campaign for the American Broadcasting Company, and volunteered in food and clothing drives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 2 years, Paulette served as scholarship chairperson for the San Diego African American Alumni Association, and with her husband, Roland, served as president for 4 years. She secured funding for more than 100 students, making it possible for them to pursue a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 4, 1982, Paulette married Roland McFarland, vice president for broadcast standards and practices at Fox Broadcasting Company, at Hollywood Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her memory lives on through her beloved husband, his children, Curtis McFarland and Roslyn Daniels; mother, Odessa Mahan; father, David Mahan; sisters Beverly Cummings and Margo Mahan; brother, Garner Mahan, and many cherished grandchildren, family, and a host of friends. May she, indeed, rest in peace.</paragraph>
