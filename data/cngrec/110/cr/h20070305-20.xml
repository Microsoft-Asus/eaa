    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="376">H.R. 376</bill>) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility of including the battlefields and related sites of the First and Second Battles of Newtonia, Missouri, during the Civil War as part of Wilson's Creek National Battlefield or designating the battlefields and related sites as a separate unit of the National Park System, and for other purposes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="376">H.R. 376</bill>, introduced by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt). This legislation would direct the National Park Service to conduct a study to determine how best to protect the sites related to the First and Second Battles of Newtonia, Missouri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two Civil War battles were waged near Newtonia which lies in Newton County, Missouri. The first, on September 30, 1862, involved 4,000 Confederate troops and 6,500 Union soldiers, and it is believed to be the only Civil War battle in which full American Indian units fought on both sides of the conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Second Battle of Newtonia occurred on October 28, 1864, and involved 1,500 Union cavalry engaging a Confederate Army returning from the unsuccessful Missouri and Kansas Campaign of Confederate General Sterling Price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and congratulate my colleague, Mr. Blunt, for this bill. A hearing was held on a nearly identical measure last Congress, and that bill eventually passed the House. We strongly support <bill type="h" number="376">H.R. 376</bill> and urge its adoption by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="376">H.R. 376</bill> introduced by the distinguished minority whip, Representative ROY BLUNT of Missouri. It would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to determine the suitability of designating the First and Second Battles of Newtonia, Missouri, as a part of Wilson's Creek National Battlefield or as a separate unit of the National Park System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this bill. I commend the leadership and persistence of Mr. Blunt on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wish to, at this time, yield to the sponsor of the bill, the minority whip, such time as he may consume, Mr. Blunt of Missouri.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and thank the subcommittee chairman and the committee for bringing this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language we are discussing today is designed to authorize a study by the National Park Service to determine the feasibility of creating a new Civil War battlefield at Newtonia, Missouri, or bringing those battlefield lands under the management of the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield near Springfield and also near the Newtonia battlefield site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure is a necessary first step to determine if this battlefield, as I believe it will, fits the criteria necessary for being preserved as part of the National Park System. I believe the study will find that the two Civil War battles at Newtonia, like the Manassas Battlefield south of where we are now, hold a unique place in American history and are worthy of protection in the National Park Service system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two important battles were fought at Newtonia during the Civil War, one in 1862, where large numbers of American Indian troops on the Confederate side and the Union side, actually fought each other in battle. It was the largest of the rare engagements where native Americans fought on both sides in the Civil War. My understanding is that this is the place where those troops actually fought each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years later, in 1864, the last battle of the Civil War west of the Mississippi was fought at Newtonia as Confederate forces withdrew from Missouri after their defeat at Westport. Tennessee, Missouri and Virginia had the most battles in the Civil War, and this was the final battle in our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has really been strongly supported by the local community, as has the idea of preserving this battlefield. The Newtonia Battlefields Protection Association has spearheaded preservation efforts at Newtonia. In 2002, the association acquired 11 acres of the battlefield, along with the Ritchey Mansion, which is on the National Register of Historic Places for around $300,000. A year later, I delivered a ceremonial check for about half of that from the American Battlefield Protection  Program to reimburse the local group that had put this association together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Park Service rated the 1864 battlefield as a Priority I for preservation and the 1862 site as a Priority II. These sites are largely similar. They overlap in some places, but they are right next to each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A review by the National Park Service found the 1964 battlefield faced a greater threat from development. The not-for-profit Newtonia Battlefields Protection Association was formed in 1994 to work on funding to preserve the battlefields. In addition, the National Park Service has provided archaeological and historical surveys and assessments of the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this study will answer the questions that need to be answered before any further steps are taken. I am grateful to the committee for bringing this legislation to the floor today. If this study is agreed to by both bodies, it might even be funded in this year's appropriation process.</paragraph>
