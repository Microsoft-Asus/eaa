  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 341--CONCERNING THE RECENT FOREST FIRES IN GREECE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution with my friend and colleague Senator MENENDEZ concerning the devastating series of forest fires which ravaged much of Greece, especially in the Peloponnese, this past summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning in June, over 3,000 forest fires raged across the cradle of Democracy. Tragically, 9 people were killed in blazes in June and July, and 68 people lost their lives in the especially destructive fires between August 24 and September 4. The Greek economy ministry initially estimated that the fires caused 1.6 billion euros, or $2.2 billion of damage. Subsequent assessments have placed that figure as high as $5.4 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that, more than offering its sympathy, the U.S. has also offered its help to the brave people and government of Greece. According to the State Department, the U.S. Government has thus far contributed nearly $2 million in aid to Greece in response to the fires. The bulk of this aid was provided in a "wildfire assistance package" consisting of the deployment of a technical assistance team which arrived in Greece on September 1 representing the disciplines of: fire management, fire  investigation, emergency management systems, burn area emergency rehabilitation, and ecosystem and watershed restoration. Additionally, the U.S. Government provided 3,000 complete fire suits for the national fire brigade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans have also stepped up to give privately to the victims of these terrible fires as well. Charities organized by Greek-American organizations and the Orthodox Church in the U.S. have already raised millions to aid the people and government of Greece in rebuilding and mitigating the economic loss resulting from the fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is essential for the Senate to both recognize and pledge its support for  these efforts, as the connection between the U.S. Congress and the Greek people is not limited to the Greek Americans who have served as members, or the foreign policy issues debated in its halls. Rather, the very inspiration for the Congress as a legislative body are the democratic chambers of ancient Greece.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, the U.S. and Greece stood resolutely by one another in confronting the political and economic challenges of the 20th century, and are close partners in combating terror in these opening years of the 21st century. It is imperative that we continue to stand together in confronting this new challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 5, the House of Representatives passed a similar resolution to the one Senator MENENDEZ and I have introduced today. These resolutions reflect that the myriad ties between our two countries, be they cultural, economic or geopolitical, comprise a bond that can and should only strengthen in the wake of this devastating tragedy. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the people and government of Greece at this critical moment.</paragraph>
