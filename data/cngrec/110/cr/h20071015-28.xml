    <bill type="hr" number="448">H. Res. 448</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research, the oldest and largest scientific cancer research organization in the United States, was founded on May 7, 1907, at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, by a group of physicians and scientists interested in research to further the investigation and spread new knowledge about cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research is focused on every aspect of high-quality, innovative cancer research and is the authoritative source of information and publications about advances in the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas since its founding, the American Association for Cancer Research has accelerated the growth and dissemination of new knowledge about cancer and the complexity of this disease to speed translation of new discoveries for the benefit of cancer patients, and has provided the information needed by elected officials to make informed decisions on public policy and sustained funding for cancer research;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas partnerships with research scientists and the general public, survivors and patient advocates, philanthropic organizations, industry, and government have led to advanced breakthroughs, early detection tools which have increased survival rates, and a better quality of life for cancer survivors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas our national investment in cancer research has yielded substantial returns in terms of research and advances and lives saved, with a scholarly estimate that every 1-percent decline in cancer mortality saves our national economy $500,000,000,000;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas cancer continues to be one of the most pressing public health concerns, killing one American every minute, or a dozen people worldwide every 60 seconds;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting on April 14-18, 2007, was the world's largest and most comprehensive gathering of leading cancer researchers, scientists, and clinicians engaged in all aspects of clinical investigations pertaining to human cancer as well as the scientific disciplines of cellular, molecular, and tumor biology; carcinogenesis; chemistry; developmental biology and stem cells; endocrinology, epidemiology, and biostatistics; experimental/molecular  therapeutics; immunology; and radiobiology/radiation oncology; imaging; prevention and survivorship research;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, as part of their Centennial, the American Association for Cancer Research has published "Landmarks in Cancer Research" citing the events or discoveries after 1907 that have had a profound effect on advancing our knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer; these landmarks are intended as an educational, living document, an ever-changing testament to human ingenuity and creativity in the scientific struggle to understand and eliminate the diseases  collectively known as cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas more than 60 percent of all cancer occurs in people over the age of 65, and issues relating to the interface of aging and cancer, ranging from the most basic science questions to epidemiologic relationships to clinical and health services research issues, are of concern to society;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research is proactively addressing these issues paramount to our aging population through a Task Force on Cancer and Aging, special conferences, and other programs which engage the scientific community in response to this demographic imperative; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas May would be an appropriate month to recognize as National Cancer Research Month: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that there should be established a National Cancer Research Month to support the American Association for Cancer Research in public education efforts to make cancer research a national and international priority so that one day the disease of cancer will be relegated to history; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) congratulates the American Association for Cancer Research on its 100-year anniversary: "A Century of Leadership in Science--A Future of Cancer Prevention and Cures";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) recognizes the invaluable contributions made by the American Association for Cancer Research and its quest to prevent and cure cancer and save lives through cancer research; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (C) expresses the gratitude of the people of the United States for the American Association for Cancer Research's contributions and the progress in advancing cancer research.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin) the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution now under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Wisconsin?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="448">H. Res. 448</bill>, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that there should be established a National Cancer Research Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preventing and ultimately finding a cure for cancer is a major public health challenge. The resolution before us calls for the establishment of a National Cancer Research Month, a time to bring public awareness of the nearly 200 forms of cancer and bring hope and a cure that cancer research provides. Providing a National Cancer Research Month will remind us that basic, clinical, epidemiological, and behavioral research are integral to identifying causes and developing strategies for prevention,  diagnosis, treatment and cures for cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution also highlights the contributions of the American Association for Cancer Research, an organization that has been on the forefront of cancer research for more than 100 years. The American Association for Cancer Research was founded in 1907 by a group of 11 physicians and scientists interested in cancer research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the oldest and largest scientific organization in the world focused on every aspect of high quality, innovative cancer research, the American Association for Cancer Research has established a reputation for scientific breadth and excellence as premier researchers in the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the American Association for Cancer Research accelerates progress towards the prevention and cure of cancer by promoting research, education, communication, and advocacy  and fostering the exchange of knowledge and new ideas among scientists dedicated to cancer research, providing training opportunities for the next generation of cancer researchers and increasing public understanding of cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this, their centennial year of service, we commend the work of the American Association for Cancer Research and applaud their effort to make cancer research a national and international priority. We owe a debt of gratitude to organizations like the American Association for Cancer Research for their contributions in advancing the public awareness of cancer and for excellence among its membership in the field of cancer research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson), for his work in raising this important issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400139" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is a dreaded word in the English language, and it is called "cancer." Not a family in America is left unscathed or untouched by cancer and what it means to the families, and very often the terrible outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is a positive light, we know over the last several decades in particular, many health care professionals, organizations and groups have dedicated not just time and money and research, but their true passion to helping find a cure and treat cancer in many different ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know on Staten Island this week we will have the annual breast cancer walk that will attract thousands of people, many of whom are survivors, and many who will work in remembrance and memorial of loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I join my colleague, the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin), in support of <bill type="hr" number="448">H. Res. 448</bill>, expressing the sense of the House that there should be established a National Cancer Research Month. Perhaps it should be all year. I think it is important to at least acknowledge that National Cancer Research Month be this month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of establishing this month is to provide an opportunity to better educate the public in an effort to make cancer research a national priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the NIH, the National Cancer Institute conducts research into cancer in conjunction with numerous other institutes and centers. The NCI alone comprises one-third of the NIH's $30 billion budget. The work being done at the NIH towards cancer research is invaluable. Establishing a Cancer Research Month can help highlight what is being done by the scientific community and how the public can become involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While acknowledging and putting aside this month is important, what is even more important is continuing to support the research of those caring, compassionate health care professionals and researchers who will one day find the cure for all cancers, and that should be our wish and national goal and priority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. As our Nation's researchers continue to move us closer to a cure for cancer, it is important for us to recognize the work that these researchers do. Each piece of research, each project is a vital part of the solution that we will achieve when a cure is discovered. I thank my colleague, Mr. Matheson, for his work on this issue and urge passage of the resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for <bill type="hr" number="448">H. Res. 448</bill>. This bipartisan resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should establish a National Cancer Research Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year marks the 100th anniversary of the American Association for Cancer Research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to research and expanded cancer education, we have more early detectors, preventative measures, and treatments for cancer than ever before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we still have a long road ahead of us. The American Cancer Society estimates that in the San Bernardino County alone, nearly 2,500 Americans will die from a cancer-related illness in the upcoming year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every American is touched by this horrible disease; thanks to great strides, the number of cancer-related deaths is declining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strengthening research and public awareness of cancer will lead to more scientific breakthroughs that can increase survival rates for cancer patients--and give our cancer survivors a better quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for hope, and to support this vital resolution.</paragraph>
