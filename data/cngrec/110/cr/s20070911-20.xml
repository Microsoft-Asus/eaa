  <narrative>EXPLANATION OF "BY REQUEST" LEGISLATION -- (Senate - September 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11407">S11407</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the meaning of "by request" legislation and more specifically about my continuation of a longstanding practice in the Veterans' Affairs Committee of the chairman introducing legislation at the request of the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I expect that those who deal regularly with the Veterans' Affairs Committee, such as the established veterans service organizations, understand the meaning of a bill introduced "by request," I have recently become aware that there are some veterans who are unfamiliar with this practice and who, therefore, have misinterpreted my recent introduction of certain "by request" legislation as support for the passage of the bills into law. This is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our colleagues know, periodically the administration sends forward to the Congress legislation for consideration. Those measures that fall within the jurisdiction of the Veterans' Affairs Committee are referred by the Parliamentarian to our committee. In a tradition that began in the earliest days of the committee, the chairman, as a courtesy to the administration, introduces such bills on a "by request" basis. This is a courtesy that has generally been extended to every administration and  by every chairman, regardless of the party affiliation of the administration or chairman, and one that I am pleased to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I introduce legislation "by request," I am taking no position on the legislation. In fact, I introduce such legislation without including any statement or explanatory materials. I do so for the express purpose of both accommodating the administration and ensuring that others are aware of the proposed legislation so that they might analyze it and, if they wish, comment upon it. As chairman, I am committed to the development of the best possible policy in the area of veterans issues and  I firmly believe that this goal is most successfully achieved with the free exchange of ideas, not by stifling different points of view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this Congress, in accordance with this practice, I have introduced four "by request" bills, <bill type="s" number="1757">S. 1757</bill>, <bill type="s" number="2025">S. 2025</bill>, <bill type="s" number="2026">S. 2026</bill>, and <bill type="s" number="2027">S. 2027</bill>. It is one of these measures, <bill type="s" number="2026">S. 2026</bill>, relating to certain Agent Orange issues, that has generated the most confusion among some veterans. I hope that my explanation of "by request" legislation helps to clear up these misunderstandings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have taken no position on any of these four bills and simply introduced them as a professional courtesy to the administration. Indeed, at this point, I do not know whether these bills will receive consideration by the committee. For those who have views on some or all of these measures, I welcome your input. I ask that in providing your views you recognize that my introduction of "by request" legislation should not be interpreted as a reflection of my views on the content of any such bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="NATIONAL PANCREATIC CANCER AWARENESS MONTH">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am in support of <bill type="sr" number="222">S. Res. 222</bill>, a resolution that recognizes November as National Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. This resolution represents a way to educate communities across the Nation about pancreatic cancer and the need for increased research funding, early detection methods, and effective treatments and educational programs. I am pleased to be joining my colleague, Senator Clinton, as the lead sponsor of this important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many Americans, I have seen the ramifications of cancer firsthand. I support this resolution in honor and loving memory of the millions of Americans who have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and their families, and for my mother Jessica Udall Smith whom I lost to this killer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pancreatic cancer is hard to detect in its early stages as it doesn't cause symptoms right away. Also, because the pancreas is hidden behind other organs, health care providers cannot see or feel the tumors during routine exams. Because there are no early detection methods, pancreatic cancer often is found late and spreads quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, more than 37,000 Americans will receive a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and for over 33,000 of them their diagnosis will ultimately end in their death. While overall cancer death rates have declined, the number of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is increasing. It is projected that this year, 440 Oregonians will die from pancreatic cancer. That represents a 17 percent increase in pancreatic cancer deaths in Oregon over the last 3 to 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pancreatic cancer has been forced into the national spotlight in recent weeks. On August 18, 2007, Michael Deaver, one of former President Ronald Reagan's closest advisers, succumbed to the disease at age 69. Just last week, famed opera singer Luciano Pavarotti died after a yearlong battle at age 71. Something that is striking about both of their cases is that despite their celebrity and contacts, neither man had much more than a fighting chance of overcoming this disease. There are simply no  curative treatments--experimental or FDA approved--that currently are available to fight this disease, even when price is no object.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individuals fighting pancreatic cancer continue to face discouragingly low odds of survival. In 1975, the 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer was 2 percent. Twenty-five years later, the survival rate remains at an unacceptably low level of 5 percent, making this cancer the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. Indeed, pancreatic  cancer is considered the deadliest cancer, of which 75 percent of patients diagnosed with this disease die  within the first year and most within the first 3 to 6 months. Early detection tools, such as those that currently are available for ovarian, colon, breast and prostate cancer, would make a significant impact on pancreatic cancer, but those tools require a new investment in basic scientific research at the National Cancer Institute, NCI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support biomedical research and the great promise it holds in the development of new treatments and possible cures for the many types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Past investments at the NCI have helped drive new discoveries that led to the decline in overall cancer deaths in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Now is the time to expand our efforts in the fight against pancreatic cancer, but that will be impossible unless we find a way to secure more funding for the NCI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Network is a national organization that is working to comprehensively address the problem of pancreatic cancer by providing patient support, advancing research, and creating hope. I support their efforts to raise awareness of this disease and believe that it is important that we recognize November as National Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues support this resolution, which will help increase research, education and awareness for pancreatic cancer.</paragraph>
