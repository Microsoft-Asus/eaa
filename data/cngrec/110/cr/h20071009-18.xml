    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3530">H.R. 3530</bill>, which names a postal facility in Inverness, Florida, after Chief Warrant Officer Aaron Weaver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3530">H.R. 3530</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite on September 14, 2007, was reported from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Florida congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Chief Warrant Officer Aaron A. Weaver was killed on January 8, 2004, while on board a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter when it crashed during a Medevac mission in Fallujah, Iraq. He was assigned to C Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chief Warrant Officer Weaver's job in Iraq was to fly observation helicopters, monitor the enemy and send the information he gathered back to headquarters. He was on a Black Hawk helicopter en route to Baghdad for a checkup when the craft was shot down by enemy fire. Eight soldiers besides Chief Warrant Officer Weaver were killed. Chief Warrant Officer Weaver survived the October 1993 battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, but did not survive his tour in Iraq. He was a committed soldier and leader who  served his country with honor and distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Ginny Brown-Waite, for introducing this legislation and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, <bill type="h" number="3530">H.R. 3530</bill>, which will rename the post office on Highway 41 in Inverness, Florida, after Chief Warrant Officer Aaron Weaver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aaron was a resident of my district from Floral City who gave his life for his country while serving in Iraq. After graduating from Citrus High School in 1989, Aaron Weaver joined the Army. Aaron's grandfather served in World War II and the Korean War, and his father was a very proud marine. Following in the family tradition, Aaron and his two brothers joined the military as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the elite Army Rangers in 1993, Aaron Weaver received the Bronze Star with valor for extreme courage for saving another soldier's life in the battle of Mogadishu in Somalia. Weaver's actions that day and the battle in Mogadishu were portrayed in the book and film "Black Hawk Down."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aaron Weaver also fought another battle. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer, but would not let that get in the way of his mission to serve his country. The cancer could have easily been his way out of Iraq, but instead, Aaron urged his officers to let him enter the combat zone. In Iraq, Aaron served as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division and arranged to have his medical checkups for cancer while he was there. Aaron was actually on his way to a checkup not long before his tour of duty  in Iraq was to end when his helicopter crashed on January 8, 2004, in southern Fallujah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that in the simple of act of renaming this post office that we will memorialize Aaron's incredible story. Aaron Weaver epitomized courage and patriotism. We must never forget his great sacrifice to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to pay tribute to a remarkable soldier, and another true American hero, Chief Warrant Officer Aaron Weaver, who at the age of 32 paid the ultimate price while in defense of his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 8, 2004, he was on his way to have his blood work tested for cancer when the Black Hawk he was riding was shot down, killing all on board. As was noted before, Aaron was a testicular cancer survivor. He was still being treated when his unit was called to active duty in Iraq. He could have stayed at Fort Bragg, but that wasn't like him. His father said, He wanted to go to Iraq. When you're in a close group like that, you don't want your friends to leave you behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an Army Ranger, Weaver survived the October 1993 battle of Mogadishu in Somalia that was recounted in the book and film "Black Hawk Down." His heroism in saving a friend's life was also featured in that documentary on the battle. Not only was Chief Warrant Officer Weaver a fighter, he was a husband, a father, and a son. He was proud to serve his Nation. And with gratitude for his bravery and sacrifice to his country, I would urge all members to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="3530">H.R. 3530</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
