  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the education of all Senators, we just completed a caucus, and the two issues before us are FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Act, of course--and I am disappointed that we don't have something we can sign off on for that, but we are very close. I have told the minority leader that for more than 24 hours, that we are very close, and I do think we are. If things go as I think they will--Senator Bond and Senator Rockefeller have worked very hard--I think  we can complete it in 1 day--a long day, maybe a 10- or 12-hour day, but I think we can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding the stimulus package, I have briefly explained to the Republican leader where I think we need to go. He needs to consult with his leadership and staff to determine how we get to where we both think this will wind up, but that decision will be made fairly quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do say that I think it is going to take me--as my colleagues know, all last year I had four Democratic Senators running for President. I wish  they could all have been elected President, but only one can be, so two of them are out of that race now. I still have two Democratic Senators involved. As my colleagues know, next Tuesday is Super Tuesday, and they are both very busy, as is Senator McCain. So I probably can't get them back here until  Monday, but I do need them back. So the Republican leader understands that, and we will try to work something out today to give us a pathway to complete this stimulus package and FISA.</paragraph>
