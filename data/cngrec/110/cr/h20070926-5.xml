  <narrative>FUNDING FOR SCHIP VERSUS FUNDING FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10905]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday this House made the historic step of reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as SCHIP, so we can give 10 million low-income children health care. This plan not only ensures current enrollees do not lose coverage, but it will help cover 3 million additional children in low-income families who are currently eligible for the program but not yet enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, President Bush has threatened to veto the bill over and over. He instead supports his own plan which would actually result in thousands of low-income kids losing their health care coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to mention that the plan we passed is fully paid for. This is in stark contrast to the over $400 billion that the President has already asked the taxpayers to spend in Iraq. In fact, for the cost of just over 3 months in Iraq, we could insure these 10 million children for 5 years without adding to our Nation's debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time for the President to reconsider his ill-advised veto threat and pledge to protect health coverage for America's children in need.</paragraph>
