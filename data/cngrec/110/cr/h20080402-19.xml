  <narrative>THE IRAQ WAR AND THE IMPACT ON AMERICA'S ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1894]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, how much longer do the American people have to bear the financial burden of the war in Iraq? Between 2001 and 2008, Congress has appropriated nearly $700 billion for the Global War on Terrorism, most of that money going to fight the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investing in Iraq rather than our own country has contributed to our Nation's economic downturn. According to Columbia University Professor Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard University Professor Linda Blimes, "The Iraq adventure has seriously weakened the U.S. economy, whose woes go far beyond loose mortgage lending. You can't spend $3 trillion, yes, $3 trillion, on a failed war abroad, and not feel the pain at home." And Americans are definitely feeling the pain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the minute that I have been speaking, the Bush administration has spent $235,168 on the war in Iraq. It is time that we once again invest in America. Our focus now should be on helping those Americans who face foreclosure, who can't pay their gas and heating bills, and who continue to watch their finances erode, while funding for the war grows every minute.</paragraph>
