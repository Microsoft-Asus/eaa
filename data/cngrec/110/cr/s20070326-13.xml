  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the leaders of Northern Ireland took another giant step toward lasting peace earlier today when Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party reached a landmark agreement to share power in a joint administration to be established on May 8. The agreement gives hope to all who have worked so long and so hard to bring unionists and nationalists together in government on a permanent basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prime Minister Ahern of Ireland and Prime Minister Blair of Britain have been strong allies for peace. John Hume and many others have been heroes along the way. But the indispensable persons in this historic agreement today are Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, and Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. In reaching this agreement, they have acted to strengthen democracy and create a future of peace and stability for the future of that troubled land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the people of Northern Ireland salute them both for reaching this new day, and the world congratulates them as well. We know it was not an easy step to take. Their past disagreements have been intense and deep. The challenges they have faced often seemed irreconcilable, and the scars of the past have often seemed impossible to heal. Compromises have been difficult and painful to achieve. But with this agreement, Sinn Fein and the DUP have finally taken the essential step of looking forward  together--not backward--and have agreed at long last to work with one another for the future of Northern Ireland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The eyes of the world will be on them on May 8. All who care about lasting peace and stability look forward to the permanent restoration of the Northern Ireland Government at that time. In a world where political resolution often is elusive, these leaders deserve enormous credit for giving us hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I listened with interest to the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I do, myself, feel a great sense of pleasure and comfort in what has transpired today with regard to Ireland, and I wanted to say so.</paragraph>
