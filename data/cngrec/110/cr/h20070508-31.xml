  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2179">H.R. 2179</bill>, the Traumatic Brain Injury Centers Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced this bill because traumatic brain injury, or TBI, has become the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and it needs our Nation's full attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While new forms of military technology are routinely saving soldiers' lives from deadly explosive attacks, these survivors often return home suffering from TBI. Veterans suffering from TBI may have trouble relearning simple skills or might be left permanently unable to perform daily functions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2179">H.R. 2179</bill> would help veterans and their families cope with TBI by creating five traumatic brain injury centers. These centers would conduct TBI research, develop improved models for TBI care, and provide education and training on TBI for VA staff. While the VA has built an impressive medical system that includes polytrauma centers, <bill type="h" number="2179">H.R. 2179</bill> would ensure that the VA system includes centers solely focussed on TBI. These centers will be the focal point for research and education dealing with this  injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As American servicemembers return home, many of them suffering from TBI, we owe them nothing less than the highest quality care this Nation can provide.</paragraph>
