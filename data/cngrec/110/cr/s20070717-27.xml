  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">

    <paragraph>Mr. President, he is going to have all day to talk. He has the right to object, and he did that. We listened to his statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe the American people were entitled to have 2 days, at least 2 days of debate on the Levin-Reed amendment to change the course in Iraq. He may disagree. I would bet, with all due respect to my friend, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, that the people of Pennsylvania want a change of course in the intractable war in which we find ourselves in Iraq.</paragraph>
