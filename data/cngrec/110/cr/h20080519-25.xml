    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise for the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="1152">H. Res. 1152</bill>, which pays tribute to Arnold Palmer for both his distinguished golfing career and his dedication to excellence and sportsmanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1152">H. Res. 1152</bill> was coauthored by Congressman Ferguson of New Jersey and Congressman Baca of California, and is cosponsored by 83 Members of Congress. The bill before us was first introduced on April 24, 2008, and was taken up by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on May 15, 2008, where the measure was amended and then passed by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Western Pennsylvania, Arnold Palmer is regarded as one of the greatest golfers in the history of the professional sport of golf, winning over 90 PGA tour titles since the mid 1950s, and 62 champion tour wins since 1980. Arnold Palmer became the face of televised golf in America, and even today his talents and accomplishments in the sport of golf continue to set the standard for many, including the greats of today, such as Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Nicknamed "The King," Arnold Palmer has demonstrated excellence both on and off of the golf course by establishing the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida, and the Arnold Palmer Pavilion at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in honor of the contributions Mr. Palmer has made to the world of golf and the landscape of America, I urge the adoption of <bill type="hr" number="1152">H. Res. 1152</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of this resolution recognizing Arnold Palmer for his contributions to golf and to our society. How fitting it is that we honor him on the occasion of the opening of the Arnold Palmer Center for Golf History in New Jersey since it is he who made this possible and he who has made golf history so many times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You could, in fact, honor Arnold for his off-the-tee activities, if you wanted to. You could honor him for being somebody who proved that even with an unorthodox swing you could get to the goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You certainly could recognize him, as we are, for his 92 championships, 61 on the PGA Tour, including two victories at the Masters, two at the British Open and one at the U.S. Open. From 1960 to 1963 he won 29 tournaments. He won 10 more times in the Senior PGA Tour. He has had a long and successful career, one that continues to stand in its records in the American Golf Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is also, though, a celebrated course designer. His skill, his ability to, in fact, create constantly innovative and enjoyable places for America to golf has left a lasting legacy, both here in the United States and around the world. He even found a way to invent a golf-friendly drink, the Arnold Palmer, which consists of iced tea and lemonade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question this is a man for all seasons and all charities. He has raised millions for charities that fight cancer and other diseases. He has given of his time and money and energies for countless other causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also has endeavored to promote golf and serve as one of our finest ambassadors of the sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We often, here in the House, do resolutions, and we say, this is special. But I don't think there's any question that as America hears today that we have honored Arnold Palmer for golf, they'll say, what took us so long? Of course we should do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time and urge support of this resolution.</paragraph>

  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
