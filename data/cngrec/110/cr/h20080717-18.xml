  <narrative>CONSEQUENCES OF FOREIGN OIL -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6679]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our Nation's economic and national security is being threatened by our continued reliance on foreign oil. The pain at the pump is having a terrible impact on the wallets of American families. Simultaneously, we are sending billions of dollars overseas to buy the foreign oil we pay far too much for here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exploration of American oil and natural gas right here at home means we can rely less on unstable regimes and break the monopoly of foreign oil. The more American-made energy we use means less of our money going to line the pockets of dictators like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. We have the resources and the technology to get these resources in an environmentally sound way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must face the fact there are real consequences to congressional inaction just as there would be substantial benefits to adopting an all-of-the-above energy policy, which I and many of my Republican colleagues support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
