  <narrative>HONORING WKSK, A PILLAR OF THE ASHE COMMUNITY -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5415]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a pillar of the Ashe County, North Carolina, community, WKSK radio and its owner Jan Caddell. Most of the Fifth District of North Carolina is a rural landscape, and beautiful, mountainous Ashe County is no exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As people who live in rural America well know, local radio stations are often the lifeblood of vital community life. WKSK radio is just such a radio station, and recent audience measurement results illustrate just that. According to these results, WKSK has the most loyal local audience in its home county of any station in North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next year, WKSK will celebrate the 50-year mark of service to the people of Ashe County. The fact that nearly 55 percent of listeners in Ashe tune their radios to WKSK, seven times more than the next closest station, is a true testament to the emphasis that WKSK places on serving Ashe County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WKSK radio is a real community fixture, and I wish the station 50 more years of sterling service to the High Country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
