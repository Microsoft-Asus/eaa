    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, recently President Bush wrote that now is not the time to increase taxes on the American people. As the stock market hits an all-time high, employment is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a record low. Unfortunately, the first couple weeks in this House is not a good indication of Democratic leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In week number one, we effectively repealed the three-fifths requirement to raise taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In week number two, we passed a so-called PAYGO law that says any of the new liberal spending programs are going to be accompanied with huge new tax increases on the people of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And today, with the first major tax increase in 10 years, $7 billion is put on the backs of American energy producers that will directly translate to higher gas prices at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to sign a letter that is on your desk where we encourage the President to veto any bad tax increases, and we pledge to sustain that veto. Democrats and Republicans alike ought to keep this economy rolling. Please sign the letter that is on your desk. I welcome all of my colleagues to join me.</paragraph>
