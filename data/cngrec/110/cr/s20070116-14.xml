  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I note another Senator in the Chamber waiting to speak, so I will be relatively brief in comments on one other subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that an official in the Department of Justice has challenged the attorneys who have been doing pro bono  work for detainees at Guantanamo, raising an issue as to whether that representation is proper and raising the suggestions that their corporate employers might be interested in reconsidering their employment based on their representation of the detainees at Guantanamo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a little hard to understand how anyone in 2007 would raise a question about pro bono work being done by lawyers who may be undertaking or who are undertaking unpopular causes. That has been the long tradition of the legal profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first noteworthy example was Andrew Hamilton, a famous Philadelphia lawyer who represented Peter Zenger at the time when there were hostilities between the United States and Great Britain. Andrew Hamilton took on an unpopular cause and set the standard for lawyers to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recollect the trials under the Smith Act of the Communists where lawyers of the highest repute undertook the representation of the defendants in those cases, a highly unpopular matter. And in the Philadelphia prosecution of the Smith Act, some of the most distinguished lawyers of the city, again, undertook that representation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lawyer's duty is to undertake the representation of a client, and it is up to the court to make a decision on whether the attorney is right or the attorney is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This challenge by a Department of Defense official is in line with the recent position of the Department of Justice in seeking to limit the right to counsel for corporate officials who are being investigated, with the Department of Justice under the so-called Thompson memorandum taking the position that charges might be increased if the firm and the individual did not waive the attorney-client privilege. Then the Department of Justice objected to the firm paying the legal fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Federal judge in the Southern District of New York has already declared it unconstitutional to challenge the payment of the legal fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced legislation which would revise the Department of Justice policy even further than the revision by Deputy Attorney General McNaulty in the so-called McNaulty memorandum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when lawyers undertake the representation of individuals in unpopular causes, they are entitled to praise and not criticism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Missouri.</chair>
