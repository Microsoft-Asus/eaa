  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas National Volunteer Week will be observed during the week of April 27, 2008 through May 3, 2008;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National Volunteer Week will give Americans the opportunity to thank some of our Nation's most valuable assets, our volunteers, and to recognize the myriad of ways they improve our communities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the theme of this year's National Volunteer Week is "Volunteer to Change the World", and is about engaging individuals in service, inspiring a Nation to join a movement for change, and recognizing the deserving volunteers, including those that have received the President's Volunteer Service Award, for their work in their local communities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas National Volunteer Week began in 1974 when President Nixon signed an Executive Order establishing the week as an annual celebration of volunteering, and since then, every United States President, along with many governors, mayors, and other elected officials has signed a proclamation promoting National Volunteer Week;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas about 61,000,000 people volunteered through or for an organization at least once between September 2006 and September 2007, according to a recent survey by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, which represents more than a quarter of the total United States population;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas an analysis of data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging found that those individuals who volunteer have lower mortality rates than those who do not volunteer and research shows that communities with high levels of social networks have higher levels of parental engagement in schools, stronger local economies, less crime, and lower incidence of illnesses;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas volunteers have contributed to the enhancement and improvement of communities across the United States, especially with respect to the aftermath of the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas National Volunteer Week will continue to build awareness of the role that volunteers play in local, national, and international communities, and their commitment and dedication to improving lives, strengthening communities, and fostering civic engagement through service and volunteering: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the United States House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals and ideals highlighted through National Volunteer Week;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) acknowledges the diligent efforts of our major federally funded community service and volunteer programs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the millions of dedicated and caring individuals who have chosen to serve others through volunteerism; and</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 5 legislative days in which Members may have the opportunity to insert material relevant to <bill type="hr" number="1119">H. Res. 1119</bill> into the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the designation of April 27 to May 3, 2008, as National Volunteer Week, and to laud the efforts of volunteers who serve without reward to support America's communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Volunteer Week is an opportunity to engage individuals throughout the Nation in a common goal of service to better our Nation. This year's theme, Volunteer to Change the World, hopes to inspire all people to connect with their community and truly make a difference through working together to effect positive change. In addition to many volunteer opportunities, the week will recognize deserving volunteers with the President's Volunteer Service Award and other significant signs of thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, volunteers across the Nation will work on a wide variety of projects. Activities range from community arts projects, school renovations, park rehabilitation, and many more equally engaging projects. With a large force of volunteers working together, National Volunteer Week will demonstrate the power of volunteerism and highlight the strength of compassion. The large number of volunteers will continue to inspire the Nation to mobilize for positive change and help people discover their  ability to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteering has far reaching positive impacts on the community as a whole, and even on individual volunteers themselves. Research has shown that communities with high levels of social capital have a higher quality of life. Communities with strong volunteer networks, therefore, are healthy and dynamic places to live and work. Additionally, data shows that individuals who volunteer live longer than those who do not. Individuals and communities reap numerous constructive benefits from volunteering  and can be the center of positive social change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, once again I express my support for National Volunteer Week, and recognize all the hard work that volunteers put in on a daily basis. I encourage more people to become volunteers and recognize the fact that, by working together, we can more effectively meet the challenges our Nation face. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 1119, which supports the goals and ideals highlighted through National Volunteer Week. I am proud to have introduced this resolution, with my National Service Caucus cochairs, Representatives CHRIS SHAYS, DAVID PRICE, and DORIS MATSUI, as well as Representative BUCK MCKEON. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, National Volunteer Week was created in 1974, when President Richard Nixon signed an executive order to establish the week as an annual celebration of volunteering. Every year since that time, each President of the United States, along with many Governors, mayors, and other elected officials, have signed a proclamation promoting National Volunteer Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, National Volunteer Week is being recognized this very week, April 27 to May 3. Various events are being held throughout the Nation to promote the 2008 theme of "Volunteer to Change the World."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the history of the United States, Americans have valued an ethic of service. Volunteering not only has a positive impact on local communities, but also on the volunteer himself or herself. Those Americans who give their time to serve are valuable assets to our local communities, and National Volunteer Week is our opportunity to thank them for their service and to encourage others to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across our country, Americans of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities are donating their time and talents to schools, churches, hospitals, and local nonprofits in an effort to improve their communities and serve a purpose greater than themselves. According to data collected over the past 30 years by the United States Census Bureau, Americans are volunteering at historically high rates. Between September 2006 and September 2007, 61.2 million Americans donated their time to help others, by mentoring  students, beautifying neighborhoods, restoring homes after disasters, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, earlier this week I had the pleasure of participating in a recognition ceremony at a local senior center, the Red Land Area Senior Center in York County, Pennsylvania, where dozens of senior volunteers and others were recognized for thousands of hours of donated volunteer service time in 2007. In fact, the top two volunteers recognized, Jim Fitzkee and Leona Deardorff, each contributed almost 700 hours of volunteer service to this center in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteering is not only a rewarding but a necessary aspect of meeting the most pressing needs facing our Nation, including combating crime and gangs, poverty, disasters, illiteracy, and homelessness. Volunteering is also an important part of maintaining the health of our citizens, as research consistently shows that those who volunteer, especially those 65 years of age and older, lead healthier lives than those who do not engage in their communities. The intangible benefits alone, such as pride,  satisfaction, empowerment, and accomplishment are worthwhile reasons to serve and give back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I would like to recognize the diligent efforts of our major federally funded community service and volunteer service programs, thank the millions of dedicated and caring volunteers for their service, and encourage all Americans to give of themselves to make a difference in their local communities. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1119.</paragraph>
