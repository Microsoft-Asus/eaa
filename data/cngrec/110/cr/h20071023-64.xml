  <narrative>WITNESS SECURITY AND PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11911]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have stood before the House many evenings to discuss the problems associated with witness intimidation and its detrimental impact on our judicial system and our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, there has been another ruthless occurrence of witness intimidation in my home town of Baltimore City that I must report tonight. A family who spent 10 years living the American Dream found it destroyed in just 10 minutes. They came home last week to find their home smoldering and torn apart. The phrase "rats must be killed" and the word "snitch" crossed out with Xs spray painted on their walls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The couple's oldest daughter has been in custody since July for her role in a robbery of a taxicab driver earlier this year. Apparently, her co-conspirators believe she is cooperating with law enforcement on some level. Gang activity also appears to be involved. The word "blood" appeared on various parts of the house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Needless to say, the family will not be returning to their home. This is an innocent, hardworking family trying simply to live in peace. They deserve so much better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, when people are willing to cooperate with the police in Baltimore City and other jurisdictions throughout our country, sadly, it has become customary for their homes to be firebombed or for them to be threatened, attacked or even killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one can forget the tragedy surrounding the death of Angela and Carnell Dawson and their five children. The entire family was incinerated in October 2002 in the middle of the night when their home was firebombed in retaliation for Ms. Dawson's repeated complaints to police about recurring drug trafficking in her east Baltimore neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just 2 years ago, the home of community activist Edna Abier survived a firebomb attack that was launched just because of her attempts to rid her neighborhood of drug dealers. Just a few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to meet with another couple whose home had been firebombed because they were simply trying to cooperate with police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Carl Lackl was murdered outside of his home with chilling calculation just days before he was scheduled to testify as a witness in a murder case. His murderers lured him out of his home under the premise of looking at his used car that he was trying to sell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violent crime in the United States is on the rise nationwide, as is drug-related gang activity. However, if witnesses are too afraid to come forward, criminals cannot be prosecuted and our justice system has no credibility and cannot stand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I introduced <bill type="h" number="933">H.R. 933</bill>, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007, which authorizes $270 million over the next 3 years to enable State and local prosecutors who demonstrate a need for the funds to protect witnesses in cases involving gangs or other violence to establish short-term witness protection programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving protection for State and local witnesses will move us one step  closer to alleviating the fears and threats to prospective witnesses and help safeguard our communities from violence. The time has come for us to show our commitment to our constituents and the justice system because, without witnesses, there can simply be no justice.</paragraph>
