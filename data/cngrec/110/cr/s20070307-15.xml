    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize the outstanding achievements of today's youth in science and engineering. On March 27, I am pleased to join with the city of Las Vegas in welcoming the FIRST Robotics, FRC, Regional Competition to Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FIRST was founded in 1989 through the vision of inventor Dean Kamen to inspire interest and participation in science and technology. As a result of his leadership, FIRST has grown into one of the leading robotics competitions in the entire country. This  project has even grown to include a partnership with the UNLV Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to welcome 12 local teams as well as 50 teams from across the country and the world to Las Vegas and to UNLV. I hope they will be able to enjoy everything Las Vegas has to offer. It is also important to recognize the contributions of the parents, teachers, mentors, volunteers, and sponsors for this event. Without their support, I am certain this event would not be possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the backing of the entire Las Vegas community, I am certain that the FIRST Robotics, FRC, Regional Competition will be an outstanding success. Mr. President, I wish all the participants success in the competition and in the future.</paragraph>
