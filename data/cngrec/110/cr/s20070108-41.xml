  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="Introducing S. 163. A bill to improve the disaster loan program of the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="163">S. 163</bill>] Mr. President, as we all know, there was a tremendous amount of criticism of the Federal Government's response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year. Things are better now and the region is slowly recovering. But, having just finished the 2006 hurricane season, and with the 2007 season a few months away, we must be sure that if we have another disaster, the Federal Government's response will be better this time around. Disaster response agencies have to be better organized, more  efficient, and more responsive in order to avoid the problems, the delays, mismanagement, and the seeming incompetence that occurred in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation to improve the disaster response of one agency that had a great deal of problems last year, the Small Business Administration, SBA. This bill, the "Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act" makes major improvements to the SBA's disaster response and provides them with essential tools to ensure that they are more efficient and better prepared for future disasters--big and small. I should also note that this bill is  a result of intensive bipartisan work over the past couple of months and was introduced shortly before the 109th Congress adjourned as <bill type="s" number="4097">S. 4097</bill>. Unfortunately, there was no action on that bill so it must be reintroduced in the new Congress. I strongly believe though we can secure</paragraph>
    <paragraph>loud and clear from our impacted businesses that SBA reforms should be implemented as soon as possible. That is why in September, I sent a letter to the new SBA Administrator Steve Preston, expressing concerns on the lack of progress on SBA disaster reforms, which were included in <bill type="s" number="3778">S. 3778</bill>, the FY07 SBA Reauthorization bill reported out of the Senate Small Business Committee. In this letter, I requested his cooperation, along with our committee to pass this important legislation before Congress  adjourns at the end of the year. The introduction of this bill today, shows the progress that the committee made since September on this issue. I hope that this spirit of bipartisanship continues into the 110th Congress and that I can continue to work with my colleagues on the Senate Small Business Committee to reform SBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation offers new tools to enhance SBA's disaster assistance programs. In every disaster, the SBA Disaster Loan program is a lifeline for businesses and homeowners who want to rebuild their lives after a catastrophe. When Hurricane Katrina hit, our businesses and homeowners had to wait months for loan approvals. I do not know how many businesses we lost because help did not come in time. Because of the scale of this disaster, what these businesses needed was immediate, short-term assistance  to hold them over until SBA was ready to process the tens of thousands of loan applications it received.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this legislation provides the SBA Administrator with the ability to set up an expedited disaster assistance business loan program to make short-term, low-interest loans to keep them afloat. These loans will allow businesses to make payroll, begin making repairs, and address other immediate needs while they are awaiting insurance payouts or regular SBA disaster loans. However, I realize that every disaster is different and could range from a disaster on the scale of Hurricane Katrina  or 9-11, to an ice storm or drought. This legislation  gives the SBA additional options and flexibility in the kinds of relief they can offer a community. When a tornado destroys 20 businesses in a small town in the Midwest, SBA can get the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also would direct SBA to study ways to expedite disaster loans for those businesses in a disaster area that have a good, solid track record with the SBA or can provide vital recovery efforts. We had many businesses in the Gulf Coast that had paid off previous SBA loans, were major sources of employment in their communities, but had to wait months for decisions on their SBA disaster loan applications. I do not want to get rid of the SBA's current practice of reviewing applications  on a first-come first-served basis, but there should be some mechanism in place for major disasters to get expedited loans out the door to specific businesses that has a positive record with SBA or those that could serve a vital role in the recovery efforts. Expedited loans would jump-start impacted economies, get vital capital out to businesses, and retain essential jobs following future disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also makes an important modification to the collateral requirements for disaster loans. The SBA cannot disburse more than $10,000 for an approved loan without showing collateral. This is to limit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. However, this disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and these days, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running. That is why this bill increases this collateral requirement to $14,000 and gives the Administrator  the ability to increase that amount, in the event of another large-scale disaster. I believe this is a reasonable and fiscally responsible increase, and at the same time gives the Administrator flexibility for future disasters which will inevitably occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you may know, I pushed to get language in the last Hurricane Supplemental Appropriations bill in June 2006 to require SBA to develop a disaster plan and report to Congress on its contents by July 15, 2006. SBA provided this status report in July and I am pleased that, since then, SBA has been working on a comprehensive disaster response plan. That said, I believe that with the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season fast approaching, and other disasters possible before then, the SBA should be looking  at additional ways to improve upon this plan. This legislation requires SBA to report to Congress, by March 15, 2007 on the current status of its response plan and to provide us with a snapshot of where they were with Hurricane Katrina and where they</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act will provide essential tools to make the SBA more proactive, flexible, and most important, more efficient during future disasters. Again, I look forward to working with both Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry during this new session of Congress to ensure that the SBA has everything it needs to meet these goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my September 27, 2006 letter to SBA be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
