    <paragraph>Mr. President, as an alumnus of the George Washington University, GW, I wish to take a few minutes to pay tribute to president Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, who is retiring in July after 19 years of dedicated service to GW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Trachtenberg became the 15th president of GW on August 1, 1988. A native of Brooklyn, NY, President Trachtenberg came to GW from the University of Hartford, CT, where he had been president for 11 years. Before assuming the presidency of Hartford, he served for 8 years at Boston University as vice president for academic services and academic dean of the College of Liberal Arts. Previously, he was a special assistant for 2 years to the U.S. Education Commissioner, Department of Health,  Education and Welfare. He was also an attorney with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a legislative aide to former Indiana Congressman John Brademas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Trachtenberg has shown a strong commitment to public, civic, and personal service. He worked tirelessly to honor and enhance the relationship between the University and the District of Columbia, supporting and mentoring students, and leading and advocating for reinvention, change and civic engagement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1989, President Trachtenberg created the 21st Century DC Scholars Program--now the Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Scholars--which has granted almost 100 full scholarships to students from the DC Public Schools to attend GW. Under his leadership, GW's Multicultural Student Services Center has become a strong center for cultural awareness and celebrations, student development, and diversity training. His dedication to civic service is reflected throughout the University, its faculty, and its students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GW has experienced great changes and improvements under President Trachtenberg's leadership. During his tenure, the university has seen the number of undergraduate applications triple. Financial aid to students, research funding, and campus infrastructure investment have also significantly increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Trachtenberg has received numerous accolades from across the Nation and abroad for his service, vision, intellect, wit and compassion. His passion and demonstrated commitment to GW and its students, the city of Washington, DC, and the pursuit of lifelong learning are to be commended. I congratulate him on his record of service and outstanding leadership.</paragraph>
