    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to recognize for the week of May 20 an outstanding small business from my home State of Maine that will on May 31 receive the Maine Exporter of the Year Award for 2007 from the Maine International Trade Center. Oak Island Seafood, Inc., of Rockland, MA is a scallop processing company. In addition to providing quality seafood products to U.S. retailers, Oak Island Seafood has expanded to include Europe and Asia in its distribution network. Incredibly, 70  percent of its finished product is exported to other countries, most notably to nations within the European Union. Clearly, Oak Island Seafood is a Maine company that has wide, international reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oak Island Seafood, founded in 1995, has expanded to serve many comers of the globe over the past 12 years, while simultaneously maintaining its status as a unique small business. The company employs roughly 30 year-round employees in Rockland, an historic seaport community in Maine's well-known midcoast region where Penobscot Bay converges with the Atlantic Ocean. Their use of state-of-the-art equipment to deliver Maine seafood to the rest of the world exemplifies the innovation that small businesses  can use to do exceptional things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Maine's 5,500 miles of coastline, its fishing and seafood industries are clearly vital to the State's economy. And while everyone knows Maine for its lobster--which I would argue is the best--Maine's fruitful portion of the Atlantic Ocean and our many waterways provide a variety of delicious and often healthy fish and shellfish, including salmon, shrimp, and scallops. Oak Island Seafood's commitment to providing Maine seafood to not only the region but also to the rest of the world is remarkable.  As fish and other fresh and frozen seafood products comprise Maine's No. 4 export industry, it is crucial that we find ways to continue augmenting the work that Oak Island Seafood and other companies do in seeking foreign markets to showcase Maine seafood. Equally necessary, we need to do all that we can to protect and preserve our seafaring families and the crucial work they undertake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Maine International Trade Center, which is presenting the Maine Exporter of the Year award to Oak Island Seafood, is Maine's small business link to the rest of the world. It is a public-private partnership between the State of Maine and its businesses. The center's goal is to increase international trade in Maine and in particular to assist Maine's businesses in exporting goods and services. Clearly it sees in Oak Island Seafood the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation that make Maine's  small businesses so unique and successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again congratulate Oak Island Seafood on being recognized Maine Exporter of the Year and wish them well. The award, which will be presented to them on Thursday, May 31, at the 27th annual Maine International Trade Day, is truly something of which we can and should all be proud.</paragraph>
