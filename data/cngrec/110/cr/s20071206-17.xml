  <narrative>MORTGAGE CRISIS -- (Senate - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14817">S14817</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of more than 130,000 New Jersey homeowners who have a subprime mortgage. I rise on behalf of the 7 million American homeowners with a subprime mortgage, and I rise on behalf of the more than 2 million Americans who are or may be facing foreclosure in the coming year. This is a national crisis and certainly the time to respond is now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families across this country are having their homes ripped from their grasp, and there is no end in sight. Some have been saying that the storm is over and others have been sitting silently as the black clouds roll by, but the reality is this storm is going to get worse. More families are going to be facing foreclosure, more homes are going to be lost, and more damage is going to be done to our economy unless we act. There is no point in letting an invisible hand guide this destruction. If we  have any sense of human compassion, we will help these families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many families are in trouble because they got a deal they didn't understand, a loan they couldn't afford, and now their adjustable rate mortgages are resetting. But these families are only the beginning. The storm is only going to get worse. Many of the adjustable rate mortgages that were made in 2006 will explode with higher interest rates sometime in 2008. Another type of adjustable rate mortgages, known as payment option, is set to explode after that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already, foreclosure rates have doubled and tripled in many areas. Hundreds of thousands of families are already losing their homes. Over the next year, absent strong action, the wave will build into a mortgage tsunami.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only will families lose their homes, often the largest asset they have, but the ripple effects will devastate neighborhoods and the broader economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do not act now to help those families, the effects will be catastrophic. We can see the storm coming. We know the damage it will cause. So we had better reinforce our levies. In Congress, we should be working to help hundreds of thousands of homeowners modify their mortgages to avoid foreclosure. We should be working to pass a bill that will help homeowners modify their loan, for example, in a bankruptcy proceeding. We must pass, over Republican objections that we have had, legislation  to modernize the Federal Housing Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is the beginning. Banks and lenders, without the prodding of Congress, should be reaching out to help those troubled homeowners renegotiate their loan terms. This is not a suggestion, this is an expectation. President Bush is announcing today his plan to address this crisis. He has reached an agreement with major mortgage firms to freeze interest rates for 5 years for financially troubled homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I applaud the President for taking a step in the right direction, the plan simply does not seem to go far enough. It seems to operate under the assumption we only have to do what is minimally necessary. Depending on the details of this plan, on how they determine who is eligible, many homeowners may be left out in the cold. A strictly narrow approach will keep relief out of reach for many who need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned about the family next in line when they close the door on eligibility. I am concerned about the millions of Americans who cannot pay their bills, and I am concerned President Bush's plan will only help a fraction of the families at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hard-working families are at a crisis in America, and in a time of crisis they expect strong and bold leadership to help them through. We need to provide that leadership. Congress, the administration, and the industry all have key roles to play to help those families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what about the families who have yet to sign that stack of papers to get their future mortgage loan? What about when my son or daughter or yours buys their first home? What about the homeowner who needs to refinance out of an unsustainable mortgage? In order to protect those families, we need to make sure we stop predatory lending before it starts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I have repeatedly said that in order to prevent the mortgage crisis from happening again, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it. That requires all parties--all parties--to step to the plate and admit where they went wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A "not me" attitude will simply not work. Everybody who was responsible must be held accountable. I am proud to be working with Chairman Dodd on a bill that will hold all parties accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when I considered what I hoped to see in a final bill, I looked at all of those responsible parties, from the regulators, to the lenders, to the brokers and beyond. But one particular piece concerned me; that is, the secondary market. In order to understand what I am talking about, I think it might help to step back for a moment and walk through the life of a subprime loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A consumer decides to seek a loan to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage or, more likely, a broker or lender approaches a consumer about a new loan. As soon as the loan settles, the broker gets a commission from both the consumer and the lender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, here is where the secondary market comes in. Within 90 days after that consumer signs those settlement papers, the lender sells the loan to that secondary market, essentially selling the loan to Wall Street. That lender then washes its hands of the loan, but keeps the fees, regardless of what happens later on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once in the secondary market, the loan is bundled with thousands of other loans into what we call a mortgage-backed security. This bundle of loans then passes through one or more corporate entities on its way to the trust where it will reside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trust is usually a private company with an investing firm. The trust then slices those bundles of loans into different categories called tranches, and investors purchase security interests in the tranches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trust is considered the owner of the loan, and the investors are represented by a trustee who acts on behalf of the trust. A servicer, possibly the original lender, possibly another company, services the loan on behalf of the trust, meaning they collect and remit payments, monitor the accounts, and provide monthly reports to the trustees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the servicer is the only one in direct contact with the homeowner, most homeowners think the servicer is actually the owner of their loan. If the home goes into foreclosure, it is the trust that forecloses. But for the homeowner, they may not know who is foreclosing on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even if a homeowner had a predatory loan and has a good argument against foreclosure, if that homeowner cannot identify the owner of the loan and hold them liable, they cannot save their home. That is the life of a loan. It is no wonder it is a process few understand. Essentially, the loan is a hot potato. It gets tossed from the broker to the lender to the trustee. Along the way each one wipes their hands of responsibility after they send the loan on down the chain. When a bad deal is made,  each one points the finger at the previous owner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it is time to stop passing the buck. For me, that buck must stop with Wall Street. We cannot allow Wall Street to purchase loans without scrutinizing the details of that loan. If the trustee had to make sure each loan was a good loan, that it meets specific standards and practices, and the lender had to make sure it was a good loan, the brokers would have to stop making bad loans because they would not be able to sell them if they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I support a strong liability standard. If a loan is made illegally or contains illegal terms, the homeowner should be able to sue the owner of their loan. Otherwise, whom do they hold accountable? Their broker and lender could both be long gone. Nearly 100 subprime lenders have gone out of business in the last year alone, and then where does the borrower go for protection? They have to be able to reach the holder of the loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without assignee liability, a subprime bill has no teeth. Yes, of course, we need stronger broker and lender standards, but we also need a standard for Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. I am not talking about holding specific  investors accountable who act much like shareholders in a public company. They would see a reduction in the value of their stock if the company experienced financial losses but would not be personally responsible for those losses. I am talking about the trusts, the company who owns the loan. That is who must be liable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a popular provision I am calling for, but I think it is the right thing to do. We are in a crisis in America. It is going to take bold decisions to get the system back on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are not kinks that are going to work themselves out. We have seen that the industry is not going to police itself. Voluntarily changes are needed, but the bottom line is, without accountability, we are not going to see responsible behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said at the opening of these remarks, I am standing today for the American homeowner. If we want to prevent a similar problem from happening again in 5 or 10 years' time, our final subprime bill must hold Wall Street accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are steps we must take today in order to help tomorrow's homeowners. We cannot kick the can down the road. Let's make sure our homeowners get fair, sustainable mortgages and that future homeowners are not caught in a future subprime storm. Enough is enough. It is time for real changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have enjoyed working with Chairman Dodd on this issue over the past few months. I look forward, under his leadership, to passing a strong subprime lending bill to help millions of American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
