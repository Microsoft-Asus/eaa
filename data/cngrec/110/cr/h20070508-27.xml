  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this morning I rise in recognition of the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-two thousand American nationals were captured during World War II by the Japanese Imperial Forces. All 22,000 were detained on U.S. territory, the island of Guam. For nearly 31 months, these U.S. citizens were civilian prisoners of war. Many were executed and many atrocities were committed against them that included rape, physical torture, and other such efforts, all committed because of their loyalty to the United States. They refused to become a part of Imperial Japan. They would not  bow to the occupiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two Federal commissions have now recommended to Congress that we have the moral obligation to make our fellow Americans whole from the suffering they endured because of their loyalty and patriotism to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill>, the Guam World War II Loyalty Act carried by our colleague, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. This is an important measure. We must never forget.</paragraph>
