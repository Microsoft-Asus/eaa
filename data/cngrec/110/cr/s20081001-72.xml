    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to briefly discuss some of the amazing efforts broadcasters have made and are currently undertaking not due to government mandates or regulation, but rather as stewards of the public airwaves and as proud members of their local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know how my home State and our gulf neighbors were ravaged by the 2005 hurricane season. What many do not realize however is that our local broadcasters performed heroically during this traumatic time. Despite personal losses and risks to their own safety, broadcasters worked feverishly to keep their signals on the air before, during, and after these devastating storms. Their efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina literally proved to be a life line to many victims who were stranded by  the storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even when towers did go down during Katrina, the citizens of Louisiana witnessed a rare phenomenon in today's world. Radio broadcasters, who were competitors just the day before, banded together combining resources and personnel to establish the United Radio Broadcasters of New Orleans. By putting aside self interests, the United Radio Broadcasters were able to keep the citizens of Louisiana up to date with vital and even life saving information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we continue to see similar efforts benefiting communities across the country. For example, in a recent edition of Radio Guide, there is an inspiring article about steps one broadcaster is taking to improve its connection to the local community in times of need. Clear Channel has unveiled a series of emergency response teams that can be deployed to areas hit by natural disasters. Specifically, these teams operate as radio stations on wheels. Armed with mobile towers, generators, satellite/Internet  connectivity, and other radio infrastructure needs, they have the ability to keep a station on the air even if the station's permanent studio or tower is knocked out of commission. Some of these emergency assets were successfully deployed in Baton Rouge during Hurricane Gustav last month. While it is my hope that these capabilities rarely, if ever, have to be used, it is comforting to know they are at the ready.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This endeavor and similar investments being made by broadcasters across the country represent a strong commitment to serving local communities. While many here in Washington want to increase the level of regulation placed upon local broadcasters, I would point out that the examples I spoke of today were not dictated from some federal agency. Rather, these efforts were voluntarily undertaken by the men and women who are committed to serving the needs of their local listeners.</paragraph>
