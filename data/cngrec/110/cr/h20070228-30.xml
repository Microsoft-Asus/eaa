    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Black History Month. This gives us an opportunity to acknowledge how far we have come as a society, and to recognize the strides and extraordinary contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today our cultural diversity is a source of strength and enrichment for our Nation, and is a particular source of pride for the State of Maryland. But Black History Month also serves as a time for us to reflect upon the progress that still needs to be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-eight years ago, Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to Congress. Earlier this month we saw the appointment of Lorraine Miller as the first female African American Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as long as there are still firsts to be achieved, we must be tireless in promoting the ideals and values of the civil rights movement and its leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our Nation's history is one that includes harsh divisions along racial lines and, in many cases, deeply institutionalized racism throughout society. As a result of strong leadership, vision and tremendous sacrifice on the part of many, we have made significant progress over time and African Americans have made remarkable and enormous contributions to every sector of our society. Today, our cultural diversity is a source of strength and enrichment for our Nation and it is a particular  source of pride for the state of Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month gives us an opportunity to acknowledge how far we have come--to recognize the strides and extraordinary contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history. It serves as a time where our museums, cinemas, schools and other community centers can showcase the work of African American artists, entrepreneurs, business leaders, scientists, public officials, teachers, and the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Black History Month also serves a time for us to reflect upon the progress that needs to be made. It is a time to consider the range of experiences within African American heritage and to redouble our commitment to equality for all. Some 38 years ago, the first female African American U.S. Representative, Shirley Chisholm, was elected to this Congress. Earlier this month, we in Congress saw the appointment of Lorraine Miller, the first female African American Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives.  As long as there are still firsts to be achieved, there remains a reason to promote the ideals and values of the civil rights movement and its leaders. Indeed, the movement continues to represent a beacon for social justice in all of America's communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we remember the struggle of Dr. King and of the many others who were with him, as well as those who came before and after him, we honor those like Lorraine Miller who are still blazing trails. We honor the special contribution African Americans have made to the greatness of our Nation, reflecting on how far this country has come and reminding ourselves of how far we have to go.</paragraph>
