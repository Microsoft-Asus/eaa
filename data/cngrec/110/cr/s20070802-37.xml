  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to extend my appreciation and best wishes to my good friend, Ray LaHood, who recently announced his intention to retire at the end of the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His retirement next fall will mark the end of a long, successful career representing the 18th District of Illinois--first as a staffer for 12 years for then-minority leader Bob Michel and then as a distinguished member of Congress for seven terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in the district he has represented for over 13 years, Ray LaHood's constituents have always been his No. 1 priority. Long after Ray leaves office, Illinoisans from Peoria to Jacksonville will benefit from his attention to local infrastructure needs, whether it is the roads, hospitals or arts projects of central Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been a champion for economic development in rural communities, expanded use of alternative energy, and conservation efforts along the Illinois River. Ray and I also worked together earlier this year to help our Nation's servicemembers and veterans by introducing the Lane Evans Mental Health and Benefits Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But beyond his many legislative accomplishments is the distinctive spirit that Ray brought to his job. His time in Washington has been marked by a willingness to speak the truth and work across party lines--traits that have earned him the highest respect and admiration from colleagues on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For several years, Ray hosted bipartisan congressional retreats to bring Members of Congress together for an open dialogue about ways to solve the country's problems in a civil manner. At a time in which Congress is marked by ideological warfare and harsh personal rhetoric, Ray is always searching for ways to bridge the partisan divide and find commonsense solutions to the problems facing average Americans. He was--and is--the ideal successor to Bob Michel, the great statesman  who mentored him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, I will always be grateful to him for joining me in opening my Springfield office in January 2005 shortly after I came to the Senate. That small gesture of bipartisanship meant a lot to a freshman Senator and is a reflection of Ray's decency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of central Illinois will miss Ray LaHood's hard work on their behalf, and I will miss his friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Ray for his many years of service to Illinois and to his country, and I wish him and his family all the best as he embarks upon this next chapter in his life.</paragraph>
