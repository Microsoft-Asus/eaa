  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, eighty percent of health care dollars are spent treating chronic illnesses. These are complex cases where patients have multiple doctors, treatments, medications and tests. Errors can result from confusion and miscommunication, but case management can be effective in reducing these errors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, Medicare and Medicaid do not reimburse for patient care management. Unnecessary hospitalizations increased from about 1 percent for a patient with just one condition to 27 percent for a person with eight chronic conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government will pay billions to treat chronic illness that could have been prevented. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that care management can reduce re-hospitalizations of diabetics by 75 percent. Another study reduced hospitalizations of patients with heart disease by 50 percent. We cannot continue to finance a broken health care system and expect different results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to transform our health care system to make sure that we focus on patient safety, patient quality and patient choice. I urge my colleagues to learn more about patient management care programs by visiting my Web site at murphy.house.gov.</paragraph>
