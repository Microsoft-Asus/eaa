The certification shall include a report, in classified and unclassified form, detailing  the particular reason or reasons why the unit's extended deployment is necessary.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DWELL TIME BETWEEN COMBAT DEPLOYMENTS&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sec. 10004.  (a) The Congress finds that it is the policy of the Department of Defense that an Army, Army Reserve, or National Guard unit should not be redeployed for combat if the unit has been deployed within the previous 365 consecutive days and that a Marine Corps or Marine Corps Reserve unit should not be redeployed for combat if the unit has been deployed within the previous 210 days.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) None of the funds made available in this or any other Act may be obligated or expended to initiate the development of, continue the development of, or execute any order that has the effect of deploying for Operation Iraqi Freedom of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) any unit of the Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard if such unit has been deployed within the previous 365 consecutive days; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) any unit of the Marine Corps or Marine Corps Reserve if such unit has been deployed within the previous 210 consecutive days.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) The limitation prescribed in subsection (b) shall not be construed to require force levels in Iraq to be decreased below the total United States force levels in Iraq as of January 9, 2007.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this afternoon we take up legislation making emergency supplemental appropriations for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to help Americans cope with a sagging economy. One year ago, Congress sent the President a war funding supplemental that included clear direction to bring our troops home, home, home, sweet home, from Iraq by December of 2007. The President chose to do what? Shame. He chose to veto that bill. If he had signed that bill, most of our troops would be  home, home, home, sweet home today. Instead of bringing our troops home, the President demanded an increase in our commitment of U.S. troops--shame--and treasure to this terrible, awful war that has now entered its sixth year--sixth year. How long? How long, O Lord, how long?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 4,081 American soldiers have died--died. One can only die once. Over 30,000 U.S. soldiers have been wounded. By the end of 2008, the war in Iraq will have cost over $608 billion--over $608 billion. That is more than $608 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we are considering the President's request for another $178 billion--another $178--billion for the wars at a time when the U.S. economy is in trouble. Well, one thing is clear. Yes, I am sorry to say one thing is clear in this request: American fighting men and women--your brothers and sisters and mine--will continue to be in Iraq when the Presidency of George W. Bush ends on January 20, 2009. Shame. I was against that terrible, horrible war from the beginning and so stated on this floor  time after time after time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long after our military fulfilled its mission in Iraq, the White House failed to advance a viable strategy for establishing long-term stability in Iraq. In response, we in the Congress will support our troops--your troops, my troops, our troops--but we will also continue our efforts to get our troops out--O-U-T--of Iraq with honor and take care of our troops after they come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the third committee amendment, we set a goal for reducing the scope of the mission in Iraq by June of 2009. We ensure our troop readiness levels are maintained. We limit the time our troops will serve in Iraq. We require Iraq to use more of its surplus oil revenues for reconstruction costs, and we require that any long-term commitments this lameduck President may make with the Government of Iraq be considered as treaties, subject to approval by this Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the war continues in its sixth year--shame--our economy at home is in trouble. Because of President Bush's failed fiscal leadership, in the last 7 years the U.S. Government has amassed the five largest deficits in the history of this great Republic. President Bush has more than doubled the U.S. debt held by China, Japan, and other countries. Economic growth almost came to a halt at the end of last year, with the gross domestic product falling from 4.9 percent in the third quarter to 0.6  percent--0.6 percent--in the fourth quarter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growth remains at a paltry 0.6 percent this year. Since March 2007, the number of unemployed has increased by 1.1 million workers up to 7.8 million workers. In April, the number of Americans who were out of work for at least 27 weeks rose to 1.35 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the President--your President, my President, our President--is satisfied to allow unemployment benefits to expire after just 26 weeks. Did you hear that? Shame. I have reviewed the President's request carefully, and there is no evidence--none--of the President asking for funding to invest in America or to help struggling Americans deal with the faltering economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet the President--your President, this President, our President--has already thrown down the gauntlet by threatening to veto the supplemental bill if the Congress has the temerity--did you hear that--to add one thin dime above his request in order to help our citizens at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-two months after Hurricane Katrina, the President continues to resist efforts to help the victims of that terrible storm. The homeless population in New Orleans has doubled to nearly 12,000 since Hurricane Katrina. Only 48 percent of the pre-Katrina hospital beds in the region were staffed as of November of 2006. Violent crime in Louisiana grew 53 percent last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last 18 months, the President has designated 61 disasters for floods in 32 States. Yet the President has not--n-o-t, not--you know, there was a duel between John Shot and John Not. In this case, it was better to be Shot than Not. The President has not requested funds to repair levees or other flood prevention efforts, leaving our citizens in Arkansas--did you hear that--Missouri, Louisiana, and other States, vulnerable to more flooding. But when it comes to Iraq, the President wants the  dollars to flow, flow, flow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has already approved $45 billion requested by the President for reconstruction projects in Iraq. Despite the fact that the Iraqi Government is running a huge surplus due to excess oil revenues, our President--your President, my President, the American President--is asking this Congress--the buck stops here--asking you and me and the people in this Congress to approve another $5.6 billion of American taxpayer dollars for reconstruction in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President claims that by adding funding for America to this bill we are holding hostage money for the troops. Oh, my heavens, what hogwash. What hogwash. Last year, we sent the President a war supplemental that increased funding to provide better health care for our soldiers, better health care for our veterans, more funding to equip and train the National Guard and Reserve, more funding for mine resistant vehicles, and clear direction to bring our troops home--home sweet home. This year,  we once again take care of our troops, but we also invest in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee met and approved amendments that meet these objectives. Based on the committee action, the Senate will consider amendments that fully fund the President's request for the war. In fact, the legislation increases funding above the President's $168 billion request for the Department of Defense. We include increases for the health care of our troops, for Guard and Reserve equipment, for repairing and constructing barracks, for the mission in Afghanistan,  for military childcare facilities, for improving contract management, and for helping--yes, Senator Webb--wounded troops returning home--home sweet home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We honor those who have served America by increasing educational benefits for our veterans. We extend unemployment benefits by another 13 weeks. We honor promises made to the victims of Hurricane Katrina by funding a 100-year levee in Louisiana, restoring barrier islands in Mississippi, and by rebuilding hospitals, helping  the homeless, and fighting crime. We roll back Medicaid regulations that our Nation's Governors believe disrupt health coverage for  vulnerable citizens. We respond to dramatic increases in food prices by increasing funding for the global food aid program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also generous in providing humanitarian relief to disaster victims in China, Bangladesh, and Burma. We reduce funding for reconstruction in Iraq. We limit the size of taxpayer-financed reconstruction projects. And we require Iraq to match our tax dollars with their surplus oil revenues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation includes provisions that have broad bipartisan support. The veterans legislation has 58 cosponsors. The Medicaid legislation passed the House by a vote of 349 to 62. I have a letter from 56 Senators seeking additional Byrne crimefighting funding. We fund the Rural Schools Program, which runs out of money on June 30, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In total, the amendments include $194 billion for programs under the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee, $10 billion above the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This increase is less than what we spend in Iraq in 1 month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to my fellow Senators, Mr. President, this is responsible legislation that supports our troops, responsible legislation that honors our veterans, responsible legislation that helps our citizens cope with a troubled economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are still wrestling with the challenge of what to do about the supplemental appropriations that have been requested by the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, in our Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, chaired by the distinguished Chair's State colleague, Mr. Inouye, and also led on the Republican side by the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, we heard testimony from the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen. They drew a very frightening picture of what is happening to the military forces, not just in Iraq and Afghanistan and deployed elsewhere  in the world, but also in our training accounts, many other support activities for our military, pay and allowances--all the accounts that fund the Department of Defense that have been included in the supplemental budget request are suffering and many are running dry. The accounts are running dry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are at a point that is past serious. I am not going to say it is desperate, but it certainly concerns this Senator that we continue to wait and wait and wait on Congress to act on the President's request for supplemental appropriations for our military forces at a time when they are engaged in military action overseas and protecting our security interests here at home. So I am pleased the Senate is taking up this request to fund activities in Afghanistan and Iraq and to respond to domestic  natural disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we act expeditiously to consider this legislation so we can reconcile our differences with the other body and with the President. The President submitted the bulk of his supplemental request in February 2007 in conjunction with his regular fiscal year 2008 budget submission. He did so because Congress clearly expressed its desire for a full-year estimate of war costs. But Congress did not appropriate a full year's funding. Instead, Congress approved a $70 billion bridge fund  to support our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Enacting even that amount required a protracted struggle among the House, the Senate, and the President. As a result, the Department of Defense had to issue furlough notices, make a series of inefficient transfers and reprogrammings, and generally function in ways that detracted from its primary duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We find ourselves today facing a very similar situation. It has been more than 15 months since the President submitted this request. We have not approved or otherwise acted upon some $108 billion of that request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The personnel and operations and maintenance accounts that support our activities in Iraq and Afghanistan are running low. This morning, Secretary Gates was asked about the consequences of this situation, and I am going to read into the Record, with the permission of my colleagues, some comments directly from that hearing this morning. This is Secretary Gates:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is, however, a more immediate concern. Congress has yet to pass the pending $102.5 billion global war on terror request for fiscal year 2008. And as a result, the Defense Department is currently using fourth quarter funds from the base budget to cover current war costs. Shortly, two critical accounts will run dry. First, Army military personnel after June 15. We will run out of funds in this account to pay soldiers, including those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, operations and maintenance  accounts. Around July 5, O&amp;M funds across the services will run out, starting with the Army. This may result in civilian furloughs, limits on training, and curbing family support activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If war funds are not available, the Defense Department can transfer funds from Navy and Air Force military personnel accounts to pay soldiers, but that would get us only to late July. Using the limited transfer authority granted by Congress would also help get us to late July. Doing so, however, is a shell game which will disrupt existing programs and push the services O&amp;M accounts to the edge of fiscal viability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on. He went on into some more detail about other accounts. I think we get the picture. I got the picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our full subcommittee membership was in attendance for most of the hearing. I was disappointed that I was sitting there listening to the consequences of deliberate actions by the Congress to delay the availability of funding for our national defense, not just war funding for Iraq and Afghanistan; it has implications across the Department of Defense and into other accounts in other departments that are likewise affected by this denial of funding for our forces at a time when we need them to be  fully prepared, fully trained, and fully engaged to help win the war against terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to an earlier letter, so you won't get the impression that we have not been forewarned, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Gordon England, wrote us a letter on May 15 advising us that the Army would run out of military personnel funds by mid-June. He said if the supplemental legislation is not enacted by Memorial Day, the Department of Defense will be compelled to borrow funds from other services to finance Army operations into July and the Army would be out of options to pay its soldiers.  He said the Department would be compelled to constrain expenditures from the Army operations and maintenance accounts. He said it will have to issue notices of potential furloughs of civilians funded from this account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have been on notice from the Deputy Secretary and now this morning from the Secretary himself, as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been advised that the operations and maintenance accounts also fund the Commander's Emergency Response Program, a program that is critical to the success of our military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said those funds will run out in June.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record the letter from Secretary England.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, May 15, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR COCHRAN: I am writing you to follow up on the Secretary's letter of May 5 regarding the Department's financial posture and the urgent need for Congress to pass supplemental funding legislation for the Global War on Terror (GWOT).</narrative>
  <narrative>As briefed to senior Congressional staff last week, absent additional Congressional action, the Army will run out of Military Personnel funds by mid-June and Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funds by early July. Funding for civilian personnel is included in the O&amp;M account. Also included within the O&amp;M account is the authority to continue the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) activities in Central Command. CERP funding is a critical enabler that our ground force commanders are using  on a daily basis in Iraq and Afghanistan to shape the strategic environment. This authority will be fully expended in June, and reprogramming actions cannot extend this particular authority.</narrative>
  <narrative>If GWOT supplemental legislation is not enacted by Memorial Day, then the Department will submit to the Congress two reprogramming actions on May 27. These reprogramming actions for personnel and for  O&amp;M accounts will finance Army operations until late July by borrowing money from other Services. By that point in late July, the entire Department will be in extremis, having exhausted all avenues of funding and will be unable to make payroll for both military  and civilian personnel throughout the Department. Service members, including those engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan, would continue to serve but without pay since military personnel accounts would be exhausted.</narrative>
  <narrative>Further, at that time, O&amp;M funding would also be depleted, and DoD activities around the globe would be reduced to essential activities. Additionally, other measures would need to be taken, such as civilian furloughs and limits on non-essential operations. These highly disruptive steps would have to begin well before late July.</narrative>
  <narrative>While the Department has the reprogramming recourse on May 27th as discussed, if legislation is not passed by Memorial Day, the Department will still be operating with less than the desired effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, I urge you to provide the essential GWOT funding before the Memorial Day recess.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Gordon England,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what are we going to do? Are we going to let our men and women in the field stop their activities? Is that what Congress is urging be done, just sit down, stop what you are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan? I don't believe that. That is not the message this Senate wants to send or intends to send. But we should not put the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families here at home through such an ordeal and a period of such unnecessary uncertainty. We should not  cause the Department of Defense to operate at less than peak efficiency or take actions that are demoralizing for Department personnel simply because Congress fails to act in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know why it has taken Congress so long to act. I do know the request has been before the Congress for more than 15 months. Think about it: an emergency supplemental request for funds for national security languishing in Congress for 15 months. Most people don't know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have held hearings, we have had meetings with administration officials, we have heard testimony from General Petraeus, our commander in Iraq. Our Ambassador in Iraq has testified about the consequences on accounts for the Department of State which are also included in the legislation. But instead of marking up a supplemental bill to respond to the request a month ago, as had originally been planned, the majority chose to spend weeks talking with the majority in the other body, trying to decide  what to do, when to do it, negotiating with themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would have hoped that the legislation could have been brought up under a better parliamentary scheme designed to get the job done, not to just create political advantage, not just to put off the inevitable day of reckoning. That is an unfortunate choice to make. The fact is, had we followed the regular order, we could have had a bill to the President by now. Had he chosen to veto the bill, we might well be working this week to resolve differences with the administration and produce a bill that  could be signed or whatever the Congress decided to do to work its will, but to act. Instead, we are facing the approach of a Memorial Day recess with no clear path, no clear plan to enactment of legislation and little prospect for meaningful input by Members of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my good friend from West Virginia, for calling our committee to a markup of the supplemental. When it became apparent that the leadership plan was to bypass the Appropriations Committee in both Houses, our side wrote a letter to the chairman expressing our preference for a committee markup. I suspected that was consistent with his views, too, and that was correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know about the prerogatives of the Appropriations Committee and how the chairman safeguards those and how he respects all members of our committee. So he honored that request. But the other body has not acted in this way. There still has been no markup in the other body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are in this dilemma. We are asked by our respective Houses--the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense--to make recommendations, to produce legislation to take care of our country, to defend our interests, but we have not found a pathway to enacting a bill or responding in a professional way to the wishes of our Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it stands now, the Senate amendments contain a number of legislative provisions and appropriations that were not included in the President's request. The President has said very clearly he will veto this bill if it includes language that unduly constrains our military commanders in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan or which imposes artificial timelines for withdrawal. He has also said he will veto a bill that is too costly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not one who thinks an appropriations request submitted by this President or any other President is written in holy tablets, somehow immutable and not subject to improvement or change during the legislative process. The Senate and the House have a right to work their will. Since the President saw fit to recommend certain measures to protect the State of Louisiana from future hurricanes in response to Members' requests for those funds, I thought it appropriate to recommend certain projects  that would similarly be helpful to my State, which was also a victim of Katrina, to deal with the continuing challenges to the security and the well-being of the citizens of that region if other hurricanes strike in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has every right to look at those requests and make his decision. But I do not think he is going to veto this bill because of those requests that are included in the bill. I think he is sympathetic to the needs of the Mississippi and Louisiana gulf coasts and elsewhere in the country, so accounts that were depleted because of the destruction of the hurricane can be renewed and resupplied in this supplemental. The committee has approved including those funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to find common ground. This is what I am saying. We have had differences of opinion with the administration--Members on my side have; some on the other side have--for various reasons. But let's get to a point where we can work out our differences. If he wants to veto the bill, he will veto the bill, and we will see whether we have the votes to override it. If we do not, we can try again. Eventually these funds have to be made available. These requests are too important to be ignored any  longer. We need to find common ground. That is what I am saying. And we need to do it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not need to prolong this activity--describe it however you want to--any longer. We need to get down to brass tacks. We cannot allow political maneuvering on either side to obscure our core duty in this matter. We need to provide our men and women in the field with the resources necessary to conduct successfully the mission assigned to them by our Government, and to do it without undue delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not think the exchange of messages--strategy, or whatever you want to call it--is appropriate or necessary as a substitute for legislation. I do not think it will result in an enacted bill any sooner than had we simply acted in the regular order. But that choice has been made, and we must deal with it. I will do my best. I commit myself to work with the Senate leadership, with our colleagues in the other body, and with the President to find a way to get the job done in a timely manner.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank Senator Cochran for his views and his many courtesies. Last week the Senate Appropriations Committee had a 3 1/2 -hour markup of the important legislation that is now before the Senate. I hope the Senate can approve this legislation to support the troops and to help Americans cope with the sagging economy--this week.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to engage in a colloquy with the senior Senator from Nebraska and the senior Senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to join two of my three principal cosponsors on <bill type="s" number="22">S. 22</bill> in speaking about how important this piece of legislation  is, and how appropriate it is to have it be placed on the supplemental appropriations measure. The senior Senator from Virginia has an amendment we are going to offer. Hopefully, in the spirit of what the Senator from Mississippi just said, we will try to lay some of these arguments by the wayside and get  a bill that will truly provide the right kind of readjustment benefits to those who have been performing such exemplary service since 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="22">S. 22</bill> was introduced on the first day of this Congress. From that point we have had strong bipartisan and bicameral support. We now have 58 cosponsors in the Senate, including 11 Republicans. Among those Republicans is the senior Senator from Virginia, the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and the senior Senator from Nebraska, the only Member of this body to have served in a high-ranking position in the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week in the House, in spite of some of the debates that went into pay-for provisions and tax provisions, we saw a strong vote. We had 300 sponsors of this provision in the House, including more than 90 Republicans. Even on what was largely viewed as a partisan vote in other areas, we had 33 Republicans vote for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is supported by the current chairman of the Armed Services Committee; as I mentioned, Senator Warner, the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the former Secretary of the Navy; the serving chairman of the Veterans' Committee, Senator Akaka, who was just in the chair; the former chairman of the Veterans' Committee, Senator Specter. It has the strong support of all of our leading veterans organizations, including the American Legion, the Veterans  of Foreign Wars, the Iraq-Afghanistan Veterans. The Disabled American Veterans have taken a firm position, as have many more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have, I would say, at least 15 of the top veterans organizations having participated in the modification of this bill and strongly supporting it. Many major higher educational institutions and associations have endorsed this bill, including the American Council on Education, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, and the National Association of State and Land Grant Colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is carefully crafted. It has been substantially improved by the participation of all of the groups that I just mentioned plus many of our Members. It is appropriate on this legislation as a cost of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are people who discuss this in terms of cost. This is a bill that closely resembles the benefits that we gave to our returning veterans in World War II--a series of educational benefits which leveled the playing field in America and allowed those who served a first-class opportunity to move into the future. We owe these young men  and women who have been serving since 9/11 no less. We owe them no less. This is emphatically a cost of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we can spend $600 billion and, by some estimates, $3 trillion in a life cycle as a result of this war, the least we can do is spend the money in this bill to allow these people the best opportunity they have to succeed in their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been some resistance from some of the Members of this body--some of the Republican Members of this body--and also from the administration to this bill. Some have said it is too generous. I just discussed that. We worked very hard to make it fair and relevant to the priorities we should be having. Some have said it would be difficult to administer. We have worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs and with the Department of Defense on areas where they had concerns, and we addressed  those concerns. It is interesting to point out, for those who talk about the potential difficulty of administering a bill such as this, that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs was able to administer a very similar bill after World War II in a day where we didn't have computers, and they were able to do it for 8 million people. We are not talking anywhere near that number, so I believe we have addressed all of those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last issue that has been discussed, and it has come up again and again, is the concern that provisions such as are contained in this bill would affect retention in the Active-Duty military. As someone who has spent 5 years in the Pentagon, 1 as a marine and 4 as a defense executive working on manpower issues--and I am sure Senator Warner who spent more time in the Pentagon than I have would share this commentary--I believe the provisions of this bill actually will dramatically increase  recruitment and that the manpower model would benefit from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to retention itself, the discussion has been made that a bill like this should have, as a part of it, a concept called transferability, which would allow Active-Duty military people to transfer this educational benefit to family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make a clarification as to where the main target of this bill is, then I want to speak very briefly about transferability, and then I would like to recognize my colleague from Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there is a misperception in this country that because we have an all-volunteer system, we actually have an all-career military. We do not. A lot of people come to the military in the United States because they love their country, because they have a family tradition, because they want to soldier for a while and then move on to other things. Frankly, these are the people who have not been properly taken care of in the years since 9/11, and they are the principal target of our legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. military has done a very good job taking care of its career force. When you hear arguments about entitlement to transferability, again, they are talking about managing the career force. But these are the actual numbers that have been given to us by the manpower chiefs in the Department of Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the U.S. Army, by the time a cohort group has finished its first enlistment, 75.5 percent of them have left or will leave the U.S. Army at the end of a first enlistment. In the Marine Corps, 70 percent of the people who enlist will leave by the end of their first enlistment, either through attrition or deciding not to reenlist. For approximately 50 percent of the Air Force and the Navy it is the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you look at the Active-Duty military on the enlisted side, an overwhelming majority of them leave the military by the end of their first enlistment. These are the people who have had readjustment difficulties that we have talked about. These are the people who deserve to have a first-class education in order to move them into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This group over here, about a quarter of the Army, about 30 percent of the Marine Corps, and about half of the Air Force and the Navy, are the people who reenlist at least for one term. This is the group that has received so much of the argument of this administration on issues of retention. We need to take care of this group. We are prepared today to discuss a way to address this transferability issue with this smaller but very important group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I point out with the issue of transferability that Senator Warner had introduced a provision that was enacted into law about 6 years ago that allowed the Service Secretaries to provide transferability to military people at the discretion of the Service Secretaries as a retention device. This has been in the law for 6 years with respect to the Montgomery GI bill, the bill we are going to replace. It has almost never been used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the one hand, we hear all this talk from the Department of Defense about how important this is and how they hear about it every day when they go out to their meetings and their townhall meetings, but the Service Secretaries have almost never used this benefit that has already been on the books. So I am concerned about how widely this benefit would actually be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, I believe it is important, and our principal sponsors believe it is important, that we continue the existing law with some modification to give the U.S. Department of Defense the opportunity to test it again, to put it in this bill, continue it as law with some tweaks on it. As the Senator from Mississippi had said earlier, I hope with this gesture that we can get full support for this legislation and get it into law. The clock ticks for young people after they leave the military  in terms of how they are going to readjust to the rest of their lives. The clock has  been ticking for a lot of people since 9/11, and it is our duty to do something about it this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Nebraska, my longtime friend, Vietnam combat veteran, and former official in the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am grateful to my colleague, the junior Senator from Virginia, for his continued leadership and years of contributions to our country, especially on behalf of our veterans. I would like to make some remarks focused on the general scope of what this effort is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Virginia has laid out very concisely, cogently, some of the realities of the force structure we have today and why it is important and in the opinion of almost 60 Senators and over 300 House Members that we take the so-called GI educational benefits this country committed to beginning in 1944 when President Truman signed the first bill and roll those forward into the 21st century, because what has happened is that we are now caught in a different kind of a world, different kinds  of wars, different kinds of requirements. But what has not changed is the absolute necessity that we rely on quality individuals to man our force structure. In a world that is far more complicated, combustible, and dangerous than ever before, it has required new sets of skills, obviously technologies, to defend our country, our interests in the world. It is that reality that we must adjust to within the framework of all of our policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are doing here is not adding a new benefit, we are not adding a welfare program; what we are doing is we are bringing up to date the benefits earned by men and women who have committed a good part of their lives to our country. We had that debate a long time ago, whether America wants to do that. Now, unless there are some individuals in the Congress or in America who want to go back and reengage that issue, we can do that, but I do not think that is the case. I think we recognize those  who serve. I think we also, in recognizing their service, understand they have earned certain benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are rotating a GI educational benefit system forward into the 21st century, a system that has not been changed for 25 years. And as reflected in Senator Webb's charts--these, by the way, I remind our colleagues, as was noted by the junior Senator from Virginia, these are not his numbers, these are numbers from the Defense Department. So if we are to take care of our people, because we rely on our people to take care of us, if we rely on that rifleman, that person at the bottom  who has always been the one whom we have asked to fight the war--fight the war, die in the war, sacrifices by their families, those who do not come back, many who come back are seriously scarred, wounded, will never recover. That is the reality of the world in which we are living. So we are talking about a relevant system, relevant to today's costs for an education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I benefited from the GI bill when I came back from Vietnam, as did the junior Senator from Virginia, as did the senior Senator from Virginia when he came back from World War II, the Korean war, as did almost every veteran in this body who has fought in a war benefitted from this program. So it is important that we get something very clear; that is, this is not a new program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as the Senator from Virginia noted, this then fits into the larger framework of a cost of war. Unless we are going to just discard the people whom we count on, that rifleman at the bottom who does not have much say in all of this, by the way--he is told to take the hill; he takes the hill. He doesn't set policy. Our military doesn't set our war policy. They have input and influence into the strategy, into the tactics, but we, the elected officials of America, starting with the President,  his team, and the Congress, we are the ones who set policy, we are the ones who engage our Nation in war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, just as an aside, I think we should go back to a day in this country when we wanted and did, in fact, commit our Nation to war, we should declare that in the Congress of the United States, we should declare war rather than these skirmishes that we kind of on the side fund and we on the side deal with. We on the side never really come clean with the reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is an opportunity for us to do what is right and what is wise--what is right and wise; that is, to bring this educational benefit program forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Virginia noted something that is very important--the administration of this program. That is always important, who administers the program, how will it work, can it work?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have worked very diligently--our staffs, with many Members involved--with the Veterans' Administration, the Department of Defense, to make this work. We have ample testimony, recent testimony before the Veterans' Committee in the Senate from senior Veterans Administration' officials saying: This can work. We can now do this. We can implement this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost. The cost is an interesting debate, in my opinion, because if, in fact, we are a nation that can afford the cost of war, we can afford $12 billion a month waging the war in Iraq, we can afford all the requirements it takes for a nation to go to war, but somehow we are disconnected from the obligation and responsibility of taking care of those who fight the wars? We somehow can't find the money for that? We somehow want to look the other way? I don't think so. I don't think the American  people--and they never have been--are in agreement with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As to the retention issue, the Senator from Virginia again addressed this. Even taking the Senator's arguments, as clearly as the Senator from Virginia did, and making those arguments--and I can make them again, and others will--I am not sure that is even necessary because this is not a retention bill. There is a consequence to this bill, of course. We should frame within the text and the context of this bill a dynamic of retention: How can we make it attractive for our young people to serve  aside from the fact that they love their country, they want to be part of something larger than their own self-interest, they want to make a noble contribution to freedom, to the world, to peace, to their families, to their future? And you can't substitute that. That is bigger than any benefit. Of course it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the reality is, just as Harry Truman and just as our leaders back during World War II understood, just as every leader has understood since then, as we have continued to commit to our veterans, those who fight the wars and their families, it is wise to reinvest in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do you reinvest in our society? Well, one way,  certainly an important way, is education. It is assuring these men and women who give of themselves--in a very selfless way that very few people do, by the way, especially today, when you look at less than 1 percent of the society, the American society, our population, less than 1 percent is bearing all of the burden. They are carrying it all for the rest of us. What do I mean by that? Because they are the few who are serving in two wars, rotation after rotation in Afghanistan and Iraq and on  duty all over the world and in this country. So when they are finished, just as the Senator from Virginia has noted, in the Army and Marine Corps, it is more than 50 percent, after the first enlistment, that leave. Would it not be smarter, would it not be wise to reinvest in these people, to help them get an education so they can continue to contribute to America and strengthen America in every way?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National security is not only about the military. In fact, I think we can make a pretty strong argument that the military is obviously an essential component, but just as important is the economic vitality, this culture, the society, the commitment, the education of a society. That all has an awful lot to do with the national security of a nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This makes sense. This bill makes sense. It makes sense on this supplemental. This isn't divorced from that. This isn't an add-on to that. This isn't something we just invented. This is part of a larger context of service and earned benefits for those who serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that we are finding more and more ways to enlist more individuals in this effort. I think with what the Senator from Virginia noted as to an add-on on transferability, it  makes it more attractive. The senior Senator from Virginia, I assume, is going to speak to that when he takes the floor in a moment. I think when we frame up all of this, as the Senator from Virginia noted, this is the product of a composite of contributions from many  individuals, from almost every veterans group I am aware of, from people who care about their country, who care about the veterans who serve this country, and care about our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the leadership of the junior Senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand in our series of colloquies that the senior Senator from Virginia is prepared to make some comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The senior Senator from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Hagel, and I thank my distinguished partner in the Senate, Mr. Webb. We have known each other for a very long time, over 30 years. When I was in the Pentagon, we were associated together at that time. He had a long and distinguished career in the U.S. Marine Corps and following that in the Department of Defense in two very senior--including Secretary of the Navy--positions of civilian leadership. He has shown that same  leadership from the day he crossed the threshold of the Senate, that this is his No. 1 priority. And how pleased and, indeed, humbled I am to join him and my good friend, Senator Hagel, in making this possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are trying to do, very simply, is to enable this generation of young men and women to have, as nearly as possible, the same benefits as former generations--most specifically, the generation from World War II and the Korean War generation of which I was a part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both of these gentlemen are highly decorated combat veterans. I have a less significant career in the service. But all three of us bring our own experience to bear on thinking this is essential for this generation who is going out and fighting as courageously as any servicemember in the history of this country and, in fact, perhaps with an added measure of courage because they are fighting an enemy that is so difficult to define, an enemy that does not have any state-sponsored nation attached  to it, which is the form of the terrorism today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has graced us on this floor for the purpose of listening in on this debate, for guiding it through the current supplemental bill in the Senate, and including Senator Webb's bill in it. Indeed, I saw Senator Murray here and Senator Inouye, who both helped us get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, much has been said by my colleagues about how we are trying to bring up the level of funding for the GI bill from the current existing Montgomery GI bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this document which traces the history of what is known as the Pell Grant Program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>That is a very fine program enabling individuals who are qualified to go to colleges and universities all across America--all across America--to any college or university that accepts them, to obtain a grant from the United States of America to help him or her with their tuition and other expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the interesting thing. The program was initiated in 2000, but I use as a benchmark the year 2001. There were 4.8 million individuals who accessed this program. The Congress appropriated $8.7 billion to defer their expenses. Fast forwarding from 2001 until 2009, the total request is as follows: roughly, a 20-percent increase in the number of individuals going. It goes from 4.8 million to 5.7 million, a little under 1 million. Now here is the astonishing thing. The amount of money Congress  appropriates for the 2009 class of 5.7 million is $18.9 million.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>My understanding of the program is that would be $18 billion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for correcting me. In the year 2009, it is $18.9 billion. That is over a 100-percent increase, keeping up with inflation, keeping up with added expenses. But that is not the case with the existing GI bill. Although there has been a CPI adjustment, it doesn't compare to how Congress has treated the category, a well-deserving category, of the Pell grants. So this is essentially what we are trying to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, the three of us, have worked together on the question of transferability. I wish to go back and acquaint the Senate with some history. I was chairman in 2001 of the Armed Services Committee, and I worked with a distinguished former colleague, Senator Max Cleland. He introduced, along with myself, on May 23, 2001, an amendment on the ability of a service person, after stipulating periods of time, to have some transferability to his family. The cosponsors, at that time, of the original  amendment were Senators Bingaman, Dayton, Kennedy, Levin, and myself. I was the only Republican. There were several other Senators, four more. I was the only Republican who stepped up at that time. Later it became a bipartisan effort. In the evolution of events that year, we marked it up. But here is the interesting</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pay my respect to those who formulated the concept of transferability originally in the Senate. It is the law today. I will send to the desk later today an amendment, which Senator Webb, Senator Hagel, and I worked on. We are joined by two other original cosponsors, Senator Levin, current chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Akaka, current chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. This amendment will be filed at the desk this afternoon.  We are going to make a technical adjustment to it. The purpose of this amendment is to provide a 2-year pilot program of transferability. We track as closely as possible the original law I recited that was enacted on December 28, 2001. The details will be provided to the full Senate when we file the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially, we are asking an individual to complete his or her first 4-year term of enlistment and then, if they enlist for another 6 years, there is a vesting over a period of time of the  full transferability of their benefits, as a sequence of time, to their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the letter from the Secretary of Defense to the Senate, which talked about the need for transferability--and I am not sure at that time whether he was referring to the existing law or a new law--he said: "Transferability supports military families, thereby enhancing retention."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There it is. We are meeting the Secretary of Defense's letter to the Senate expressing the need for this transferability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my career, winding up 30 years in the Senate, I can't think of a piece of legislation in which I have had a greater emotional involvement. I am so pleased to share it with my good friend, the junior Senator from Virginia, and my friend from Nebraska. As I said when we first began to debate this bill, with a deep sense of humility, it is highly unlikely I would have ever achieved the opportunity to come to the Senate had it not been for the GI bill given to me by the United States in return  for modest service in the last year of World War II and then a second period of active duty service during the Korean War, this time in the Marine Corps. I feel it so strongly in my heart. I don't know of any time I have felt more strongly the need to do something than this today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the years, I have been to Iraq many times, Afghanistan. Throughout the intervening period, I visited military bases and spent as much time as I could with the men and women of the Armed Forces today. Each of us does the same thing, works with our military. On Monday, I was privileged to go into the State that Senator Webb and I are privileged to represent. We worked together to get funding in years past--and he is supporting it today--to build a new armory for the National Guard  in Virginia, a famous regiment that fought in World War I and World War II. Members of that regiment were the first to go in on D-Day. They fought subsequently. I felt at that time that we are doing the right thing with this bill, taking care of those future guardsmen and reservists and active-duty individuals. This is the right thing for the Senate to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand there are honest differences of viewpoints and approaches. That is true with all legislation. Other colleagues have put in a different bill. It had a section on transferability. In some ways, it tracked what is existing law but not in the way we are doing this. This amendment, this bill, if amended, will bring forward existing law, incorporate it into the underlying amendment sponsored by Senator Webb and ourselves, and that will become, hopefully, at some point in time  the new law that will govern future benefits of our GIs and sailors, airmen and marines. We file it today because I do not know exactly how this supplemental will go through. I don't know if there will be a window of opportunity put on it. If there is,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will affix to it that bill so it will eventually be amending the underlying bill, which I hope becomes law very soon as a component of the supplemental process now being undertaken by the Senate and the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I salute my colleague from Virginia and my colleague from Nebraska. We have been here together. We have shared many opportunities to do something such as this together but none as important as this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do not wish to use much of the Senate's time--just a few moments--but I came to the floor to say some words to my good friend, Senator Kennedy, and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard the early news, and then we heard the late news, in which you have been described as being a little bit more ill than we thought. I wish to say to you and your family, as a fellow Senator from the other side of the aisle: I wish for you the best and hope the Good Lord intends for you to get well so you can come back and accomplish some more things and so you and I can have some more arguments and so you and I can have red faces when you argue and I argue and my wife calls up and says:  You both are arguing so much that your faces are so red nobody will listen to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That happened once, and I did communicate to Senator Kennedy that my wife had told me I was getting too red in the face because I was yelling. I asked her: What about Senator Kennedy? And she said: Well, that is not your business, but he is yelling too much too. So I told him that, and he had a big laugh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to say to him that this great big bill we are working on--parity for the mentally ill by the insurance companies of America; about a 6-year project of his and mine--the House sent us back the bill today, Senator Kennedy, believe it or not. After all these days we have been wishing we could get something, they sent us that bill today. They did not send us exactly our bill, so who knows how much longer we will have to work at it. But this one, big bipartisan bill you started helping  me with when I was in the majority, we have not got it there yet, but we will. It has been a pleasure working with you on that and many other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But most of all, I came to the floor knowing it is not easy to get a hold of you, and I do not intend to try to bother anybody, but at least in the Senate, we are free to speak, so I am speaking how I feel: that I hope you get well, and I hope the Dear Lord blesses you and your wonderful wife, whom I have known, not as well as I know you, but what a nice lady she is. On behalf of Nancy and myself, we say to her, we hope everything goes the very best it can. You are in the best of care--and that  is what you should have--and we hope you get well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you. I thank the Senate for the few moments yielded to me.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, midday today during our Democratic Caucus, when we learned our colleague Senator Kennedy is now facing some very serious health problems, it is an understatement to say we were all shocked by that news and saddened by it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy has for decades been a major presence in this Senate Chamber. He is a friend, a colleague, and all of us have said prayers today for his recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy has faced much adversity in his life, but he has also contributed so much to this country. I know he will meet this challenge with the same strength and the same grace he has met other challenges. It is my purpose today to say it is my prayerful hope, and I know the prayerful hope of all Members of this Chamber, that in the row behind me and four desks to my left we will once again at some point in the future see Senator Kennedy among us to continue his service  to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers are with our colleague for a full recovery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to visit for a few moments on the piece of legislation in front of us which includes the GI bill. We have had a GI bill in this country for many decades. There is a new GI bill in the underlying legislation that is brought to the floor of the Senate. I am so proud to be a cosponsor of it and to be a part of what so many in this Chamber have put together. The GI bill is such an important part of what this country does and says to those who serve this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend I traveled, and at an airport in Minneapolis there was a family--a man, a woman, and three children; three very young children--getting on the same plane I was boarding. They were from North Dakota but they lived on a military base in Georgia. The wife came up to me and said hello. She said: My husband has done three deployments in Iraq. I hope--I so hope--that you can find a way to end this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a woman who has watched her husband leave for Iraq three times; a woman who is taking care of her three young children while her husband is deployed three times to the country of Iraq. I visited with her husband and her children, and I know that family is proud to serve their country. I know the entire family is proud of that soldier's service. But I also know the costs of that service, because you could see it in the eyes of that soldier's spouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also on Saturday morning I went to an event in one of our cities. It was a homecoming event for 35 soldiers who had just come back from deployment in Afghanistan. These were National Guard soldiers. They too were so proud to have served their country, and some of them had been deployed twice; two deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. One or two had been on their third deployment. Their families were there and all of them were enormously relieved and pleased to have their loved ones home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was thinking about those events: meeting a family at an airport, a soldier who is stationed in Georgia but who is a North Dakota native, and visiting with the family members at the National Guard event and saying thank you to them from a grateful nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was thinking about a day much earlier when I was asked to present medals earned by an American Indian who served in the Second World War but had never received his medals. His name was Edmund Young Eagle. He was a Standing Rock Sioux Indian. He was someone who enlisted in the Army in the Second World War and went to war. He served in northern Africa, Normandy, and across Europe. He served with great distinction as an American soldier in some very difficult fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then came back to the Indian reservation and lived kind of a tough life. He never had very much. He never married. He never had very much in his life, but he lived a good life nonetheless. At the end of his life, he was in the veterans home and then got sick and was put in the veterans hospital in Fargo, ND. His sister contacted my office and asked if her brother could receive the medals he had earned during the Second World War but had never received. We said of course. On a Sunday morning  in Fargo, ND, I went to the veterans hospital with the medals for Edmund Young Eagle. The doctors and the nurses and others from the hospital crowded into his hospital room that Sunday morning. Edmund was sick with lung cancer. I didn't know it at the time, but he didn't have many days left. He died about a week later of lung cancer. But on that morning he was fully aware of what was happening, and I was there granting the wish of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>proudest days of my life. He died about a week later. But he served his country and was enormously proud of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are so many circumstances around this country where one by one or in groups we honor our soldiers because they put on America's uniform. This morning, soldiers halfway around the world not only put on a uniform, but put on body armor and went out in harm's way, some to be shot at. They didn't ask why; they just did what their country asked them to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the question is: When it is all over, when they come home and their service is done, what will their country say then? What will their country say to them, other than thank you?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we said in the Second World War with a GI bill was when those soldiers came home, we offered them an opportunity to go to college, to help them to be able to purchase a home. So a substantial number of returning soldiers went to college and got a college degree. They went back home and married their sweetheart. They built a home. They built a community. They built their churches. They expanded the middle class. They created an economic boom in this country. Later, it was estimated that for  every dollar we spent on the GI bill, $7 was returned because it was an unbelievably good investment for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Webb, Senator Warner, Senator Hagel, Senator Murray, and so many others--myself included--as cosponsors of this bill have said it is time again to write a GI bill that is appropriate for wartime and for returning veterans. When soldiers return and become veterans, the question is: What will the GI bill offer for them? How will we invest in their lives, and thereby invest in this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous GI bill was the Montgomery bill written during peacetime. Frankly, it does not do what we have historically been able to do and willing to do for those who serve our country, in addition to saying thank you. The Montgomery bill existed--and we are pleased it did--but this new GI bill is something very different. It tries to say to soldiers, as we did some 60 years ago, not only thank you, but we want to invest in your lives and invest thereby in this country. It is a new GI bill.  It allows an opportunity to go to college and to be able to pay the in-State cost of college with a stipend for living during that period of time that you get your college degree. It invests in the lives of those who have invested their lives in this country. This is a very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am told there are some who now come to the floor of the Senate, nearing three-quarters of a trillion dollars having been spent on emergency supplemental appropriations bills requested by President Bush to prosecute the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and say: Well, we can afford that and we have to do that on an emergency basis, but we don't have the money to try to help veterans when they come home. A veterans program is the cost of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the cost of war. How does anyone say that somehow the three-quarters of a trillion dollars for so many hundreds and thousands of different accounts and contractors and replenishment of various accounts is more important than the single account of the GI bill, which says we want to invest in our soldiers? How does anybody say those myriad other accounts are more important than investing in our soldiers when they become veterans? I don't understand that. It makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a significant claim and priority for this country to understand that part of the cost of war is to provide health care that is promised to veterans and a GI bill this country can be proud of, which invests in those veterans and our country. That is what this bill is about. This new GI bill is every bit as important--perhaps more important--than any other provision that exists in this large emergency supplemental requested by this President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress undoubtedly, at some point, in some way, will enact this legislation providing for some supplemental appropriations. When it does, in  my judgment, it must do more than just say thank you to veterans, as we do, but it must invest in veterans, which this new GI bill will do. This makes a lot of sense for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend especially those I have mentioned previously, including Senators Webb, Warner, Hagel, Murray, and so many others. I am proud to be one among them to say that this too is a priority for this country. I hope when the sun sets at the end of this week, if we have passed this legislation called the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, it will include something that ought to give all of us a reason to be proud and that it will include a new GI bill to say to veterans in this  country: You matter. It matters to us what you did for our country. I hope we manifest that by passing a new GI bill in the name of their service.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="ENERGY">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I know we are on the emergency supplemental bill. However, I want to talk a bit about the energy issue, so I will begin on that. I want to make a couple of points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we sent a bill that the President signed, I believe, this morning, which I offered here along with my colleague Senator Reid in the Senate last week. We passed it on Thursday. It said stop putting oil underground when oil prices are bouncing around at $128 a barrel or so. We told the Department of Energy stop putting 70,000 barrels a day underground. We have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve--which makes sense to me because if you run into trouble, you will have oil you have put away.  But we have put that oil away, and it is now 97 percent full. Yet the DOE and the Bush administration are topping it off by putting 70,000 barrels a day every day underground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation says stop that. When oil is going through the roof and the price of gasoline is so high, stop putting it underground. It makes no sense. You are putting upward pressure on prices, which is the last thing we should do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased the President signed the bill today. Some have said it won't make any difference, that there are factors other than the 70,000 barrels going underground that are at play here, and I will talk about them. But it certainly doesn't hurt to put additional oil, and therefore gasoline, into the supply pipeline. That ought to bring prices down. It is common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I used to teach a little economics and the supply/demand curve hasn't changed. If demand remains unchanged and supply is increased, prices are going to be lower. So I never understood why they decided when the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 97 percent full, why they are taking sweet light crude from the Gulf of Mexico and sticking it underground for a rainy day. It is raining at the gas pumps these days. Stop that and put it into the supply chain and put downward pressure on oil and gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that we finally did it last week. The House passed the bill. We got it to the President and he signed it. That is one step in the right direction. A big step, giant step? Probably not, but it is a step in the right direction in dealing with the question of the price of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is something curious going on in this country. It is not explainable, frankly. This chart says oil prices nearly doubled in 1 year--up, up, up, and up. They doubled in 1 year. What would cause that? Well, here is speculators' activity in the oil futures market. It looks like oil prices, doesn't it? It also goes up, up, and up. There is more and more speculation in the oil futures market. These are not people who want to buy oil--oh, no. They want to buy a contract. They don't ever  want to take delivery or get their hands dirty with oil; they want to speculate and gamble in the oil futures market. They want to buy what they will never get from people who never had it, and walk away grinning and deposit their money in the bank--big profits, by the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The senior vice president of ExxonMobil Oil, on April 1, last month, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of oil should be about $50 or $55 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is not. It is $128 a barrel, $129 a barrel today, and is headed north. So an oil company senior vice president said it ought to be $50 or $55 a barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clarence Cazalot, CEO, Marathon Oil, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is president of an oil company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, the Newark Star Ledger said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent, or more, to the price of a barrel of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fadel Gheit, 30 years with Oppenheimer Company, senior energy trader, said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I am absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It's open 24/7. Unfortunately, it is totally unregulated. This is like a highway with no cops and no speed limits, and everybody is going 120 miles an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Andrew Hall--I don't know him. I have said I would not know him from a cord of wood. All I know is that the Wall Street Journal reports this trader hit the jackpot on oil as the commodity boom roars on. When they say commodity boom, they are not talking about oil wells, or drilling rigs, or oil tanks; they are talking about the commodities market. Again, it is a market in which speculators abound--an orgy of speculation, with people buying things they will never get from people who never had  it, nobody wanting the oil, but wanting to speculate in this class called speculators. Mr. Hall earned a quarter of a billion dollars--$250 million--in 5 years. That is a pretty big payout, actually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these folks who are neck deep in futures markets include hedge funds, investment banks, unbelievable speculation in the futures market, which is driving up the price of gasoline and the price of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it is interesting to me, and I think important for us to understand, that as the price is going up, and it is going up again today, that more pressure will push prices higher. In this country, people will drive to the pumps tonight and try to figure out, how do I pay for this tank of gas? I need it and I have to drive to work. Or as the farmer tries to figure out, how do I fill that farm gas tank and pay for that? Or a small family trucking company tries to figure out how do I make ends  meet, or will I have to close the doors, perhaps, like one of the CEOs of the five airlines that have filed bankruptcy at this point because of fuel prices?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As all of this is happening, let me make a couple of points. One, we have more oil in our inventory and more fuel in our inventory right now than we did in January of this year. We are somewhere over 30 million to 40 million barrels of oil in inventory above where we were in January. So go figure. Inventory is up. Shouldn't prices come down a bit? You would think so. Not only is inventory up but demand is also down because our economy slowed down some, and because the price of gasoline and fuel  is very high, people are driving a bit less. Some estimate that demand has dipped around 4 or 5 percent. So our inventories are up, demand is down, and what is happening to oil prices? They are continuing to go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Refiners are actually refining less at the moment, by their own design, because they believe there is an excess of inventory, so they want to catch up a bit, or allow the inventory to catch up with demand. So they are refining less than they previously refined. You would think, then, if supply is up, with millions more barrels of oil in inventory, the supply of gasoline having increased sufficiently so that refiners are cutting back refining capability, that the price of gasoline and oil would  begin to come down. But it is not true. What is happening today is it is reaching record highs. So what does that tell  us? It tells us there is this unbelievable amount of speculation in which speculators have taken over the commodity markets and driven oil prices</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am telling you, at the top, take a look at the compensation of the top hedge fund managers in this country. It is unbelievable. It almost makes you ill. They are all making a lot of money, and they are doing it by speculating in a market that is driving up prices beyond where the fundamentals of oil and gas supply and demand would justify. There is no justification for this at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American families have a right to ask the question of this Congress: What on Earth are you going to do about it? Does anybody care? Or are the consumers just pawns in this big game while the speculators run off with all the money?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me, when markets don't work we have a responsibility to do something about it. If you have a computer handy, you can find a search engine and find excesses of speculation. In fact, over the last decade and a half, we have seen two bubbles already, and now a third. We saw the tech bubble, and it burst. We saw the housing bubble, and it burst. Now we see a bubble on the commodities exchanges, and it will burst at some point. The question is when and what damage will be done between  now and then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These exchanges are supposed to be regulating certain kinds of activities. I have a little experience in this--not a lot, but a little. I chaired the hearings in the Senate on Enron. We did it in a Commerce subcommittee. I had Ken Lay come in front of me in my committee. He raised his hand and swore an oath to tell the truth, sat down, and took the fifth amendment. We had Jeffrey Skilling come. He is now in prison. He wouldn't stop talking, by the way. Through it all, the suggestion was, there  is nothing going on here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was this unbelievable runup of wholesale electricity prices on the west coast during that period. We now know it was criminal activity, a criminal enterprise. We now know they were fixing things. They were shutting down plants. They were manipulating supply. They were speculating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not suggesting speculation is necessarily, or even in most cases, criminal behavior. It is not. But the combination, going back to Enron, of not being able to see the dark money, the money that moves in the shadows behind the regulatory opportunities that some agencies have, means consumers can be manipulated and injured dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lesson, it seems to me, as we take a look at what is happening in energy. I remember when President Bush came to town. He appointed a new Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I believe his name was Harvey Pitt. He said when he took office there is going to be a new attitude around here. This was the Securities and Exchange Commission, a regulatory body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: There is going to be a new attitude around here, a business-friendly attitude. And sure enough, it sure was business friendly, and not just there but virtually every agency. We don't want to regulate. Yes, we are a regulatory body, but we don't want to regulate. Yes, regulators are supposed to be the referees, wear the striped shirts, call the fouls; we don't want to do that. We don't even like Government very much. We just come here and say it is business friendly, so do what you want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 7 years we have seen an unbelievable amount of avarice and greed and speculation. Is it any wonder that we saw the bubble burst with respect to housing? Who wasn't minding the store? We know what happened then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had ads on television from these mortgage companies. Anybody who watched one of them would have known this doesn't work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ads said: Hey, you have been bankrupt, you can't pay your bills? Are you missing your house payments? Come over here. We will give you a new mortgage. You don't have to worry about all that. You have bad credit? Come to us. We will give you credit. In fact, we will give you a mortgage where you don't even have to pay all the interest. In fact, we will give you a mortgage loan where you don't have to pay any interest the first year; we will pay the interest for you, and the principal. We will  say to you: You don't even have to document your income to us. You have to pay a slightly higher interest rate, but you get a mortgage with us, and you don't even have to document your income. It is called a no doc loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, no documents, no interest payment for the first year and no principal payment for a long while. And by the way, when we set your interest rate, you pay an incredibly low interest rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I saw an advertisement that said pay one-fourth of 1 percent interest rate--not telling them, of course, it is going to reset at 10 percent in 3 years. They don't have a ghost of a chance of making those payments, and they are going to lose their house. We are sorry. They never tell them that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where were the regulators? Were they watching? No, they weren't watching. They didn't care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you have this buildup of speculation, mortgages, housing, and now the entire economy pays a price for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, we have this unbelievable buildup of speculation in the commodities market and oil, which is an essential commodity for every part of this economy, and the cost is going through the roof. Today it is setting a record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think of this economy and the national result. Does it matter that oil is different? Sure does. We suck 85 million barrels of oil out of this world every single day. We take 85 million barrels and suck it out of this planet. We need to use one-fourth of it in this country. We use 25 percent of all oil pulled out of this planet every day, and we only produce 10 percent. We use 25 percent of the world's oil, and we produce only 10 percent. That means we have to get a lot of it from elsewhere, and  we do. Mr. President, 60 percent plus comes from offshore, much of it from troubled parts of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a major issue with respect to oil. We have to deal with it. In the short term, though, we have to deal with this. John Maynard Keynes said in the long run, we are all dead. In the short run, we drive to the gas pumps and say: How can we possibly afford this? How can we pay this price? Then we understand this price isn't even justified. There is nothing in supply and demand that justifies this price. The supply is up, demand is down, and the price of oil is going through the roof. That  is not about market system. Those are arteries clogged in the free market system, and this Congress has a responsibility to do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do we do? There are a number of approaches a group of us are working on. It includes trying to find ways to make certain we know what is happening on all of these exchanges. The folks who run the exchanges in this country say: The problem is, if you increase the margin requirement, all this stuff is going to go to the Intercontinental Exchange, called ICE, over in London. You can't do that; it goes offshore and you never see it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is another part of the dark money strategy in this country where they all make money and injure this economy. We are looking for ways, and I believe we will find a way in a couple of days, to get our arms around this issue called regulatory need with respect to excess speculation on all markets. This is damaging this country's economy, and we cannot and should not stand for it. Speculators have had their day. They have made their money. They have injured this country. Now it is time for  us to wring that speculation out of those commodity markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need commodity exchanges. We need futures markets. We need them for liquidity. We need them for hedging. But when we have speculators grab these markets by the neck and pervert them, this Congress has a responsibility to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude by saying the price of oil is setting new records today despite the fact that we in this country have an increased supply of oil since January, month after month after month, and demand is going down by the consumer because of price. So supply is up,  demand is down, and this perversion in the marketplace is producing the highest price for oil we have seen. That is an unbelievable perversion of what the free market ought to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hear people say free market. There is no free market here. You have an OPEC cartel sitting behind closed doors. It would be illegal in this country. That does not contribute to a free market. That is a fixed market. And we have oil companies bigger and stronger. They almost all have two names now--ExxonMobile, ConocoPhillips--because they all merged and everybody thought that was fine, at least in this administration. So they are bigger and stronger and have more muscle in the marketplace.  Then we have this perversion in the futures market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That combination is a combination that I say damages this economy. We mean to address it. In the coming days, I intend to talk about legislation that will tie into this speculation, wring it out of the markets and say: You can't continue to damage the economy of this country; you can't continue to injure the consumers in this country because we are not going to stand for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am delighted to be an original cosponsor of the amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia which would clarify that the provisions in current law regarding the transferability of educational assistance benefits to family members would apply to the new GI bill for the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would further give the Department of Defense the ability to conduct a 2-year test of somewhat expanded transferability options to individuals who have completed 4 years of active duty service, who agree to complete an additional 6r years of service, and who meet such additional criteria as the Secretary of Defense establishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have consistently stated that I believe that transferability can be an important retention tool for the military and that the provisions of current law would apply to the provisions in <bill type="s" number="22">S. 22</bill> as revised. However, I have also noted that there is no data that demonstrate the retention value of the transferability option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army implemented a pilot program in July 2006 which allows soldiers who reenlist in critical skills to transfer their Montgomery GI bill benefits to their spouses. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that the Department of Defense annual report on entitlement transfers, dated March 20, 2008, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks so that Members can see that less than two percent of those who were offered the opportunity to transfer benefits took advantage  of that option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is on this basis that I believe that this authority needs to be continued and expanded slightly in the context of this new GI bill for the 21st century. But to rely on transferability solely or in lieu of the legislation that has been carefully developed by Senator Webb and others would be a mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Senate to approve the amendment offered by Senator Warner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, March 20, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This letter serves as the annual report on entitlement transfers of basic educational assistance to eligible dependents under the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) as required by Section 3020(1) of title 38, United States Code.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Army implemented a pilot program in July 2006, allowing Soldiers, who reenlist in critical skills, the ability to transfer MGIB benefits to their spouse. The Army defined critical skills as any Soldier who qualified for a Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) incentive and was entitled to a Zone B or Zone C bonus under current messages at the time of their reenlistment. This SRB is reduced by an amount equal to the actuarial per capita cost. These payments were then deposited into the DoD Education  Benefit Fund for transfer to the Department of Veterans Affairs.</narrative>
  <narrative>In Fiscal Year 2007, 296 Soldiers chose this option, or less than 2 percent of the over 17K Soldiers eligible upon reenlistment. Of the 296 Soldiers, the majority were mid-career Soldiers (SGT/SSG) assigned to U.S. Forces Command and U.S. Special Operations Command. Initial feedback from the field indicates that Soldiers want to be able to transfer benefits to all their dependents, including children. The Army extended the program to allow eligibility for both spouses and children in November  2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>None of the other Services exercised their MGIB transferability authority and, instead, relied on traditional reenlistment/retention incentives. In spite of the fact that this program was not offered by those Services, each experienced a successful retention year in Fiscal Year 2007. However, all the Services are closely watching the results of the Army pilot and continue to retain the authority to include MGIB transferability in their retention programs should circumstances warrant.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Department plans to include the expansion of MGIB transferability in its Fiscal Year 2009 legislative proposal. This expansion will support the President's State of the Union address, where he called for Congress to join him in "allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children."</narrative>
  <narrative>I trust that this report will prove useful in your consideration of Defense personnel programs. Similar letters have been sent to the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Armed Services, and the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Michael L. Dominguez,</narrative>
  <narrative>Madam President, I yield the floor.</narrative>
