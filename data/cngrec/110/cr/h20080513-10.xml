  <narrative>WE NEED TO PROTECT AMERICAN FAMILIES -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3409]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been 86 days since the Protect America Act expired, and the Democrat leadership refuses to bring a permanent extension to a vote. Our intelligence community has stated unequivocally that our ability to track and spy on potential enemies has been degraded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate passed a fair and commonsense extension to the Protect America Act months ago, and it has received vocal bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. That is why it is particularly disappointing that the Democrat leadership has failed to bring the bill to the floor. They refuse to do so because they know it will pass. For leadership to deny a vote on such an important piece of legislation, because they know it will pass, is an insult to the majority in this House who want to  defeat terrorists overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With each day, our intelligence community is being told to do their job without the tools and resources we can and should provide for them. This is unacceptable to keep American families at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
