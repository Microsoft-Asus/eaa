  <narrative>ELIMINATING INFECTIONS FROM MEDICAL DEVICES -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7662]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at least half of all cases of hospital-acquired infections are associated with medical devices. These medical devices include items ranging from tongue depressors to catheters and heart valves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These preventable infections infect 2 million patients per year and end up costing 90,000 lives and over $50 billion annually. These are unacceptable costs for patients, taxpayers and Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Up to this moment this morning, we already have over 1 million cases, you can see on this chart, 47,000 deaths and a cost of over $26 billion, and that's just as of today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday we passed the Medical Device User Fee Act which included an amendment in there that I placed in that allows for the government, the GAO, to study these issues. They note that even after rigorous cleaning and sterilization, virus and bacteria still exist on reused medical devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Manufacturers, providers and facilities should take measures to reduce the rate of infections. I urge my colleagues to refocus our Nation's health care system on patient choice, patient safety and patient quality and join me in working on these things together where we can save lives and save money for our Nation.</paragraph>
