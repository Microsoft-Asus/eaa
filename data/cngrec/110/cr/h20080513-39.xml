    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday, at 2:28 p.m. local time, a massive earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale struck Sichuan Province in southwest China. Tragically, the death toll is now estimated in excess of 12,000 people, and it may rise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are thousands of people injured and thousands more remain trapped beneath rubble. Especially tragic are the hundreds, and, perhaps over 1,000, school children who are trapped beneath their collapsed schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in observing a moment of silence to express our deep sympathy for those affected by yesterday's earthquake in China.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members will rise for a moment of silence.</chair>
