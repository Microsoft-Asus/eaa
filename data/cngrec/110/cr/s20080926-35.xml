  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today Senator ENSIGN and I have introduced a resolution designating October 16, 2008, Lights On Afterschool Day. Lights on Afterschool brings students, parents, educators, lawmakers, and community and business leaders together to celebrate afterschool programs. This year, more than 1 million Americans are expected to attend about 7,500 events designed to raise awareness and support for these much needed programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America today, 1 in 4 youth, more than 14 million children, go home alone after the school day ends. This includes more than 40,000 kindergartners and almost 4 million middle school students in grades six to eight. On the other hand, only 6.5 million children, or approximately 11 percent of school-aged children, participate in afterschool programs. An additional 15 million would participate if a quality program were available in their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool programs, is celebrated every October in communities nationwide to call attention to the importance of afterschool programs for America's children, families, and communities. Lights On Afterschool was launched in October 2000 with celebrations in more than 1,200 communities nationwide. The event has grown from 1,200 celebrations in 2001 to more than 7,500 today. This October, 1 million Americans will celebrate Lights On Afterschool!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quality afterschool programs should be available to children in all communities. These programs support working families and prevent kids from being both victims and perpetrators of violent crime. They also help parents in balancing work and home life. Quality afterschool programs help to engage students in their communities, and when students are engaged, they are more successful in their educational endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our work on the Senate Afterschool Caucus, Senator ENSIGN and I have been working for more than 4 years to impress upon our colleagues the importance of afterschool programming. It is our hope that they will join us on October 16 to celebrate the importance of afterschool programs in their communities back home.</paragraph>
