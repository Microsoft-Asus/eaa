    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his courtesy and for his cosponsorship of this initiative. I, obviously, want to also thank the sponsor of this legislation, with whom I am privileged to join, the Senator from North Dakota, who has demonstrated leadership for the last decade on this initiative which is so crucial to the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to speak today on behalf of the Dorgan-Snowe amendment regarding drug importation. I know the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, has offered a second-degree amendment to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services certify both the savings and safety of drug importation. Obviously, there is concern for the safety of the American people. It is one that I appreciate strongly. It must be our highest priority. But we have been at this juncture before with respect to drug  importation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned earlier, twice before we have seen the Congress adopt a requirement for the Secretary to certify safety and savings before implementing a program of prescription drug importation, and not a single prescription drug was imported under either the MEDS Act of 2000 or the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Americans deserve access to affordable medications, and that access must be safe, but  it is not made so by simply certifying with respect  to drug importation. As I said, twice before we have been through this--in 2000, and of course in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 under the prescription drug benefit for the Part D Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many who are in the Senate today supported a certification requirement in good faith, recognizing that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would certify the safety upon reviewing and evaluating circumstances, but that has not occurred. Most would not think such a certification would block Americans from legally importing medications. That is because for years we have seen our constituents--and certainly those from my State of Maine--using Canadian pharmacies, and both the safety and savings  were indisputable. Yet certification did not arrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary Shalala, declined to make the certification with respect to the MEDS Act, and we know she did so because of three specific flaws in the law, each of which this legislation addresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act, which included the prescription drug program, we saw that former Secretary Thompson could not certify importation. The fact is, it is patently unfair to ask the Secretary to make such a certification, especially as to safety. That is because you must give the Secretary the resources and the authority to implement measures to make prescription drugs and their distribution as safe as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it comes as no surprise that given no standards, no authority, and no resources, we have failed to see a Secretary provide certification over the last 7 years. Secretary Thompson understood this well. He said it simply:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The law is this: In order to import drugs from any country, and especially Canada, I have to certify that all those drugs are safe. That is an impossible thing. If Congress wants to import drugs, they should take that provision out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The certification of savings is no less of a red herring. In fact, it has become a persistent roadblock every time we have passed certification to allow drug importation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Without a doubt, Americans would not purchase imported medications if substantial savings were not being realized. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office has told us the countries from which we would import under this bill pay 35 to 55 percent less for brand prescription drugs and  that we can realize a drug savings alone of $50 billion over 10 years. It should be patently obvious the savings part of certifying importation is a nonissue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed those savings again, estimating that in addition to consumer savings, the Federal Government would save $10.6 billion--including the Medicare and Medicaid Programs that would achieve indisputable savings. Every cent of that savings, the CBO estimates, will be lost if the Cochran amendment is adopted because, as we all know, there would be no legal importation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The savings are clear. Yet the advocates of certification continue to insist certification is critical--particularly regarding safety. Yet what is needed is not a certification requirement, which simply is a stamp on the status quo, but real action to assure the safety of prescription drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By way of analogy, I would like to know where we would be if we applied this simple certification approach to other areas. Consider air travel. Americans embark on thousands of flights every day, but the travel of millions is not dependent on certifying the status quo. We rely on regulation and oversight of the aircraft that fly and their maintenance--of the individuals who crew, service, and direct those aircraft--of every critical aspect of aviation. If we were waiting for the FAA and its international  partners to simply say flying is safe rather than acting to make it safe, we simply wouldn't have commercial air travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that last week, as the Senate discussed problems with both the drug and food safety, I did not hear my colleagues suggest FDA certify that imported food is safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, instead, spoke about measures to make it so. That points to what this amendment is about--not ensuring safety but blocking fair access to imports for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, Americans simply cannot see why it is that they cannot be provided a safe and effective system, which is exactly what the Dorgan-Snowe amendment does and what this legislation has been drafted to accomplish year in and year out. We have taken every conceivable concern regarding safety and incorporated it in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see on this chart, we incorporate 31 provisions. Compare that to the Medicare Modernization Act, which included the Part D prescription drug program for seniors, that included only six safety-related provisions. We included 31 different provisions. That is crucial to understanding that this sets up a system that will allow FDA inspectors to approve registered prescription drugs imported from other countries--in fact, countries that meet or exceed our standards. Compare that, for example,  to the fact that the FDA approves manufacturing facilities in other countries that actually have lower standards than our country does. We allow medications to be manufactured in other countries with lower standards than what we have. Yet we are now saying we will not allow importations of medications from countries that meet or exceed our standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time in which American consumers are paying 35 to 55 percent more for drugs than foreign consumers--in fact, paying the highest prices in the world--this amounts to $99 billion more than the foreign consumers. That is what Americans pay today. Some would say: Oh, that affects research and development. Well, no, not exactly. In fact, the pharmaceutical industry spends about 10 percent of that $99 billion. So about $10 billion in research and development more than they do in Europe. So we  are not seeing the increase in prices that Americans pay being channeled into more research and development. It simply is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this does say is that American consumers are paying more than anyone else in the world. Not only are they paying more for their drugs, but American taxpayers are underwriting the research and development, as we have seen obviously with the National Institutes of Health. The taxpayer understands how important it is that the Federal Government remain on the vanguard of research and development of life-threatening medications, and not only are they paying for the research and development that  benefits foreign consumers, who are paying 35 to 55 percent less, but they are also paying the highest prices in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this legislation allowing for drug importation is so essential. We have addressed every safety concern. We create a regime for tracking the shipments, creating a pedigree, creating a history with FDA approval--inspected and registered. So I would urge the Members of the Senate to defeat this certification amendment and to support the Dorgan-Snowe amendment. I think we have achieved a milestone moment in the Senate, where we have finally recognized and acknowledged that the day has  come to allow Americans to take advantage of more competitive prices than have been available to them before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
