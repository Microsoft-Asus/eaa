    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to congratulate the Northern Kentucky University Norse women's basketball team for their victory in the NCAA 2008 Division II tournament. On March 29, women's basketball fans were treated to an exceptional game as Northern Kentucky University overcame a nine-point deficit, with 6 minutes remaining, to clinch its second national team title. The show-stopping 63-58 defeat over third-ranked North Dakota broke the Coyotes' 31-game winning streak. The Norse women's basketball team had  been strong all season, but was unranked going into the tournament. By winning 10 of their last 11 games, they were able to prove that they should indeed be considered number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to coach Nancy Winstel, who returned to her alma mater to lead the team to an impressive 28-8 record in her 25th season as head coach. Coach Winstel has been involved with the women's basketball program for 30 years at NKU, and reached the 500-win plateau as a college coach 3 years ago. Assistant coaches Matt Schmidt, Danielle Zimmerman, and strength and conditioning coach Livey Birkenhauer round out the coaching team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations are also in order for senior Angela Healy of Fort Thomas, Kentucky. Healy, a strong inside scorer and rebounder, was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. During the final game she produced a double-double, scoring 14 points and grabbing 13 rebounds, to lead her team to victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Northern Kentucky University women's basketball program is the only school in the State of Kentucky to win a national championship in a women's sport, and it now boasts two. The Norse women's basketball program is top notch, and the extraordinary achievement of this season is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the many  players, coaches, students, alumni, families, and fans that have cheered NKU along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning the national championship and finishing the season with a 28-8 overall record has brought national acclaim to Northern Kentucky University. I know the fans of the university will revel in this accomplishment as they look forward to next season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I once again congratulate Northern Kentucky University for their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1147, congratulating the Northern Kentucky University Norse women's basketball team, the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II tournament champions. How far women have come since the days that women basketball players were required to play half court only. I remember those days. This has really changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 29, 2008, and before a crowd of 3,067, the unranked Northern Kentucky Norse, from Highland Heights, Kentucky, put an end to the third-ranked University of South Dakota's Coyotes' 31-game win streak. NKU's women's basketball team used a 23-9 run to overcome a nine-point deficit and beat South Dakota 63-58 in the 2008 NCAA Division II national championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only 3 weeks earlier, NKU was just hoping to make it into the NCAA tournament. The Norse improved its NCAA chances by advancing to the Great Lakes Valley Conference finals, where it lost to Drury. Despite the loss, the team received a fourth seed in the Great Lakes regional. Earlier in the tournament, NKU had to overcome a 15-point deficit to win its first round games against Indianapolis, 55-54. The Norse then whipped Drury, 84-65, and edged Missouri S&amp;T, 60-52, on the path to the finals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NKU is led by one of the top coaches in the NCAA Division II women's basketball, Nancy Winstel. Currently in her 25th season as head coach at Northern Kentucky University, Coach Winstel reached the 500-win plateau 3 years ago. With this most recent championship, Coach Winstel has led NKU to two national titles, having earlier guided NKU to the 1999-2000 NCAA Division II national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should recognize Northern Kentucky University for embracing a regional stewardship role as reflected by its significant consideration to the intellectual, social, economic, cultural, and civic vitality of the region and the commonwealth. NKU supports multidimensional excellence across the full breadth of its work: Teaching and learning, research and creative activity, and outreach and public engagement. The university fosters a community that values openness, inclusion, and respect, and is  committed to intellectual and creative freedom and to the open expression of ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to the university's President, Dr. James Votruba; Athletic Director Jane Meier; Head Coach, Nancy Winstel, and her staff; and all of the hardworking the players, the fans, and to Northern Kentucky University. I am happy to be joined by my good friend and colleague, Representative Geoff Davis, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments, and wish all involved continued success. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there are no further speakers on the other side, I would yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
