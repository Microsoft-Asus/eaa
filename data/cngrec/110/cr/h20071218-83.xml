  <narrative>30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16820]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) is recognized for 60 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to be here before the House once again. And a lot has been done and I'm so glad that we're here and 30-something, once again, may be our last opportunity in this year of 2007. We appreciate the courage and the commitment by those of us that are in the majority. And we talked about a number of things that we would do and that has actually happened, Mr. Speaker. And a lot has happened this year, and, Mr. Speaker, I know that your constituents and  others as it relates to Minnesota and what has taken place there and the tragedies that y'all have dealt with and how this Congress has responded to that tragedy of the bridge falling, and so many of your constituents are in recovery as we speak, and being from south Florida, hurricane ravaged area, we know what recovery means. And it's important for us to respond in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I can tell you, some of my colleagues that were on the floor just prior to me hitting the floor talking about earmarks, it's very interesting. I am, you know, it's one of those days, and I'm glad that I was able to make it to the floor and that we were able to take this hour, and we want to thank the majority leader and also the Speaker and the majority whip and our leadership as it relates to the Democratic Caucus and our vice Chair for getting here, because to talk about earmarks, it's  very interesting because we've reduced earmarks by 40 percent. I mean, that is something that the Republicans did not do over a number of years. You wouldn't even know who put an earmark in if it wasn't for the transparency that the Democratic Congress brought to this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I'm going to tell you right now, I'm very happy that I was elected to come to Congress and that I'm going to get the opportunity to go home and tell my constituents what I've done for them in Congress. That's what it's all about. Why are we here representing 600, 700,000 individuals, Americans? To not only represent them here in Congress, but to also, quote, unquote, bring home the bacon on behalf of your constituency, to make sure that they have what they need, to make sure when a county  commissioner or someone that sits on a parish board has an opportunity to come to their Member of Congress and say we need something from the Federal Government, meanwhile back here in Washington, DC, we have Republicans that have voted in the last five, or four Congresses for tax breaks for billionaires. Their name's not attached to it. We come here, we bring transparency, we bring accountability. We bring accountability</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the Republicans, for years and years and years, have been able, Mr. Ryan, to give tax breaks to  the billionaires and gazillionaires. Here we are bringing government back to the people and being criticized by the other side of the aisle. So, Mr. Ryan, there's a lot that we have to talk about. This is a historic day. We passed energy independence and security act. That's a historic piece of legislation. And all our colleagues  have in the minority to talk about, earmarks that have been reduced by 40 percent and have been highlighted by this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing is there's like hundreds of people on the other side of the aisle who are taking earmarks, who feel like that it's better that they make the decision for their own district as to where the money should be spent or some bureaucrat in Washington makes the decision as to where the money is spent. Somebody's spending the money. Now, it's either the elected Representative who's going to spend the money or it's going to be someone here in DC who's going to spend the money and has no idea  of what the dynamics of the district are, what your long-term economic development plans are, what the health and safety welfare needs are of your district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it's best in a democracy for the elected Representative, who gets to have meetings in their office with different constituents, as to who will decide where this money is spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, is the autism center in Youngstown, Ohio, pork? I got three-hundred-and-some-thousand for that. Is the water line in a poor community to make sure that we have clean water, is that pork?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I love it when the Members from the western part of the country come to the House floor and talk about all this government spending. You know, in California, in Arizona, there are congressional districts that would not even exist if it wasn't for a Federal investment. There are congressional districts that they're in a desert. How do you think the water gets from the Colorado River to your congressional district? Through osmosis? No. There is Federal investment that is invested in these different  congressional districts, you know, the Colorado River Basin Project and all of these different projects that bring water to your district and your constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it is absolutely absurd for people to come to the House floor, and we've done exactly what we said we were going to do. We made this process transparent. There's nobody here that thinks you should be able to hide something. So now when you make an investment or you claim an earmark, your name goes on it, and it says Rich Center for Autism in Youngstown, Ohio, at Youngstown State University, Congressman TIM RYAN, 17th District.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Murphy was running for office a year and some change ago, talking about if he gets to Congress what he would do for his constituents, that he would provide the kind of representation that they deserve, turn this saga of Iraq and that other issue of Iraq back to domestic priorities, bring home the bacon on behalf of the district and his constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm so glad that he's here tonight because we've been here three times. This is his first time. I'm glad that he's here because I want to know what's wrong. I mean, I just, Mr. Speaker, I personally want to know what's wrong with coming to Washington, DC, representing your constituents, and doing what you said you would do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Fighting for kids with autism, fighting for teenage pregnancy programs, fighting for children's mental health, I mean, that's what's in these earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is the so-called pork spending that I'm bringing back to the Fifth District? For a children's mental health program in Danbury, for an after-school program in Torrington, for a teenage pregnancy center New Britain. You know why? Because the Republican Congress, along with this President, for the last 6 years and the last 12 years have gutted every single one of those programs that helps poor kids, helps poor families, helps the disabled, that helps poor, the disadvantaged, the dispossessed,  all of those programs that are just trying to give people a little bit of a leg up, trying to give them access to the apparatus of opportunity that all the rest of us have, were stolen out from underneath them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So guess what we're doing with these earmarks. We're going and funding basic social services to try to treat kids with autism, to try to cure children of a mental disease and mental disorder that they have. And we're forced to do that because we have been sitting through a Congress, and Mr. Ryan and Mr. Meek have been talking about it for several years, that has made a choice over the last several years, has made a choice to fund a whole bunch of tax cuts for people at the upper,  upper echelon of the income scale and at the expense of all the people that we are now putting first again, the folks that are supposed to be helped by government, that is, middle-class, regular folks who, through no fault of their own, might have had a little opportunity stolen from them. We're going to try to help them out again here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>The issue here is that the earmarks are a very small percentage of the Federal budget. All of these bills have been bipartisan. If you look at all of the appropriations bills that have passed out of the House, there has been a significant number of Republicans who have joined with the Democrats to make these investments, especially Members of the Appropriations Committee that have looked at these issues very carefully to make these investments in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy bill, of which our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, have derided us and it's a Democratic this and a Democratic that, 314 votes; 314 votes, which is 70 or 80 Republican Members of this body have joined with us to try to increase CAFE standards, make investments in alternative energy, make investments in the middle America and the Midwest. This is on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it seems like those folks who come to the floor seem to be on the fringe level of the party that they're talking about these things. But I think it's important for us to talk about some of the investments that we have made here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a significant shift in priorities. Now, we haven't come anywhere close to achieving what we have wanted to achieve since we have taken over. We don't have 60 votes in the Senate, and the Republicans have done a good job of blocking a lot of our legislation that we've tried to pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has vetoed SCHIP, which is the State Children's Health Insurance Program, that we wanted to provide 10 million middle-class kids with health care, and the President vetoed it twice. And the fringe Republicans, many have joined with us. RAY LAHOOD, STEVE LATOURETTE, a lot of good Members of Congress have joined with us to try to override that veto, but the President was able to sustain it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we asked to cover health care for 10 million kids, $35 billion over 5 years. President said we're spending too much money. Turned around within days and asked for $200 billion more for Iraq that we're going to borrow from China. And so some of the investments that we're trying to make, I think it's important for the American people to know what we have done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Tell them.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>We've raised the minimum wage for the first time since 1997. We've cut student loan interest rates in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, which will save and increase the Pell Grant by $1,000 over the next 4 or 5 years. We will save the average student or their parents, whoever's footing the bill, $4,400 over the course of their loan that they take out. Those are significant investments to the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to fix the AMT, which would come in and zap 23 or 24 million people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think it's important that we share with the American people, Mr. Speaker, the investments that we have made here, that are different than what the President wanted us to do, and we can go through this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But medical research, $607 million above the President's request. That's a lot of money, $607 million to research Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes. Now, I think the American people want us to work together to try to fund some basic research.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is one of these moments at the end  of the session, I mean we're like days from Christmas. We're still here in Washington, D.C. We've already started Hanukkah; Kwanzaa's on its way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's very, very important for us to point at the fact that this Congress has worked harder than any other Congress in the history of the Republic. I mean, I'm not talking about coming in number two or coming in number three or coming in number four, but we've taken more rollcall votes in the history of the Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's also very important, and I feel goose bumps by this whole thing. I pay attention to history. I also pay very close attention to the present. We're looking at a President right now that has made more veto threats than he's made in the last 5 years or 4 years, what have you, that he's been President of the United States to this Democratic Congress. We're looking at the AMT. We're talking about individuals being able to file their taxes, and we said that we were going to pay for it.  This President is saying that he doesn't want to pay for it, that he wants to borrow the money. But the bottom line is that we're going to be here to make sure that we pay for it in the long run, in the second half of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're not going to allow the President to play this Congress as a fiddle. This President is talking about, Oh, well, I want Iraq funding a part of the appropriations bill that's going to pass and all. He has the veto pen. He also has 40 Republicans here in this Chamber to make sure that we don't override him on this issue of Iraq. We voted for appropriations for Afghanistan, and we had a number of Republicans that voted against it, some 200-plus. I don't feel in any way bad about the position  that we've taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm so glad Mr. Manatos is on our side. You know, our colleagues who came to the floor right before our hour. I sent upstairs for this chart to make sure that we enter this chart into the Record one more time. I think it's important that we look at the 42 Presidents before this President were only able to borrow $1.01 trillion. We're talking about the Great Depression. We're talking about World War I. We're talking about World War II. We're talking about Korea. We're talking about Vietnam.  We're talking about Grenada; that's new. We're talking about a number of conflicts that have taken place. We're talking about economic downturns. We're talking about the S&amp;L scandal. We're talking about a number of issues that have faced Americans over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This President, President Bush, along with his Republican minority, thank God, but enough to be able to cause trouble over in the Senate with this 60-vote phenomena that we've learned about in this 110th Congress with Republicans saying, Well, you know, we're going to use procedural rules to be able to hold up what the Democratic Congress would like to do in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This President was able to borrow $1.19 trillion. That number is higher now. This chart is not updated, but I think it's important for our Democrats, Independents, Republicans to know that we believe in fiscal responsibility here on this floor. We believe in the American way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We used to talk about our children paying this bill, but now we're talking about we are paying this bill, countries like China and others.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>So I know Mr. Ryan is trying to get in the middle of this. He's always trying to get in the middle, and I'm just trying to make my point. I don't want you to take it personal. I'm just trying to make my point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you so very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's important, and I kind of feel like a Baptist preacher on the first Sunday. You want to be able to make your point, and you want to be able to climax, but Mr. Ryan comes in and gets in the way, but it's okay. He has a good point. He's a great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's important that we look at our responsibility right now and in the present for being able to stand up for those that have elected, woke up early one Tuesday for us, voting for representation, that we give voice to their cause and their need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's also important, especially as it relates to the diversity of our caucus, need it be Blue Dogs, need it be moderate, need it be to the left or whatever the case may be, it represents America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the reason why Republicans voted for Democrats last time, Independents voted for Democrats last time, Democrats voted for Democrats last time is because they're looking for change. We're here to provide that kind of change, but we start looking at obstructionists here in Congress using procedural, using the rules of the House, using the rules of the Senate. The minority is protected in this process, standing in the schoolhouse door, if I may use that, of allowing us to stop from the report  that we got today, November 13, or yesterday, November 13, total deaths in Iraq, 3,888; total numbers wounded in action and returned to duty, 15,832; total numbers wounded in action and not returning to duty, 12,829.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We pay attention to those numbers in the 30-something group because the American people are paying attention to those numbers, and I think it's very important, Mr. Speaker, that we continue to lift this issue up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we look at what we are facing right now, Members, there's nothing wrong with us representing our districts and being able to bring dollars back because this is something that has not happened over the years. We have been borrowing the money to be able to continue the war in Iraq. We have been borrowing the money as it relates to going after Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. We have been doing the things we need to do. But I think it's very important, Members, that we tell our story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today a very historic piece of legislation passed this floor when we look at the Energy Independence and Security Act. And I think we should not allow this day to pass without talking about the courage of Democrats and Republicans passing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to Mr. Altmire.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Before the gentleman gets into the energy bill, Mr. Speaker, and we do have a lot to talk about because that's an historic vote that is going to change this country in the long term for the better, I did want to follow up on what the gentleman talked about earlier and was finishing his remarks that about the legacy that this Congress over the past 6 years has left for our children and our grandchildren, the legacy of debt. And I want to take a little walk down memory lane, and we  have talked about this before, to think about what happened in the last 4 years of President Clinton's administration, where we had 4 consecutive years of budget surplus, a surplus that was forecast as far as the eye can see. In 10 years the estimated $5.5 trillion surplus, according to CBO, from 2001 through 2010, that was the estimated surplus dollars that we were going to have. And you will recall back in the 2000 election between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore, what was the debate? The debate was what are we going to do with this surplus? We had this enormous surplus, $5.5 trillion. Are we going to pay down the debt? Are we going to shore up Social Security? Are we going to do tax cuts? Are we going to create new programs? Everyone had an idea. You know what? We're not having that debate anymore because instead of having 10 years of budget surpluses, we have had 7 consecutive years of budget deficits,</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Altmire, I think you just hit a point there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan, the 30-something Working Group, I can say, gentlemen, that we do our homework. As we talked about our colleagues on the minority side criticizing earmarks on the majority side, Mr. Ryan, would you please share with our illustrious support staff that we have here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the reason why the 30-something group exists, so that we can, some may say, push back. We say tell the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to Mr. Ryan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, it's interesting that one of the gentlemen, Mr. Speaker, that was down here complaining about earmarks just minutes ago prior to our getting down here, and we are not here to play gotcha but we are here to reveal what has happened here, in this bill loaded with earmarks, loaded with all this pork, one of the gentlemen down here, Mr. Speaker, had requested 20 earmarks worth $38 million but turns around and comes to the House floor and is critical of the Rich Center for  Autism in Youngstown and dam safety projects and after-school programs and some of the other districts that are here and calling it pork and in one of the instances was trying to in some way disparage the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) in his project that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So our point is not to play gotcha. Our point is to say that Members of Congress should be able to direct a certain amount, and it's only a small percentage of the budget. I don't even know if it's .5 percent of the entire budget.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Bill Thomas that used to be the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>So I think it's important, Mr. Speaker, for us to note that that's the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Ryan, I am going to kick it back to you and Mr. Murphy was very kind because it was his turn, but I am going to tell you Mr. Thomas ran the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Altmire, and meanwhile had something named after him. And for Members on the minority side to come to the floor and talk about present Members that are bringing home the resources on behalf of their constituents, I can see if one did not put in a request.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will yield, Mr. Ryan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have got more here. The gentleman from California, the previous gentleman, who just made fun of us for all the earmarks, had 20 earmarks worth $38 million and is supporting one now named after the former Chair of the Ways and Means Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another gentleman down here that was from Michigan got press releases, and you will love this one, $3 million for an extended cold weather clothing system through the Army. He was just down here making fun of everybody, and he's requesting thermal underwear. And it's not funny because the reason we are here is to make sure that we are getting this all out. And for Members of Congress to come question the Rich Center for Autism. And I know Mr. Altmire has a lot of issues. We have all  got issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the point is to make your case. If you want money for thermal underwear, come down and make your case in front of your colleagues. If you want money for autism, make your case. But the fact is you can't come down here and hold everyone else on one side of the aisle to a standard that you're not willing to hold yourselves to. It's a simple request here, Mr. Ryan, to be consistent. If you're going to be against earmarks, then be against them. But  if you are going to make the case that there's waste and pork in the bill, sometimes you've got to look inward.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, Mr. Altmire, I want to thank you first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me just say this: let me tell you, as I was walking to the Chamber, I saw that the Speaker's vehicle was still here in the Capitol. I saw that the majority leader's vehicle was still here at the Capitol. This is now a little bit before 10 p.m. within the closing days of Congress. We have worked day in and day out. We are here away from our families, many of you away from your families, days before Christmas, to be able to work on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's important for us to understand that we would not even be having the discussion about who got what if it wasn't for the transparency that this Democratic Congress brought to this process first. So for Republicans to come to the floor and start talking about who got what, it never would have happened, Mr. Murphy, if it wasn't for what we have done. It never would have happened if it wasn't for your class and Mr. Altmire's class coming and saying we want transparency,  that we want the American people to see what we are doing, that we want to take more rollcall votes than any other Congress in the history of the United States. We want ethics; we want responsibility; we want fiscal responsibility; we want to make sure that the Veterans Affairs get more money than they have ever had in history, the veterans health care system, in the history of the Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want accountability as it relates to Iraq, and we want this President to know that this is not a rubber-stamp Congress. If it was not for you, Mr. Speaker, including yourself, asking for the kind of accountability the American people have been calling for, that have been yearning for, voting for and they finally got it, for the minority party to come to the floor and start criticizing things, where they make over 20-plus earmarks, to come to the floor and criticize, that's why I'm so glad,  Tom and Tasha and Michael, that we are here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to make sure that we set the record straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked about the hypocrisy of the democracy. This is a perfect example of what happens when things go unchecked. I am so glad that we exist. I'm so glad we have air within our bodies to be able to come to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to Mr. Altmire.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman allowing me to speak out of turn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the high order of being asked to do the Speaker pro tempore duties beginning in a few minutes here, and I do greatly appreciate our friend and colleague, Mr. Ellison from Minnesota, for covering for me while I give these remarks, and then I am going to take the chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman hit it right on the head. We would not be having this discussion were it not for this Congress on the very first day we were in session adding transparency to the earmark process. In the past we couldn't have this discussion because earmarks were put in in the dark of night. Earmarks were not identified by sponsor. Earmarks were put in at each stage of the process unidentified. You didn't know where they came from. You didn't know the details of the earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we are able to have a discussion, and every Member of Congress who has an earmark in the bill that we are going to pass this week and send to the President has the responsibility to justify those earmarks. And if the gentleman wants to justify his earmark for cold weather clothing, he's able to do so.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Altmire, let me just clarify what you're saying. In the past if somebody had come down to this floor and had spent an hour railing against the massive amount of earmarks in the bill, we wouldn't know that that person had requested some 20-odd earmarks in the bill. We wouldn't know unless we had these rules in place.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is absolutely correct. And you wouldn't be able to look at the final product, at the bill, and look at every single earmark in there. I think they said there were 9,000 earmarks in the omnibus bill that we were passing today compared to 16,000 total earmarks that were in the last Republican budget that was passed. I believe that was fiscal year 2006. And I am going to talk about why fiscal year  2007 didn't have any earmarks. But fiscal  year 2006 had 16,000 earmarks unidentified. We couldn't have this discussion. We couldn't come to the floor and talk about who put in these earmarks, who has to justify the merits of those earmarks. But we can have that discussion today because this Congress, on the very first day</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am more than willing to justify the money that I am sending back to my district to help stimulate the economy and create jobs in western Pennsylvania. I would assume that the speakers who came before us are willing to justify their earmarks in there. But don't come down to the floor and lecture us on whether or not there should be earmarks in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if the gentleman would just allow me to finish, because I do have to take the chair, and again I thank Mr. Ellison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In FY 2007, I think I said 2005 and 2006, FY 2007, the Republicans who controlled this House at the end of 2006 were unable to complete their work on nine of the 11 appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we heard some rhetoric in the group that came before us, and we've heard for the past several weeks, even months, about how we are not doing our duty because we're putting all these bills into an omnibus bill and sending it to the President before the end of the year. I want to take a walk down memory lane on this, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the other first votes that Mr. Murphy, Mr. Ellison and myself took, our freshman class, was resolving those nine appropriation bills from last year that the Congress left to us. And that happened because after the elections that Congress said, You know what? We're taking our ball and going home. Forget it. We're not going to complete these nine bills. We're going to leave it for the next Congress. And that next Congress was this Congress. It was the Democratic-controlled  Congress. And we finished all nine appropriations bills in a month. And those nine appropriations bills funding us right now, the current operations of the government, contain no earmarks, zero. So we went from 16,000 earmarks the year before last to zero for those nine of 11 appropriations bills that we have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, yes, the omnibus bill that we are passing this week does contain earmarks, but let's not forget the fact that the current year's budget, which we passed in this Congress, had no earmarks. And we were stuck with that right from the start, specifically because the previous Congress failed their job and left it for us to resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at this point, I will yield to the gentleman from Connecticut.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Altmire, let me just take a quick guess, let me throw a hypothesis out there about why folks on the other side of the aisle and those that were talking tonight might be a little angry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone gets passionate down here, but when Mr. Meeks talks, it's kind of like happy passionate. On the other side of the aisle it feels a little different. And listen, I would be too, I guess. And this is my guess, I would be, too, if I had spent decades building up a brand of my political party based around fiscal responsibility, and then, in the course of 1 year, in the course of 1 year the party that you tried to portray as the tax and spenders, the fiscal irresponsibles, that party,  after having been in control of the Congress for less than a year, for the first time in 12 years does all of the fiscally responsible things that you couldn't do, passes a rule saying that every single bill that comes before this Congress has to be paid for. You can't pass anything on this floor that expands the deficit. First</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I guess I would be angry, too, if I was a Republican in this House and I looked at the party that I thought I joined, which was the fiscally responsible party, and found out that that mantle now lay on the other side of the aisle. So, that might explain something, Mr. Ryan. And I guess knowing that, maybe a little bit of it is justifiable.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>You know, obviously there have been situations decades ago where, you know, everyone was spending too much money. And for us to put in the PAYGO rules that say you've got to pay for every dime you spend one way or the other I think is a significant step in the right direction. Nobody here wants to continue what has happened over the last 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when you look at what's happened, over $3 trillion in debt has been borrowed from China, Japan and OPEC countries. Our friends on the other side, when they were in charge, raised the debt limit five times in order to go out and borrow more money. And we see the situation that we're in now. So we're trying to, slowly but surely, rein all of this in and make very strategic investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would say, Mr. Speaker, that you can go to the Web sites for the Speaker and our caucus and what we're doing. We're making investments into alternative energy, research and development, so we can open up new sectors of the economy. We're making investments in education, saving the average family who takes out loans and utilizes the Pell Grants $4,400 over the course of that loan. That's a middle-class tax cut. What we're going to do with the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, we're going  to prevent 23 million people from getting a tax increase next year. And that's a middle-class tax cut. These are people making $50,000 to $75,000 a year. We're going to prevent that from happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Significant steps in criminal justice. Cops on the beat. In communities like Youngstown, Ohio, the city doesn't have the tax base to keep hiring more and more cops, so it's harder to develop your economy if you don't have security. So, these are the kinds of investments that we're making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in closing, as we wrap things up, because I think we're going to wrap things up here in a minute, first, Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit these two articles for the Record so that not only are these earmarks represented openly, as our rules have provided, but there are also press releases that some of our Members on the other side who have been on the floor detesting earmarks, their press releases can now be submitted for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[From the Bakersfield Californian, July 11, 2007]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Get an Eyeful of Earmarks</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earmark--a.k.a. "pork barrel"--spending has almost as dirty a reputation as its porcine namesake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earmarks are items from a pot of money--$29 billion in 2006--from the $2.4 trillion federal budget that is set aside from the complex federal appropriation process for congressmen to dole out for specific projects in their districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two problems with earmarks:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some ideas are silly, flag-waving expenditures with little widespread redeeming value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good or bad, finding out what the money is for and who the patron congress member is can be a nearly impossible task for the public until it is too late to change the spending outcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That could be changing, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, may be among the 34 of 435 members of Congress who voluntarily released his list of requests in time for the public to comment. Rep. Jim Costa, D-Fresno, has not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early disclosure is the key element to any credibility claim. With that in mind, why wouldn't everyone list their proposed earmarks the way McCarthy has done?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>See the first bulleted item above. A good project gains stature, but a stinker may, like Dracula, die a deserved death when the light of day shines on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, disclosure has the potential benefit of increasing the quality--and hence the justification--of earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But can earmarks be justified at all?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes. The federal budget process tends to look at the big picture--after all, it is measured in trillions of dollars. An earmark can focus on a small, highly localized need that is easily overlooked in vast appropriation measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>McCarthy requested 20 earmarks worth $38 million for the 22nd district (Kern and San Luis Obispo counties) and another $142 million for Edwards Air Force Base and China Lake Naval Air Weapons Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He may not get any funds, but some examples include $122,000 to help the Bakersfield Police Department deter gang violence; $7 million for the Lake Isabella Dam safety  project; $500,000 for Cal State Bakersfield to help nursing education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A classic example is the Thomas Road Improvement Program now under way. In his final year in office, McCarthy's predecessor, Rep. Bill Thomas, provided desperately needed highway funding that otherwise would have been sucked up by politically powerful Southern California and Bay Area jurisdictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether an earmark is good or bad is up to the individual voter. But at least now you know what is being requested. (A full list of McCarthy's requests was published in the July 1 Californian.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walberg Secures House Approval of Funding for Biological Weapons Prevention</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WASHINGTON, August 16.--U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI) announced today that 2008 funding for Dexter Research Center, Inc. was approved in the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill that recently passed the House. The bill will now go to the U.S. Senate to be voted on as part of the fiscal year 2008 Appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Department of Defense must have the capability to respond to chemical and biological attacks, and this important project will increase the safety and security of our men and women in uniform," Walberg said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this funding, the Michigan company will help develop a Total Perimeter Surveillance (TPS) system based on infrared technology able to identify and trigger an immediate response to chemical and biological attacks against Department of Defense facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We are excited to have this opportunity to leverage our science and manufacturing capabilities to help make our national defense sites even more secure," said Robert Toth, Jr., President of Dexter Research Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding details:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dexter Research Center, Inc. (Washtenaw County) $2,000,000--This project funding will go towards assisting in the development of a Total Perimeter Surveillance (TPS) system capable of identifying and responding to chemical and biological attacks. The TPS solution, based on novel infrared technology, can provide complete perimeter threat detection and identification with sufficient advanced warning to Department of Defense facilities to meet current threat requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walberg Secures House Approval of Funding for Sonobuoys</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WASHINGTON, August 13.--U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI) announced today that 2008 funding for sonobuoys, produced by Sparton Electronics of Jackson, was approved in the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill that recently passed the House. The bill will now go to the U.S. Senate to be voted on as part of the fiscal year 2008 Appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Funding for sonobuoys, produced by Sparton Electronics, is important for the security of our naval personnel and Jackson County," Walberg said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding details:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sparton Electronics, (Jackson County) $2,500,000 increase--This project funding will go towards procurement of sonobuoys for the Department of the Navy. The sonobuoy remains the Navy's primary sensor for detection and localization of submarines by air anti-submarine warfare (ASW) platforms. Sonobuoys provide the only means to rapidly sanitize large areas of water prior to fleet units arriving in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walberg Secures House Approval of Funding for Peckham Industries Products Used by Military</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WASHINGTON, August 17.--U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI) announced today that 2008 funding for Peckham Industries was approved in the Departments of Defense Appropriations Bill that recently passed the House. The bill will now go to the U.S. Senate to be voted on as part of the fiscal year 2008 Appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peckham produces Fleece Insulating Liners, a Cold Weather Layering System and a Multi Climate Protection System all used by United States military personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"These three projects greatly benefit our brave men and women in uniform and Eaton County," Walberg said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It's a privilege to provide our soldiers with the equipment they need," Peckham CEO/President Mitchell Tomlinson said. "These contracts represent much needed jobs and opportunities created for persons with disabilities. We're proud to continue providing the highest quality, high performance cold weather gear available to our military."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding details:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peckham Industries, $3,000,000--This project will go towards the production of Insulating Liners for Extended Cold Weather Clothing System for the Department of the Army. This product was created in direct response to soldiers' complaints of bulkiness and lack of breathability in previous attire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peckham Industries, $3,000,000--This project will go towards the production of a Cold Weather Layering System for the United States Marine Corps. The CWLS is part of the Marine Corps' Mountain and Cold Weather Clothing and Equipment Program, which provides lightweight, durable combat clothing that allows Marines to operate in all kinds of cold weather environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peckham Industries, $2,500,000--This project will go towards the production of a Multi Climate Protection System (MCPS) for the Department of the Navy. The MCPS is a modular ensemble that provides total performance by layering thermal protection and shell garments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would just like to say, go to our Web site. Look at what we've done for K-12, student aid, rural development, the farm bill. All of the things that we've passed out of here have been investments, actually met the President's budget numbers, so it's just a shift in priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I'm saying I think we've made significant progress this year, and we hope to expand it next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Mr. Meek, I yield back to you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Ryan, I want to thank you and Mr. Altmire, and also Mr. Murphy and Ms. Wasserman Schultz and others who have been very active in our 30-Something over the year. I want to thank those that are involved in preparing not only material that we meet on on a weekly basis, but also what we bring to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank all of the staff and those that are involved, the Speaker's office, the majority leader and the whip's office, the majority whip and the Democratic leader, and also the Vice Chair for everything you do to make our 30-Something hour possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know if we'll have the opportunity to come to the floor tomorrow, which some project may be our last night on the floor, but we want to thank Mr. Michael and also Mr. Tom, Ms. Natasha and Mr. Adam and so many others that have spent time on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot done this Congress. We're going to be talking about it more. And like Mr. Ryan said, go onto www.speaker.gov to get information on 30-Something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend those Members of the minority party that voted with the majority party to be able to make it so for many of the things that Mr. Ryan has talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to the President's State of the Union that will be coming up in January. Many of, I'm pretty sure, his talking points will come from what has already been accomplished by this Democratic Congress or has been brought to the President by force because of the vote that we have here and the will of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that this is the holiday time of the year, and we would like to also recognize not only the contributions of our religious communities out there, but also those that work within our charities that have made it so for those to be able to not only have warm meals, but also to have gifts at this time of year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also recognizing those Members that served in the first half of this Congress that did not make it to the second half of this Congress, those Members of this House and also the Senate that have moved on to a higher place. We ask for blessings for their families, and also for their loved ones that have been left behind. We try to provide the kind of representation that they tried to put forth on the Democratic and also the Republican side of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful, and all of us in the 30-Something are very grateful for coming to the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Meek, if you would yield for just a moment. I just wanted, on behalf of Mr. Altmire, who sits in the Speaker's chair today, to just thank you and Mr. Ryan for allowing two new guys into the 30-Something. This has been just a wonderful year for us, made even more wonderful by being able to be closer to the good graces and large brains of both you and Mr. Ryan. So, I mean that sincerely, by the way. You did not have to open up the  30-Something Group to both Mr. Altmire and myself and some of the others that have had the opportunity to come down and be part of these discussions that we've watched on TV for years before we came here. And I would like to extend our thanks to you and Mr. Ryan and Ms. Wasserman Schultz.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Murphy, we definitely appreciate it. And I'm going to take that part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record and put it in the foyer of my office here in Washington, also the large brains part, put it in the foyer. But if it wasn't for the support of our leadership allowing us to come to the floor. But also, I think, Mr. Speaker, those individuals that are in harm's way and their families, two wars going on, we appreciate their contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate those veterans, since we're giving what we call "shout- outs," giving those veterans that allow us to salute one flag, we appreciate them, those folks that put it on the line and some that did not make it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we look forward to coming back in the second half of this Congress and finish the unfinished business. We want the American people to have faith in this House, have faith in this Senate, and also a level of respect for the Commander in Chief, that we're going to work this thing out here in Washington, D.C., on behalf of those that have sent us up here to represent them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to the second half of the Congress. I want to thank the staff, thank the folks in the Clerk's office for doing all that they've done, even the staff over in the minority office for sticking in there over many hours in this first half, because we have not only made history, but we have also put in more hours than any other Congress in the history of the Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, we encourage people to go to www.speaker.gov, and we yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
