  <narrative>THE BROADCASTER FREEDOM ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9188]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that the so-called Fairness Doctrine was rescinded by the FCC nearly 20 years ago, some of the most powerful voices in Congress are calling for a return of this outright censorship of the broadcast airwaves of America. In response, we introduced the Broadcaster Freedom Act, legislation that would ensure that no future President could return to the Fairness Doctrine without an act of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, that more than 140 Members of Congress have cosponsored this legislation to date. Last week, the current chairman of the FCC wrote to say that there was "no compelling reason to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine." Its predecessor from 20 years hence said that reimposing the Fairness Doctrine would be a "colossal mistake."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's say yes to the freedom of the press. Let's say yes to the freedom of the American people to choose when and how and where they get their information on government. I urge all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to join me in cosponsoring the Broadcaster Freedom Act this week.</paragraph>
