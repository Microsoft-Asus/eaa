  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>I, too, welcome Roger Wicker to the Senate. I have known him a long time. He has been a leader for the Tennessee Valley Authority. He is one of Congress's most knowledgeable Members, and he has been a leader in helping to put American history back in its rightful place in our classrooms so our children can grow up learning what it means to be an American. He was the lead sponsor in the House of Representatives on legislation that I introduced in the Senate that  created summer academies for outstanding teachers and students of American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to congratulate Marty Paone on his service here. We all admire him and will miss him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the majority leader for his remarks at the beginning of the year, and I especially wanted to echo the remarks the Republican leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, made. He pointed out that we have had a Presidential election in this country every 4 years since 1788. Senator McConnell pointed that out, and he said we would not use this year's election as an excuse to put off the people's business for another day. In other words, it is a Presidential year, and some around  town are writing and saying: Well, they will not get much done in Congress this year. We are saying on the Republican side of the aisle, and I hope it is being said on</paragraph>
    <paragraph>both sides of the aisle, that there is no excuse for Congress to take a year off, given the serious issues facing our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of politicians are campaigning for change, we have all heard. Republican Senators are ready to help, working with our colleagues, to give the Senate an opportunity to vote for real change. We wish to change the way Washington does business by going to work on big issues facing our country. And not just go to work on them but to get principled solutions this year. And because this is the Senate, where it often takes 60 votes to get a meaningful result, that means we invite the Democrats  to work with us in a bipartisan way to get those results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans didn't seek our offices to do bad things to Democrats. We are here to do good things for our country, and there is plenty to do. We see what is happening in the housing market, with oil prices, with rising health care costs. We know we need to move quickly with a bipartisan approach to help get the economy back on track. Our preference is to let businesses and people keep and spend more of their own money to boost the economy. We want to grow the economy, not the Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know we need, as Senator Kyl was saying, to intercept communications among terrorists to protect our country. We saw the Rockefeller-Bond bipartisan proposal passed by 13 to 2 in the Intelligence Committee. Our solution is to make sure companies aren't penalized for helping us protect ourselves, while at the same time securing individual rights. We want a strong national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see there are 40 million or so Americans uninsured, and we want to change that. We don't want to take a year off in dealing with health insurance. We want to start this year. As the Republican leader said, our goal is that every American have health insurance, starting with small business health insurance plans, moving on to reforming the Tax Code so Americans can afford to buy private insurance. There are a number of Democratic and Republican proposals on reaching the goal we have in helping  every American to have health insurance. We can start this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no need to wait to deal with Medicaid and Medicare spending another year. We all know, at their present pace of growth, those two accounts will bankrupt our Government. It is irresponsible to wait. That is a bipartisan conclusion. There are a number of proposals from both sides of the aisle to begin to deal with that, from Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad, to Senator Feinstein and Senator Domenici and Senator Voinovich as well. We should get  started. These are the principles of fiscal responsibility and limited Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, we took some important steps to keep jobs from going overseas by growing more jobs at home. We see the problem of competition with China and India. We worked together to pass a bill--the American COMPETES Act--authorizing $34 billion to keep our brainpower advantage. Now let us implement it. Senator Hutchison of Texas, Senators Bingaman and Domenici of New Mexico, and many others have worked hard on this. So let us implement more advanced placement courses  for low-income students, a million and a half more; more highly trained scientists and engineers coming in to help grow jobs in the United States; and 10,000 more math and science teachers. That we can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know we have to be bipartisan to get a result. Some things are bipartisan, and I have mentioned many of them, but some things should be bipartisan that aren't. For example, the Federal Government is saying the Salvation Army can't require its employees to speak English on the job. Well, Americans, by 80 to 17 percent, believe employers should be able to require their employees to speak America's common language on the job. We have legislation to make that clear. It is bipartisan to some degree,  but not as bipartisan as it ought to be. The principle is right there above the Senate Presiding Officer's desk. It says: One from many--"e pluribus unum."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another challenge that should be more bipartisan, because most Americans see the wisdom of it, is addressing a shortage of medical care in rural America caused by lawsuit abuse. OB-GYN doctors are abandoning rural areas across America and mothers are driving too far for prenatal health care and to have their babies. We should work across party lines to change that. The solution we have offered is to stop runaway lawsuits that make doctors pay $100,000 or more a year for malpractice insurance.  That is why they leave the rural areas. This is the principle of equal opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is plenty of work to do. Thirty years ago, I began my service as the Governor of Tennessee. I was a young Republican Governor and the State was very Democratic, thank you. So the media ran up to the big Democratic speaker of the house, Ned McWherter, and said: Mr. Speaker, what are you going to do with this new young Republican Governor? And to their surprise, the speaker said: I am going to help him. Because if he succeeds, our State succeeds. And that is the way we worked for 8 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we are not naive about politics in Tennessee. We had, and have, our fights. We argued about our principles. If I had a better schools program, they had an even better schools program on the other side. But we kept our eye on the ball. In the end, we worked together. In the end, we got results. That is why we brought in the auto industry and created the best four-lane highway system and created chairs and centers of excellence at our universities that still exist, and we began to pay teachers  more for teaching well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like nothing more than to move that kind of cooperation from Tennessee to DC. I sense that from Democrats and Republicans all through this body. Of course, we will argue. We were elected because we have differences. This is a debating society. But we don't stop with our disagreements, we should finish with our results. So we are here to change the way Washington does business, as the Republican leader said, and I look forward to a constructive year of helping our country move ahead with  a steady  stream of specific solutions to big problems that get results because they either are bipartisan or because they should be bipartisan.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to join my distinguished colleague from Tennessee who recently was elected to the leadership on this side of the aisle. His responsibility and mine is to help try to find a way to work together, not by sacrificing our principles but to try to find that common ground rather than what divides us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But first let me also express my congratulations to our new colleague from Mississippi, Senator Wicker, who had a distinguished career in the House of Representatives and comes here, I know, with a lot of hopes and aspirations. I look forward to working with him as he represents his State and as I represent my State, the State of Texas, and as we all work together to represent the United States, hopefully, to provide for the aspirations and dreams of the American people to make it possible  for them to live their dream. That is what the United States has always been; that is what it should remain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot help but reflect, returning from our holiday recess, I had somebody this morning in the cafeteria say: Welcome back from your vacation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: Well, I prefer to call it the alternate work period because it was not entirely a vacation, although I did get some time off, as did my colleagues. But I trust that we all came back refreshed and rejuvenated and ready to take on the challenging work that lies ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say, if I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times as I traveled the State of Texas, people are frustrated with Washington, DC. They think Washington is broken. They do not hear about those occasions when we work together to pass legislation on a bipartisan basis. They hear the conflict and the divisiveness and the partisanship, and they do not like it. I had to tell them, each of my constituents when they mentioned that: Well, I do not like it very much either. I did not run for  the Senate and I do not serve in a position of public trust to come up and pick fights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody knows in politics it is always possible to pick a fight, but it does not take any particular genius to do that. What we ought to be doing, and what it takes hard work to do, is trying to find common ground. There is plenty of common ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Alexander mentioned a number of tremendous bipartisan accomplishments--the America Competes Act. There have been a number of opportunities for us to work together in a bipartisan way. I am particularly proud of some legislation that Senator Pat Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I were the cosponsors of that the President signed into law in December, the first reform of the Freedom of Information Act in perhaps as much as 25 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think perhaps the best anecdote to public skepticism about Washington is greater transparency because I believe giving the public information about how their Government works is a way to empower them to hold elected officials and Government accountable. When things happen in secret, behind closed doors, that does not happen. So I am delighted there are plenty of opportunities for us to work together. I think we should embrace them, not run away from them or look for opportunities for us to  pick fights and to feed that skepticism and really the sense that I think many people expressed to me that they feel as though Washington is increasingly irrelevant when it comes to dealing with the challenges that affect our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The economy is one that has, of course, come roaring to the forefront as an issue on which we need to work together. I was pleased to hear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid say they wanted to work with the President to come up with a stimulus package that is timely, targeted, and temporary, something that would hopefully get the economy moving again as it has been for roughly the last 4 years, where we have seen an unbroken record of growth of the economy, increased number  of jobs, some 9 million new jobs created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, the way that happened is because we allowed the American taxpayer and small businesses to keep more of what they earned so they could invest it, they could spend it on the education for their children, they could do whatever they wanted to with it because it is theirs. Sometimes I think it is helpful to remind ourselves that the money that hard-working Americans earn is their money. It is not ours. It is not the Federal Government's money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes I think when people are in Washington too long they begin to think of this as revenue pay-fors, ways to raise funds so that Government can grow bigger and spend people's money. Well, the American people understand there are some things they cannot do for themselves and Government has to do, such as the common defense, and they are willing to pay their taxes for efficient Government that delivers a particular result that Government only can provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we ought not to use this stimulus package, the downturn in the economy, as a way to burden the American  people with more taxes or find new ways to grow the size of the Federal Government. So I hope we can continue in a careful and judicious and thoughtful way to find common ground to work on a stimulus package that the President will sign and that will enjoy bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is a lot of skepticism, as I said, about Washington. Part of it is that the Government does not spend the tax dollars well, efficiently. I have to tell you there is good evidence of that. There is a Web site associated with the Office of Management and Budget called expectmore.gov. I hope people will look at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I discovered when I looked at it is that the Office of Management and Budget has reviewed 1,000 different Federal Government programs and found 22 percent of them either ineffective or the Office of Management and Budget cannot tell whether they are serving their intended purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not sure which is worse. Either they are proven ineffective or else you cannot tell. Either way that is unacceptable and we need to find a way to deal with those wasteful Washington programs that need to be eliminated. I proposed a Federal sunset commission that is modeled after many of the States, such as my State, the State of Texas, where you have periodic reviews of those programs, and every once in a while the bureaucrats have to come in and justify the reason for the program's existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If circumstances have changed, the program is no longer needed, it can be eliminated or the budget, rather than securing an inflationary or cost-of-living increase in the size of that program each year without any real scrutiny or oversight, they start out with a zero-based budget and have to justify each dollar of that budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think a national sunset commission would help us eliminate more wasteful Washington spending. As I said, I am proud of the work that Senator Leahy and I were able to do in a bipartisan way to reform the Freedom of Information Act to give people more information about their Government so they can hold Government and Government officials accountable. But I think there is more that we need to do. Recently, earlier this month, the Government launched a new Web site called www.usaspending.gov  which allows Americans to search for Federal grants and contracts. I am going to propose legislation--I am eager to find colleagues on the other side of the aisle with whom I can work; I am sure there will be a number of them--to build on this Web site and allow taxpayers to see how the Government spends their tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I wish I could say I thought of this on my own, but the fact is, our comptroller in the State of Texas--may I inquire how much time remains?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud of the work that is being done by the State comptroller of Texas, Susan Combs, who has created a Web site wherethemoneygoes.gov. We need to use greater transparency and the accountability that goes with it to restore public confidence in how Government works. I look forward to working with our colleagues across the aisle and hope to find common ground, not to pick fights and find out where we differ but to find where we can move this country forward and solve  some of the problems that confront us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
