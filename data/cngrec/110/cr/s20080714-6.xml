    <paragraph>I will come later today and give a full statement on some of the things we will try to do this week. I have other matters now, and I am unable to take care of it. But it should be a very productive week. We had a very good week last week. I would hope we can move through these amendments. We have a finite number of them. I hope people will offer their amendments and use whatever time they feel is appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can finish this bill as quickly as possible. It is an important piece of legislation. The President, Senator Biden, and Senator Lugar have been waiting to move this legislation for many months. Hopefully, we can do that this week.</paragraph>
