  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Bush called the timetable a "prescription for chaos and confusion." That timetable was a responsible road map out of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has caused chaos and confusion for 4 long years, replacing one general after another when the general disagrees with the policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has the President given us? He's given us the largest deficit in history. He's cut back from domestic programs to pay for this war. He's weakened our military. Eighty-eight percent of the National Guard is not prepared to go to war. The Army is strained to a breaking point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He's neglected our own people, and he has destroyed Iraq's economy, their social fabric. People are leaving Iraq, fleeing from the chaos the President has caused for 4 long years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a responsible road map. The President should have signed it.</paragraph>
