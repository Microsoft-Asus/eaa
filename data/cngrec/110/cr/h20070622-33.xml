    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mr. Tom and Mrs. Lois Miller on the occasion of their 50th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the institution of marriage is one of the most sacred and effective traditions in civilized society which organizes, holds together and perpetuates continuation of civilized humanity. And to many it is both a civil and religious act. And whereas Tom and Lois Miller have shared 50 years of holy matrimony, I am pleased to pause and wish them well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom and Lois met in McCool, Mississippi, while teenagers and were married after coming to Chicago by Reverend Daniel A. Williams on January 14, 1957. Tom worked at CELO Steel, and later went to the R.C. Cola company, where he retired after a long, satisfying and productive career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lois pursued a career in cosmetology, became one of the best in her field, and subsequently owned her own business, the L &amp; L Beauty Salon, which has been in existence for 47 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Tom and Lois Miller became and still are pillars of their community. They've raised four daughters, have four grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Ever since their marriage they have been rocks of the Greater Zion Missionary Baptist Church, where they have both displayed tremendous leadership, with Tom Miller becoming chairman of the deacon board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were founding members of the 4,500 West Congress Block Club in Chicago and have been active in many other civic and social endeavors, and for the past 10 years have lived in Westchester, Illinois, where they have immersed themselves in community life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 50 years is a long time. And when you can spend those 50 years in a state of peace, happiness and productive engagement, you have been  truly blessed. And just as you have been blessed, you have also blessed others. I've been told that "to those to whom much is given, much is expected in return."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Millers have been fortunate to have a great family, great children, great grandchildren, friends and relatives. Their children, grandchildren, other relatives and friends have been fortunate to have the Millers in their lives. And I wish all of them a great day as they gather for a tremendous celebration on Sunday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I close my comments, Mr. Speaker, with congratulations to Tom and Lois Miller, wish them well and trust that they will have many more years of happy and blissful marriage and that this relationship will continue until the end of time.</paragraph>
