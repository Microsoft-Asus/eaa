    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment today about a recent Washington Post editorial and President &#xC1;lvaro Uribe of Colombia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I noted with interest the Washington Post Sunday editorial concerning criticism President Uribe has received lately. I believe the Washington Post made some good points and asked the right questions. Like, why do some Americans heap criticism on a man who is one of our few allies in a region dominated by the likes of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro and who has dedicated himself to ending the violence in his country and bringing justice to Columbia?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with the Washington Post, that perhaps we should be more discerning in who we criticize and treat those who would be friends to the United Sates with a little more deference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial concerning President Uribe from the Washington Post be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
