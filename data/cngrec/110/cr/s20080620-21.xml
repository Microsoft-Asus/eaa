  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to highlight the importance of acknowledging and celebrating extraordinary efforts by individuals and companies that are leading the way in protecting and preserving America's natural resources. I am honored to congratulate the leadership and employees of Nike Inc., headquartered in my State of Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a new scorecard released by nonprofit group Climate Counts, Nike ranked first among the United States' most climate-friendly companies. The scorecard, first released in June 2007, grades major corporations in well-known consumer sectors from apparel to electronics to fast food--on their commitment to reversing climate change. Nike was judged to have one of the strongest and most transparent programs to reduce climate change among well-known brands across nine industry sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nike has taken aggressive steps to address climate change, including establishing clear goals for lowering carbon emissions at its facilities around the world, designing sustainable products with environmentally preferable materials, purchasing renewable power, and offsetting the emissions from Nike business travel. More importantly, Nike is exporting not only their world class products, but they are also exporting the values of sustainability throughout the world as they continue their efforts  to reduce the company's carbon footprint in its contract manufacturing facilities in Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can also see Nike's commitment to this effort in another very real way. Nike has been a leader in developing sustainable products and components since its inception. Most recently, Nike unveiled the Air Native N7 shoe designed for Native Americans. The N7 in the name is a reference to the seventh generation theory, used by many Native American tribes to look to the three generations preceding them for wisdom and the three generations ahead for their legacy. By designing this sustainable shoe,  Nike is looking ahead to a future that must include greater awareness in protecting our environment and natural resources for the generations to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Oregon continues to build on a long history of innovation in environmental policy and practice. Nike proves once again that everyone doing their small part can achieve huge successes. Nike's legacy continues to grow as they lead the way as an extremely successful company but not forgetting about how important it is to preserve and protect the natural resources around us. I commend the leadership and employees with the Nike team for their stellar efforts and pledge my full support  as they move forward.</paragraph>
