    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the first budget scorekeeping reports for the 2008 budget resolution. The reports, which cover fiscal years 2007 and 2008, were prepared by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reports show the effects of congressional action through June 25, 2007. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con Res. 21, the 2008 budget resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 2007, the estimates show that current level spending equals the budget resolution for both budget authority and outlays while current level revenues exceed the budget resolution by $4.2 billion. For 2008, the estimates show that current level spending is below the budget resolution by $928.1 billion for budget authority and $586.7 billion for outlays while current level revenues exceed the budget resolution level by $34.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the letters and accompanying tables from CBO be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
