  <narrative>EXPAND OUR NATION'S EXPORT MARKETS -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11076]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of expanding our Nation's export markets. Last week Congress was challenged to implement the proposed free trade agreement with Peru. It is a challenge we need to meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agreement laid on the table will create significant new opportunities for American farmers, ranchers, businesses and consumers by opening new markets and reducing trade barriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nebraska's agriculture producers, manufacturers and service providers deserve more access to foreign markets. Last month I hosted a forum on the importance of exports for Nebraska and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trade supports nearly one in five jobs in Nebraska, and Nebraska exported $2.8 billion worth of agriculture products in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opening new export markets has long been a priority of mine. It goes without saying that agriculture markets are tremendously important to my district and the Nation as a whole, and I hope to help Nebraska's products continue to compete in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
