  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus this evening in a special order around education. Today, we celebrate Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. This holiday, celebrated in 14 states, commemorates the announcement of the abolition of slavery in Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This day was a great milestone in American history. Since that time, African-Americans have made great strides in this country. However, even with those great accomplishments, we still find ourselves dealing with glaring disparities in our educational system in this country. It is time that we stop ignoring this issue and bring it to the forefront of our policy discussions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our world becomes increasingly interdependent, we as a Federal Government have a responsibility to provide all of our citizens with an education that will allow them to compete and excel in the global market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, this is not the case. Too many of our minority and economically disadvantaged students are not equipped with the kind of education that will allow them to earn a decent living in order to enjoy American prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a free society like ours, we justify the unequal distribution of wealth by equal opportunity. However, any reasonable person will tell you that opportunities are certainly not equal. Therefore, I hold a strong belief that it is the responsibility of Congress to make policy that provides the most underprivileged along us with an opportunity to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do this by promoting policies that ensure a strong public education system does not leave any child behind. We need to make a strong commitment to our educational system. Our posterity is depending on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home is Cleveland, Ohio, and unfortunately it has been rated as one of the poorest cities, where almost half of the children live below the poverty line. It has been proven again and again that there is a direct correlation between economic prosperity and education. It has also proven that good teachers make good schools. But it's so difficult to attract qualified teachers to impoverished areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No Child Left Behind requires that every State and school district ensure that low-income students have their fair share of qualified and experienced teachers. In high poverty districts in Ohio, 42 percent of the teachers teach classes outside of their expertise. This is problematic, because studies have shown that multiple bad experiences with teachers can negatively impact their students' education. We need to work hard to get quality teachers to high-risk schools so we do not let many teachers  slip through the cracks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another disturbing fact is that only 51 percent of African-American students graduate from high school on time in Ohio. This last year, Cleveland municipal schools only graduated 40 percent of their senior class. This is a blatant failure of our education policy. This problem has no simple solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are talking about inner-city schools with a lack of resources and crumbling infrastructure. We are talking about environments where juvenile delinquency is the norm and some students fear attending class, where budgets are stretched so thin and there is no money available for arts and education and extracurricular activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are schools where classes are overcrowded and the teachers are overwhelmed and forced to teach from outdated text books, and the list goes on. This is not what we intended for our students. We have an obligation to correct this wrong. We need to do more to assist these schools in securing resources that will allow them to lift these students up and provide them with an education that will allow them to continue on to college and to a good-paying job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is so easy for Members of Congress to demagog "No Child Left Behind." But many of us have supported the policy, and its intention is benevolent. We as a country need to strive for academic excellence and opportunity in our country. It has been a tremendously difficult policy to implement and administer, but we cannot give up on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a complicated primary and secondary education system with responsibility spread through all levels of government. To reach a high level of educational opportunity nationally is a paramount task, but we must persevere. The system already works for haves, and we have an obligation to see it work for the have-nots.</paragraph>
