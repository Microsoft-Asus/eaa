    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, I was a freshman member of the Tennessee State Senate, and on that occasion, the University of Memphis now, then Memphis State University, became number one in the country in basketball. It was the first time that we had ever had a number one ranking, and I got up on the floor of the Tennessee Senate and spoke proudly about my basketball team and their number one ranking. That night, my Tigers lost, and they were no longer number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, today, 25 years later and a freshman Member in the United States House of Representatives, the University of Memphis is again the number one basketball team in the country. Should I talk about them? Not.</paragraph>
