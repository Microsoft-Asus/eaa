    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th anniversary of Temple Emanuel in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Temple Emanuel is a Jewish reform congregation in Winston-Salem known for consistently reaching out beyond the Jewish community to embrace people from all walks of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Temple Emanuel is identified in the area as a community with a long history of actively engaging the issues that confront the people of Winston-Salem. Its example clearly illustrates how important the tradition of American religious communities' involvement in civic and community life is in an age of what often seems like increasing individual disengagement. I commend the members of Temple Emanuel for their faithful example of outreach and investment in others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This ethic is embodied in the leadership of Rabbi Mark Strauss-Cohn. His commitment to service and religious dialogue recently earned him the Everyone Can Help Out Award from the Winston-Salem Foundation for his efforts to bridge religious differences by teaching community classes on Judaism. Rabbi Strauss-Cohn has also led  by example by involving Temple Emanuel in housing projects with Habitat for Humanity and other activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Temple Emanuel was founded as a reform congregation in the 1930s. When it was incorporated, it boasted 63 family memberships. Today the congregation has grown to more than 250 families. I look forward to seeing this fine Jewish congregation continue to grow and make a positive impact on its community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I send my best wishes on this significant anniversary, and wish everyone at Temple Emanuel many more years of celebrating and practicing their Jewish faith and heritage.</paragraph>
