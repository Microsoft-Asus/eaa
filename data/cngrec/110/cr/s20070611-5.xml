    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3:30 p.m., with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. At 3:30 p.m., the Senate will have 2 hours of debate as follows: an hour on the motion to proceed to the energy legislation, and the second hour will be debate on the motion to proceed to the legislation expressing no confidence in Attorney General Gonzales.
