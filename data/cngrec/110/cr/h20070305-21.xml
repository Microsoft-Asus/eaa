    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all remember, February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia suffered a tragic failure during reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. As a result, seven crew members sadly lost their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="807">H.R. 807</bill>, introduced by Representative Gohmert, would authorize a study to determine how best to protect four parcels of land in east Texas where large portions of the wreckage were recovered. In addition to specific sites identified in the bill, the Secretary of the Interior would be authorized to recommend additional sites to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Nation continues to mourn the loss of the Columbia. We support the passage of <bill type="h" number="807">H.R. 807</bill>, an important step toward ensuring that the sacrifices made by her crew and their families will always be remembered. We commend the Congressman for introducing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield as much time as he may consume to the author of this particular piece of legislation, the distinguished and debonair Congressman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his kindness and sensitivity in this issue, as well as the gentleman from Utah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to properly commemorate and memorialize one of this Nation's most heroic, yet heartbreaking, tragedies. The disintegration of the Space Shuttle Columbia as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere in the spring of 2003 deserves such a memorialization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will serve to begin the process of appropriately honoring the gallantry and sacrifice, not only of the seven brave souls of their crew and their families, but also the vast number of citizens who worked tirelessly in the recovery effort following the catastrophe. This bill will start that process that will ultimately result in appropriate memorialization of all the selfless and heroic efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, parts of the shuttle were strewn over hundreds of miles of east Texas in my district, and the commitment of east Texans in the effort to recover as much of the wreckage as possible was pivotal in determining the cause of the incident in order to save future lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ultimate sacrifice was made by Commander Rick Husband, Pilot William McCool, Payload Commander Michael Anderson, Mission Specialist David Brown, Mission Specialist Kalpana Chalwa, Payload Commander Ilan Ramon, and Mission Specialist and Medical Doctor Laurel Blair Salton Clark who was the wife of my Texas A&amp;M classmate John Clark, who himself is also a patriot as a captain in the United States Navy. John and Laura also have a wonderful son. All of these American heroes deserve a memorial  befitting their devotion to their fellow man, their spirit of exploration and discovery, as well as their courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days and weeks following the tragedy, countless east Texans volunteered to help and support the tireless Federal workers who were charged with locating the shuttle debris.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Volunteers gave selflessly of their time and their resources by participating in searches, opening their homes, preparing food and serving the many people taking part in the recovery effort in towns such as San Augustine, Nacogdoches, Lufkin, Hemphill, as well as most of east Texas itself. San Augustine City Manager Duke Lyons said at the time the volunteers provided 3,000 to 4,000 meals per day in his area alone and did all that they could to provide shelter and anything else that was needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legendary hospitality of east Texas was on display as business owners donated supplies, building space and other assets to support the Forest Service, FEMA, National Guard, and other governmental entities taking part in the recovery. All told, east Texans spent countless weeks supporting the 10,000 people searching for the shuttle remains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The efforts of these constituents are best summed up by three fellow east Texans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Texas Ranger Pete Maskunas said, "We got to see a small portion of east Texas pull together in a big way. The people here don't have much, but we gave everything that we had. We showed the Nation that, here in east Texas, we have got a big heart, and we are here to make things a lot better for people we don't even know."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>San Augustine County Judge Wayne Holt said, "From the smallest child to the oldest man, if you needed somebody, they were there."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nacogdoches County Judge Sue Kennedy said, "The generosity and unselfish, tireless efforts by the wonderful people of east Texas were so compelling and moving that even in 2007 we are being asked to teach seminars on how to mobilize an entire area in a sudden emergency."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="807">H.R. 807</bill>, the Columbia Space Shuttle Memorial Study Act, because those involved deserve it. Thank you again to the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona, and the ranking member.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The tragedy of the Space Shuttle Columbia has touched the hearts of all of us, and Mr. Gohmert should be commended for his attention to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge adoption of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of <bill type="h" number="807">H.R. 807</bill>, the Columbia Space Shuttle Memorial Study Act, a bill which would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the feasibility and suitability of establishing a memorial to the Space Shuttle Columbia in Texas and including it within the National Park System. This legislation is an important step toward honoring the courage and contributions of the crew of STS-107 and toward continuing  to heal as a nation four years after the tragedy of the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just over four years ago, the Nation lost seven heroes, Michael Anderson, David Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark, Rick Husband, Willie McCool, and Ilan Ramon. They were mothers and fathers, wives and husbands, daughters and sons, teachers and friends. There is one characteristic, however, that unites them all. They are all heroes in the truest sense of the word. We draw our strength and resolve from the example they set and we remain committed to our Nation's space program in their honor and  because of all they have taught us. Today, we have the opportunity to further memorialize their contributions to space exploration and their inspirational lives by taking steps toward creating a  permanent memorial to them and their service on behalf of our country in Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guam has a unique relationship with one of the crew members, Lieutenant Commander William C. McCool, who piloted the Columbia on that fateful day. Commander McCool lived in Guam while his father served as a Navy pilot and he attended Dededo Middle School and John F. Kennedy High School. He later married Lani Vallejos of Dededo, Guam. While America lost a hero, Guam lost a son in the aftermath of the Columbia tragedy. Commander McCool blessed our island and indeed our country  with his passion, intellect, and purpose. The people of Guam are proud to call him one of our own and will always remember him as a role model for our children. The inspiration Commander McCool has been to our people is something that will not fade and that can never be taken away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This memorial, as a part of the National Park System, will allow future generations to learn about the sacrifices the STS-107 crew made in the name of scientific advancements. It will be a testament to their courage and dedication to their colleagues and this Nation. I hope that the memorial will inspire all those who see it to believe in their dreams and their potential to achieve those dreams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foundation of this country is built on the hard work and dedication of people with novel and exciting ideas. The crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia embodied these American ideals and believed in the need for scientific advancement and space exploration. A national memorial to their lives and dreams will continue to inspire the spirit of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us always remember the courage and inspiration of the seven crewmembers of the Space Shuttle Columbia. This memorial, situated in the state where they dedicated their careers to space exploration, will be a testament to their lives and their legacy. I thank my colleague, Mr. Gohmert, for sponsoring this important legislation.</paragraph>
