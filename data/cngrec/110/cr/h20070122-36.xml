  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will receive the constitutional address from the executive, and I hope tomorrow that an olive branch will be extended to this Congress, an equal branch of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend has seen some 25 U.S. soldiers fall in battle. To their families and their loved ones, I mourn their loss. They are heroes. And so I rise to thank the United States military for heroically and courageously doing their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now it is time for the Congress to be heroic and courageous and cease the funding of this ill-fated war. We are now to reject any suggestion that continued funding protects our soldiers. Unless the President has a political and diplomatic solution, no amount of military force is going to resolve this sectarian fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I vote for cutting off the funds. I vote for a courageous and heroic Congress  to save the lives of the young men and women of America, and I thank them for their valiant and courageous service.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
