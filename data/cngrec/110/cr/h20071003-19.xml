    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress has a strong record of delivering on our promise to the American people and providing real and meaningful change. And we have done so in a fiscally responsible way, instituting pay-as-you-go, deficit reduction discipline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One area where we have made real progress for the American people is by supporting the men and women who serve our Nation in the Armed Forces. Under Democratic control, this House provided substantially more than the President requested for the new M- RAP vehicles proven to save lives in Iraq. We voted to give our troops a pay raise that the President called "unnecessary." We strengthened military health care with the Wounded Warriors Act to clean  up the inadequate care of wounded soldiers at Walter Reed and other facilities. And the Democratic House voted to provide the largest increase in funding for VA health care in the history of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these investments that support our veterans and troops overseas are just a few examples of how our Democratic Congress is taking America in a new direction.</paragraph>
