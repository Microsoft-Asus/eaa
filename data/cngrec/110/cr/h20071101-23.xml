    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, November 1, I was unable to vote on rollcall votes Nos. 1030, 1031, 1032, and 1033 due to a prior commitment in my district. Had I been present I would have voted "no" on rollcall votes Nos. 1030, 1031 and 1032, and "yea" on rollcall vote No. 1033.</paragraph>
