    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my motion is very straightforward. It simply instructs the managers on the part of the House to insist that two important provisions included in the House bill be included in the conference report. The first provision, House section 416, prohibits funds in the bill from being used to provide housing assistance to illegal or otherwise unauthorized immigrants. This provision was offered as an amendment on the House floor and adopted unanimously. The second provision, House section  417, prohibits any funds in the bill from being used to hire illegal aliens. This, too, was an amendment adopted unanimously when the House considered the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has clearly spoken on this matter, and I think it is important the conferees uphold the will of the House. I urge the adoption of the motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Michigan has already said, the provisions that are in the legislation on the House side, section 416 and 417, are two provisions that relate to illegal immigration. The first of those provisions is one which states that no funds in this act can be used to provide homeownership assistance for illegal immigrants. The second, section 417, says that no funds may be used to employ workers who are illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first of these sections applies to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the second one applies to the Department of Transportation and relates to people who might otherwise be employed in construction under the Department of Transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Michigan has pointed out, those were adopted unanimously by voice vote here in the House during the passage of this legislation. So they are before the conference and, because they were adopted earlier, I am willing to adopt them now and adopt the motion as is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Bilbray).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to say I appreciate the bipartisan support for the concept that people should not be rewarded for breaking our immigration laws. I appreciate the ranking member and the chairman agreeing on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just ask both of you to take a look at the leadership that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Shuler) has made with a piece of legislation that I feel should be the enforcement part of this direction, and that is that the e-verification be used before people benefit from public funds. That is a very simple system to allow anyone to check that Social Security numbers and names match. It's not an onerous check system to use, and it is one that many of us are looking forward  to not only Federal Government but all employers using in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just ask that you consider the fact that to fulfill the intent of this motion, that the e-verification specifically try to be considered here as the vehicle that before anyone gets these benefits that we check that they are legally here as verified by the e-verification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If anybody has any questions about that, I am sure Congressman Shuler can brief you extensively on it. But it is sort of the consensus of most of us working on these issues that this is a simple, clear way to allow everyone, including those who are providing public benefit, the assurance that those benefits are not going to somebody who's not qualified to be able to provide it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would raise that as a discussion, that the e-verification be used to verify this motion.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="MOTION TO INSTRUCT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the comments by the gentleman from California, but just point out that that is a very complicated issue, not a part of the conference that we are involved in, and will take a bit more time, probably more than we can resolve today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am ready to yield back if the gentleman from Michigan has no other speakers.</paragraph>
