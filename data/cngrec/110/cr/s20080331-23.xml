    <paragraph>Mr. President, I pay tribute to the Northern Kentucky University women's basketball team. The Norse defeated the University of South Dakota 63 to 58 to capture the NCAA Division II Championship on March 29, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the second time the Northern Kentucky University women's basketball team has won the NCAA Division II Championship. The last time the Norse reached the pinnacle of their sport was in the 1999 to 2000 season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The citizens of Kentucky are proud to have these national champs living and learning in the Northern Kentucky community. Their example of hard work and determination should be followed by all in the Commonwealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the players for their success in bringing another championship trophy to the campus of Northern Kentucky University. I also want to congratulate their coaches, along with their peers, faculty, administrators, and parents for their support and sacrifices they have made to help them meet their achievements and dreams. They all represent Kentucky honorably.</paragraph>
