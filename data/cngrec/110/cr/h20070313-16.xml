  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Washington Post has usually been associated with the Democratic Party. Today's lead editorial is especially courageous in criticizing the Democratic plan for Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to draw to your attention the following: "In short, the Democratic proposal being taken up this week is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself. Will Iraq collapse into unrestrained civil conflict with massive civilian casualties, as the U.S. intelligence community predicts, in the event of rapid withdrawal? Will al Qaeda establish a powerful new base for launching attacks on the United States and its allies? Ms. Pelosi's strategy  leads not toward a responsible withdrawal from Iraq, but to a constitutional struggle with Mr. Bush, who has already said he will veto the legislation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of both parties should acknowledge the point of this editorial. Al Qaeda spokesman for Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, has clearly identified that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in the global war on terrorism. To undermine Iraq as clearly part of a global war puts American families at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
