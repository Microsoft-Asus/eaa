  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="NATIONAL WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the National Week of the Young Child. This week provides all of us here in Washington the opportunity to reflect on the ways in which we can better care for children in our communities and more effectively cooperate with teachers, parents, and other caregivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Critical to the success of many disadvantaged Iowa children is the Head Start program. If we really want to get kids ready for school, we must focus on early intervention. This means improving access to education and developmental services to help provide kids with a good start in life. Since 1965, Head Start has served more than 24 million low-income children and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Head Start programs help Iowa families to meet young children's basic educational, health, nutritional and social needs with a goal of having these kids ready for the first day of kindergarten. I was pleased to recently help modernize and update Head Start by passing The Head Start for School Readiness Act, which allows more families access to programs, improves early childhood training for Head Start educators, and updates learning standards to reflect the latest research in child development.  I also made sure that early learning programs do not ignore the importance of wellness and healthy behaviors by requiring training to integrate physical activity and good nutrition in the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard tremendous stories from my State of children whose lives were improved through the social services Head Start provides. These children received eye glasses or necessary dental work thanks to the early intervention of our Head Start programs. Head Start educators and employees often connect parents in need to the outreach services which help give children safe and comfortable homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was particularly touched by the story of Rebecca Navarro. She writes that her youngest son, Anthony, received help learning his letters and colors, and improved his social skills, through their local Head Start agency. At the same time, a Head Start social worker helped Ms. Navarro go back to school and receive her degree, pay for food and utilities and provide a better quality of life for Anthony and his four siblings. Anthony has now successfully graduated the 6th grade with math skills above  his grade level, and plans on going to college and getting his master's degree in engineering and math.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing our Nation's youngest learners with the tools they need to succeed benefits not only those children and their families, but our Nation as well. While celebrating the victories of Head Start this week, we should also continue to work hard to ensure every child has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.</paragraph>
