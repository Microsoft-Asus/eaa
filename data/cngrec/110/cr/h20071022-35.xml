    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Federal regulation process is among the most important ways by which our Nation implements public policy. Each year, agencies issue thousands of regulations to ensure that the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the cars we drive are safe. Surprisingly, however, there is little empirical analysis of whether these regulations work as intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until 1995, the last year it received federal funding, the Administrative Conference of the United States was a nonpartisan, public-private think tank that provided invaluable guidance to Congress about how to improve the administrative and regulatory process. First established on a temporary basis, the conference, over the course of its nearly 30-year existence, made numerous recommendations, many of which were enacted into law. <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill>, the Regulatory Improvement Act of 2007, would simply  reauthorize the conference for an additional 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, some might ask why we should reauthorize an entity that has not been in existence for nearly a dozen years. Let me just mention three reasons. First, the conference saved taxpayers many millions of dollars. It helped agencies implement cost-saving procedures and made recommendations that work to eliminate excessive litigation costs and long delays. Just one agency alone, the Social Security Administration, estimated that the conference's recommendation to change its appeals process  yielded approximately $85 million in savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Justice Stephen Breyer testified before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law about the "huge" savings to the public resulting from the conference's recommendations. Justice Antonin Scalia likewise agreed that it was an "enormous bargain."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the Administrative Conference promoted innovation among agencies. For example, it convinced 24 agencies to use alternative dispute resolution for issues concerning the private sector. The conference also spearheaded the implementation of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act, governing consumer product warranties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the conference played a major role in encouraging agencies to promulgate smarter regulations. It did this by improving participation in the rulemaking process, promoting judicial review of agency regulations, and reducing regulatory burdens on the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, and perhaps more importantly, Congress needs the conference. Experience with the Congressional Review Act demonstrates that we simply lack the resources and, sometimes, the political will to conduct aggressive oversight of regulations. Congressional recognition of the conference's significant contributions to the regulatory process is probably best evidenced by the fact that in nearly every Congress since its demise in 1995, legislation has been introduced assigning responsibilities to  the conference. The Congressional Research Service advises that reactivation of the conference comes at an opportune time, especially in light of efforts by the executive branch to augment its role in the regulatory process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there are few entities that enjoyed more bipartisan support than the Administrative Conference. I commend my colleague, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, Mr. Cannon of Utah, for his continued leadership in pursuing the reauthorization of the conference. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to insert into the Record two letters from Supreme Court Justices Breyer and Scalia written in 1995 that describe the importance of the Administrative Conference of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, August 21, 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SENATOR GRASSLEY, thank you for the invitation to submit a few comments about the Administrative Conference of the United States. As a "liaison" to the Administrative Conference (from the Judicial Conference), I have participated in its activities from 1981 to 1994. I believe that the Conference is a unique organization, carrying out work that is important and beneficial to the average American, at rather low cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Conference primarily examines government agency procedures and practices, searching for ways to help agencies function more fairly and more efficiently. It normally focuses upon achieving "semi-technical" reform, that is to say, changes in practices that are general (involving more than a handful of cases and, often, more than one agency) but which are not so controversial or politically significant as to likely provoke a general debate, say, in Congress. Thus, it may study, and adopt recommendations  concerning better rule-making procedures, or ways to avoid legal technicalities, controversies, and delays through agency use of negotiation, or ways of making judicial review of agency action less technical and easier for ordinary citizens to obtain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administrative Conference is unique in that it develops its recommendations by bringing together at least four important groups of people: top-level agency administrators; professional agency staff; private (including "public interest") practitioners; and academicians. The Conference will typically commission a study by an academician, say, a law professor, who often has the time to conduct the study thoughtfully, but may lack first-hand practical experience. The professor will spend time  with agency staff, which often has otherwise unavailable facts and experience, but may lack the time for general reflection and comparisons with other agencies. The professor's draft will be reviewed and discussed by private practitioners, who bring to it a critically important practical perspective,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In seeking to answer the question, "Who will control the regulators?" most governments have found it necessary to develop institutions that continuously review, and recommend changes in, technical agency practices. In some countries, ombudsmen, in dealing with citizen complaints, will also recommend changes in practices and procedures. Sometimes, as in France and Canada, expert tribunals will review decisions of other agencies and help them improve their procedures. Sometimes, as in Australia  and the United Kingdom, special councils will advise ministries about needed procedural reforms. Our own Nation has developed this rather special approach</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not see any other institution readily available to perform this same task. Individual agencies, while trying to reform  themselves, sometimes lack the ability to make cross-agency comparisons. The American Bar Association's Administrative Law Section, while a fine institution, cannot call upon the time and resources of agency staff members and agency heads as readily as can the Administrative Conference. Congressional staffs cannot as easily conduct  the technical research necessary to develop many of the Conference's more technical proposals. The Office of Management and Budget does not normally concern itself with general procedural proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this is to explain why I believe the Administrative Conference performs a necessary function, which, in light of the cost, is worth maintaining. I recognize that the Conference is not the most well known of government agencies; indeed, it is widely known only within a fairly small (administrative practice oriented) community. But, that, in my view, simply reflects the fact that it does its job, developing consensus about change in fairly technical areas. That is a job that the public, whether  or not it knows the name "Administrative Conference," needs to have done. And, for the reasons I have given, I believe the Administrative Conference well suited to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope these views will help you in your evaluation of the Conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yours sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>UNITED STATES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 31, 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SENATOR GRASSLEY: Thank you for the invitation to appear at the hearing on "The Reauthorization of the Administrative Conference" scheduled for August 2. I will be unable to do so, but your staff has advised me that a letter would be appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not a good source of information concerning recent accomplishments of the Conference. I have not followed its activities closely since stepping down as its Chairman in 1974. I can testify, however, concerning the nature of the Conference, and its suitability for achieving its objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Conference seeks to combine the efforts of scholars, practitioners, and agency officials to improve the efficiency and fairness of the thousands of varieties of federal agency procedures. In my judgment, it is an effective mechanism for achieving that goal, which demands change and improvement in obscure areas where bureaucratic inertia and closed-mindedness often prevail. A few of the Conference's projects have had major, government-wide impact--for example, its recommendation leading to  Congress's adoption of Public Law 94-574, which abolished the doctrine of sovereign immunity in suits seeking judicial review of agency action. For the most part, however, each of the Conference's projects is narrowly focused upon a particular agency program,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One way of judging the worth of the Conference without becoming expert in the complex and unexciting details of administrative procedure with which it deals, is to examine the roster of men and women who have thought it worthwhile to devote their time and talent to the enterprise. Over the years, the academics who have served as consultants to or members of the Conference have been a virtual Who's Who of leading scholars in the field of administrative law; and the practitioners who have served  as members have been, by and large, prominent and widely respected lawyers in the various areas of administrative practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was the third Chairman of the Administrative Conference. Like the first two (Prof. Jerre Williams of the University of Texas Law School, and Prof. Roger Cramton of the University of Michigan Law School), and like my successor (Prof. Robert Anthony of Cornell Law School) I was an academic--on leave from the University of Virginia Law School. The Conference was then, and I believe remains, a unique combination of scholarship and practicality, of private-sector insights and career-government expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would not presume to provide the Subcommittee advice on the ultimate question of whether, in a time of budget constraints, the benefits provided by the Administrative Conference are within our Nation's means. But I can say that in my view those benefits are substantial: the Conference has been an effective means of opening up the process of government to needed improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400059" topic="ANTONIN SCALIA.">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill>. I would like to, first of all, thank the gentlewoman from California for her leadership on this issue. I appreciate working with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted that <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill>, which would reauthorize the Administrative Conference of the United States, is being considered on the floor today. I urge support of this measure. I also urge the Appropriations Committee to appropriate funds to ACUS so that this organization can once again become a living, breathing reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am a believer in the adage that the government that governs best governs least; but when the government does govern, it must govern as its best. ACUS is just the organization to help us achieve that goal. Before its funding ceased some years ago, it laid down a decades-long track record of productive activity that was remarkable, unmistakable, and probably unparalleled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of its 28-year existence, the conference issued more than 200 recommendations, some of which were governmentwide and others that were agency specific. It issued a series of recommendations eliminating a variety of technical impediments to the judicial review of agency action and encouraging less costly consensual alternatives to litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fruits of these efforts include the enactment of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990, which established a framework for the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In addition to this legislation, ACUS served as the key implementing agency for the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, the Congressional Accountability Act, and the Magnusson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act. The Conference also made recommendations regarding implementation  of the Congressional Accountability Act and played a key role in the Clinton administration's National Performance Review with respect to improving regulatory systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, time and again, ACUS took the small amount of taxpayer funds that we appropriated and produced enormous savings in the costs incurred and imposed by Federal regulatory agencies. That record is so clear that I can say with absolute confidence that, if we were not to authorize ACUS, we would effectively authorize waste in the rest of the Federal Government. I can say with equal confidence that if the Appropriations Committee were not to appropriate funds to ACUS after the Congress  passes this bill, it would effectively appropriate waste by the Federal Government to the tune of millions upon millions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of you may know my enthusiasm for ACUS, and it will not surprise you that hordes of experts, officials and stakeholders outside of these walls, share that same enthusiasm as well, including Justices Scalia and Breyer, both of whom worked with ACUS in an earlier part of their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To quote just one legal luminary, "If the conference didn't exist, it would have to be invented." Thankfully, we don't need to invent it. We did that long ago. We know it was a great invention. All we need to do is to reauthorize it today and to appropriate funds for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, regulations play a critical role in virtually every aspect of our daily lives, yet there is no independent, nonpartisan entity that Congress can utilize to scrutinize and approve the regulatory process. Accordingly, it is critical that we reauthorize the Administrative Conference of the United States as soon as possible so that it can fill this serious void.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize that this may not be the sexiest issue on the docket today, but I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#xE1;nchez) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3564">H.R. 3564</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
