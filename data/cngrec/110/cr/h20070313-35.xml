    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is great that I got the opportunity today to work with the gentleman from Iowa. We have worked on several things, and I think this is a very fitting bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="478">H.R. 478</bill> designates the Federal building and the United States courthouse located at 101 Barr Street in Lexington, Kentucky as the Scott Reed Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The bill recognizes Judge Reed's service to the legal profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Scott Reed graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law where he received many honors. Judge Reed's career as a jurist began in 1964, when he became Fayette Circuit Court judge. Five years later, he was elected to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, where he sat for over 7 years. During the mid 1970s, Judge Reed played an instrumental role in the recognition of Kentucky's judicial system, which created the Kentucky Supreme Court. Judge Reed was elected to serve as the first Chief  Justice of Kentucky in 1976. His opinions from the Supreme Court of Kentucky have received national acclaim for their content.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In 1979 he was named U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, and he served as U.S. district judge until he retired in 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. This is a very fitting individual and a fitting tribute to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400442" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for his help on this legislation, something that is near and dear to my heart. I also thank the gentleman from Missouri for his nice words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This courthouse and the naming of this courthouse is very special to many people in Kentucky because Scott Reed was a special man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="478">H.R. 478</bill> is a bill to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 101 Barr Street in Lexington, Kentucky as the "Scott Reed Federal Building and United States Courthouse." I can think of no other individual more deserving, no other public servant more worthy, and no other action more appropriate than naming the Federal courthouse in Lexington after the Honorable Scott Reed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prominent central Kentucky attorney, first Chief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court, and Federal judge, Scott Reed exemplifies the definition of honor and integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Lexington, Kentucky, on July 3, 1921, Scott Reed graduated with distinction from the University of Kentucky. While in college, he was editor-in-chief of the Kentucky Law Journal and awarded the order of the Coif, the highest academic award that can be given to a law graduate. He was also a member of the Phi Delta Phi Fraternity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He achieved many honors at the University of Kentucky, culminating upon graduation as the recipient of the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Medallion, a prestigious award recognizing outstanding character and humanitarian service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to his time on the bench, Scott Reed was County Attorney. He was retained as counsel for the Fayette County School Board and distinguished himself as a trial lawyer of great integrity. He served from 1948 through 1956 as an associate professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law. From 1964 until 1969, he was judge of the First Division of the Fayette Circuit Court, the top trial court in Kentucky's second largest county. He then was elected to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, at  that time the highest court in the Commonwealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chief Judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Judge Reed oversaw the passage of a constitutional amendment that unified and modernized Kentucky's court system. As part of the modernization, the Court of Appeals became the Kentucky Supreme Court. Reed was elected by his fellow justices at that time to be the first Chief Justice of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As Chief Justice, he oversaw the implementation of a constitutional amendment that led to Kentucky's having one of the most efficient  court systems in the country. The Chief Justice of the Commonwealth holds equal rank with the Governor, the latter being the head of the Executive Branch and Chief Justice serving as the head of the Judiciary and its myriad of administrative offices throughout the State. Judge Reed was elected as a Fellow in the National College of the Judiciary in 1965 and was a voting member of the American Law Institute, a body of scholarly people who shape the laws of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opinions written by Scott Reed during his time on the Supreme Court of Kentucky have received national acclaim. Judge Reed was a frequent lecturer to the National College of Trial Judges and has achieved the highest honors that can be bestowed on a member of his profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1979 he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky. He served as a U.S. district judge until he retired in 1990, rounding out his judicial career having served on the local, State, and Federal benches. Scott Reed was named to the University of Kentucky College of Law Hall of Distinguished Alumni on April 11, 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Reed passed away on February 17, 1994, but his legacy will always be a part of Kentucky's rich history. He richly deserves this honor, one that is indeed long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Mr. Rogers of Kentucky for being a cosponsor of this legislation. Again, I thank my colleagues from Iowa and Missouri for their help on bringing this to the floor, and I urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would associate myself with the remarks Mr. Chandler made. I appreciate that. Judge Reed was truly an outstanding individual in many respects and served with great distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="478">H.R. 478</bill> and urge its passage.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="478">H.R. 478</bill>, a bill to designate the Federal building located at 101 Barr Street in Lexington, Kentucky, as the "Scott Reed Federal Building and United States Courthouse". The bill was introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler) and his colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scott Reed was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1921. He attended local schools and graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1945. While at the University, Reed received many awards and honors, including the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Medallion for excellence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first years of Judge Reed's career were spent in private practice during which he distinguished himself as a trial lawyer of great integrity. During this time, he also taught at the University of Kentucky College of Law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1964 to 1969, Judge Reed was judge of the First Division of the Fayette Circuit Court. From 1969 until 1976, he served on the Court of Appeals, 5th Appellate District. In 1976, Judge Reed became the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, a position which holds equal rank with the Governor. His opinions from the Supreme Court of Kentucky have received national attention for their scholarly content and careful judicial reasoning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August, 1979, Judge Reed was nominated by President Carter to the federal bench. He was confirmed later that year and served until his death in 1994. During his confirmation hearing, Judge Reed was characterized as possessing a great sense of fairness and objectivity, practical legal experience, and great respect for the law and its responsibility to our Nation's citizens. Both Senator Huddleston and Senator Ford participated in Judge Reed's confirmation hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Reed enjoyed a rich and rewarding career. His contributions to the American judicial system are exceptional. It is fitting that the United States Courthouse located in Lexington, Kentucky, bear his name to honor his distinguished career and enduring legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="478">H.R. 478</bill> and urge its passage.</paragraph>
