  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="RETIREMENT OF JAMES F. AHRENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the distinguished career of James F. Ahrens, who will soon retire as head of the Montana Hospital Association. Jim Ahrens has been a mainstay of Montana's health care community for over two decades, and I know that I speak for that community when I say that his presence as the head of MHA will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Ahrens has served as president of MHA ..... An Association of Montana Health Care Providers, for nearly 21 years. Health care has changed a lot since the mid-1980s, in good ways and bad. Our scientists have developed remarkable new treatments. Yet, as ranks of the uninsured grow, many Americans can't take advantage of those treatments. We have prevented Medicare's trust fund from going broke. Yet the program still faces serious long-term fiscal challenges. We have enacted the most significant  change Part D--in Medicare's history. Yet the new benefit has been marred by early administrative missteps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a key player in health care over the last two decades, I have relied on Jim to gain a better understanding of these ever-changing events. I have also come to know Jim as a close personal friend. When it comes to Jim, I don't have any `and yets.' I can think of no better example than that than his work on the Critical Access Hospital program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in the late 1980s, a citizens' task force came up with the idea of a limited service hospital for rural and frontier areas. This new type of hospital would provide access to primary care in the most remote stretches of the country, while receiving a break from the strict regulatory requirements governing hospitals and health facilities. The Montana Legislature took the recommendations for this new type of facility and created a special licensure category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As incoming leader of MHA, Jim's job was to bring the concept to life. Having just moved from Chicago to run the Montana Hospital Association, he hit the ground running. Jim worked with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services to develop a demonstration project for this  new type of facility. He and I then worked with the Federal Department of Health and Human Services' regional office in Denver to establish a demonstration project and  secure a Federal grant to fund it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This demonstration project--the Medical Assistance Facility Project--was hugely successful and served as the model for the Critical Access Hospital Program that I authored in 1997. Today, more than 1,300 hospitals around the Nation enjoy CAH status, ensuring access to high-quality medical treatment in some of the most remote parts of our land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud to have written that bill and to have made changes to improve the CAH program since then. I am just as proud to have worked with Jim in the process. With over 45 CAHs operating in Montana, the idea of a limited-service rural hospital has moved from concept to the mainstream. I have no doubt that the CAH Program has kept a number of Montana hospitals from closing. And when you are dealing with Montana-sized distances in health care, that can mean the difference between life and  death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through it all, Jim has been a mainstay. Always patient and kind but always thinking ahead, his innovative style and vision have brought people together for a healthier Montana. He changed MHA ..... from a collection of hospitals to MHA ..... An Association of Montana Health Care Providers--a united group of hospitals, nursing homes, home health organizations, hospices, and physicians. He applied the same philosophy to form the Alliance for a Healthy Montana--a coalition of more than 25 health  care organizations. The Alliance is now an effective and cohesive voice for health care change in Montana and came about almost solely because of Jim's efforts. Over the past 8 years, the Alliance has spearheaded three ballot initiatives, including one that reformed Montana's tobacco tax rate and two others that earmarked national tobacco settlement funds to pay for health care programs in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes sense that Jim would take the consensus approach that he did, working to build a coalition from a group constituencies that weren't obvious allies. After all, Jim has spent his entire career as an executive in health care associations. He understood--and showed by example--the powerful role associations can play in representing members' needs before Congress, legislatures, regulatory agencies, and private organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, Jim has been a trusted adviser to me throughout the last two decades. I have come to trust his perspective, judgment, and knowledge on health issues great and small. I have also benefited from Jim's friendship. He is a gracious, compassionate, and generous person--the kind of guy people like to be around. And while the people of MHA will miss having Jim around, I know that his family and friends look forward to seeing a bit more of this exceptional individual. Jim's transition will  be complete on June 30, when he makes his retirement official. On behalf of a healthier Montana, we wish Jim Ahrens well.</paragraph>
