    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning we learned of the death of William F. Buckley, Jr. I wanted to come to the floor and reminisce a bit about Bill Buckley, whom I have been privileged to know for more than 40 years, and to pay tribute to a devoted and patriotic American, a remarkably creative and eloquent man of letters, a person with an extraordinary sense of humor and a kind of spirit to him that infused anyone around him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a person who believed in the power of ideas and loved the exchange of ideas. He lived a remarkable life, with great effect for this country that he loved, and a tremendous impact on people who read his novels, his books, and his columns in the National Review, or watched him for so many years on that wonderfully thoughtful, cerebral, provocative TV program "Firing Line," which was open not just to conservatives such as Bill Buckley, but to people with all shades of opinion who were willing  to engage him--Bill Buckley, WFB--on the field of ideas. A remarkable man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was privileged to get to know him more than 40 years ago when I became the editor--at Yale, of course, editor wasn't a good enough title. I was called the chairman of the board of the Yale Daily News. And there was a gentleman at the Yale Daily News named Francis Donahue--Tackie Donahue--and he had been there forever as the permanent business manager. I remember the day after I was chosen, he told me he had informed Bill Buckley of this in one of his regular memos back and forth to Buckley.  I was fascinated by this and began a communication with Bill Buckley at that time, and he took a wonderfully warm, kind of brotherly interest in those who were at the Yale Daily News, as he had been in the early 1950s. He invited me and a couple of our friends from the news to come to his house in Stamford, CT, for a dinner or two, which were stimulating, thrilling evenings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our friendship went on, and I will come back to that, but Buckley's life is an extraordinary life. He came out of Yale, became very well known for a book he wrote about what he thought was the hostile environment at Yale toward people of faith, toward people who were conservative, et cetera, et cetera, "God and Man at Yale." He went from that to starting the National Review in the mid-1950s. I believe it was 1955. I remember reading once that he had said in the founding issue that the publication  would derive from original ideas of the moral order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Buckley was a person who studied history, studied literature, learned from it, and also was infused with a deep and profound commitment to his Roman Catholic faith. That, I think, was the origin of the moral order which he gave expression to in all that he did in writing for the National Review and speaking out and conducting himself as a provocative, loving American. He believed that ideas mattered, and they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Review, in some sense, gave birth to the modern American conservative movement. But it wasn't always a Republican movement. His was a matter of ideals and ideas and philosophy--conservatism. Incidentally, he rejected   extremism. To his everlasting credit, he took on the extremists of the John Birch Society, which wasn't popular for him to do at the time he did it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am just remembering words of Buckley. He said he was a conservative ideologically, not always favorable to Republican candidates. I remember reading about an editorial he wrote in the National Review endorsing General Eisenhower for President. While everyone else was echoing the slogan "We Like Ike," Buckley's editorial said, "We Prefer Ike." So it was a relative judgment that he made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was thrilled, of course, much more by the candidacy of a former Member of this body, a distinguished Member, Senator Barry Goldwater, and most of all by the candidacy of President Reagan. At one point, in the mid-1960s, he ran for mayor of New York. And again as a kind of joyous, thought- provoking, elegant, eloquent exercise in being involved in the marketplace of public ideas, perhaps most famous, though perhaps not the most substantive thing he  said in that campaign, is when they asked what he would do when he was elected. Bill Buckley famously said: I will demand a recount. And that is a good message for all of us when we approach campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I continued to be involved with him in communication in many ways. My wife and I had the privilege of spending wonderful evenings with him and his late wife Patricia at their home in Stamford, CT. These were classic evenings of great food, some drink, and good spirited conversations--cigar and brandy to follow--but always open to ideas and always with a ready willingness to laugh. In fact, he passed away earlier today, apparently in his study in his magnificent home on Wallace Point in  Stamford, CT, probably working on a column or some other piece of writing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was particularly grateful to him for all that I learned from him, all the good times I had with him, and in some sense, you might say I would not be a United States Senator were it not for Bill Buckley, although Buckley would not say that. When I ran for the Senate in 1988, let's just say with the diplomacy that marks this Chamber that Bill Buckley was not a fan of the incumbent Republican Senator, and he called me up and said--I wish I could impersonate him--Joe, I'm thinking of endorsing  you. Do you think that will help?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: Well, now, that's very good of you. Then he interrupted and said: Please understand this is the only time I am likely to endorse your career. So I said that it probably would; what do you have in mind?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, he actually wrote a column, a very good column in the National Review, and I think in his syndicated column. He also, with the puckishness that was part of him, started something he called Buck PAC, which was, he said, a PAC open to anyone in Connecticut whose name was Buckley and who was committed to the defeat of the incumbent Senator at that time. He printed bumper stickers and the like and helped out in the campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said to him after I won that election--and I won it by very little--that I thought that in a close election--as the Presiding Officer of the Senate knows, there are so many reasons one is successful--but I said: You have reason, Bill, to take part of the credit. I won by less than 1 percent of the vote. And I said: You know, I would go so far as to say you played a rabbinical role for me in this campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, what do you mean by that? So I said: Your endorsement of me and the columns you wrote said to Republicans in Connecticut who really didn't like the incumbent Senator, it is kosher to vote for Lieberman. And he laughed. I remember that well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is so much I could say about his contribution to our country, to his openness to ideas, to his civility. One could disagree with Bill Buckley, as I did quite frequently, and never lose respect or affection, dare I say love, for a wonderful human being. We would all benefit from that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I perhaps would close this impromptu tribute to Bill Buckley, mourning his loss today, by offering condolences to his family: Chris Buckley, his son, who is a wonderful writer and confuses me as well as others with the multisyllabic words that he uses just as his father did; his sisters, Priscilla L. Buckley of Sharon, where the family has longed lived; Patricia Buckley Bozzell of Washington; Carol Buckley of Columbia, SC; his brothers, Judge James Buckley of Sharon, CT, and F. Reid Buckley of  Camden, SC; and a granddaughter and grandson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pray that they will be strengthened by their faith and comforted by good memories and pride and the extraordinary person in Bill Buckley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think most fitting of all, I will end with a quote from President Reagan on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the National Review in 1985. Reagan says when he first picked up his first issue of National Review, he received it in a plain brown wrapper and still anxiously awaited his biweekly edition but no longer in a plain brown wrapper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is what Reagan said of Buckley:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You didn't just part the Red Sea--you rolled it back, dried it up, and left exposed, for all the world to see, the naked desert that is statism. And then, as if that weren't enough, you gave the world something different, something in its weariness it desperately needed, the sound of laughter and the sight of the rich, green uplands of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to bid farewell in this Senate Chamber to a great American and a dear friend, William F. Buckley, Jr. I pray with confidence and the faith that Bill Buckley had that his soul will be taken up truly in the bonds of eternal life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
