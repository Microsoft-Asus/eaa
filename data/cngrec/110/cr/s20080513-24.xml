  <narrative>100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF BURLINGAME</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the 100th anniversary of the city of Burlingame, located in San Mateo County, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Burlingame was incorporated into the State of California on June 6, 1908. This year, we celebrate its centennial anniversary. Also known as the "City of Trees" because of its 18,000 public trees, the city of Burlingame has fascinated and charmed visitors for decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Situated in eastern San Mateo County near San Francisco Bay, Burlingame is named after diplomat Anson Burlingame, the former U.S. Minister to  China who stopped in the bay area on his way to China in 1866 and purchased 1,043 acres in what is currently Burlingame and Hillsborough. In the mid-1860s, a railroad line was built down the Peninsula, with many wealthy San Franciscans building secondary homes south of San Francisco. When the great earthquake devastated  much of San Francisco in 1906, many people looking to escape the dangers and hardships of the city also moved south, this time permanently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1894, the Burlingame Train Station was built to service the Burlingame Country Club, which was founded in 1893. This station, which was financed largely by country club members, was built to resemble the style of California's missions. Today, the Burlingame Train Station is on the National Register of Historic Places and has also been designated a State historic landmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 100 years, the city of Burlingame has not only served as a historical wonderland for those visiting the city but a place to call home for its more than 28,000 residents. I commend Burlingame for maintaining the natural beauty and historical significance of this fine city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Burlingame's vision and commitment to protecting its small piece of California history should be commended. I congratulate the city of Burlingame for its hard work on this special occasion and I look forward to future generations having the opportunity to visit and enjoy this unique city for another 100 years.</paragraph>
