    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my understanding, prior to my doing the closing--and I don't know if the distinguished Republican leader has anything today--it is my understanding that the Senator from Virginia wanted to make a statement. Does the Senator from Kentucky have anything to say?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may engage our respected leaders in a colloquy regarding the passage last night of the House supplemental. I am speaking for, I think, a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle, who have some thoughts with regard to how we proceed on the funding issue. I personally--speaking for myself--believe we should have no bifurcation of the funding and that it should all be acted upon at one time. I am very anxious that the tentative schedule of the leadership is before  Memorial Day. That is most important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope some of us could address the Senate and the leadership regarding the subject of benchmarks. I read with great interest that the President is openminded on the question of benchmarks. I believe it is important that, in September, General Petraeus is going to give us a report, together with the U.S. Ambassador, and presumably the Secretaries of State and Defense will join in that very important report to the Congress--indeed, to the whole country--with regard to the status of things in Iraq  in September. I do believe there is such a rapidly unfolding situation over there--we don't know from day to day how to anticipate certain things. Earlier this morning, General Mixon reported that he didn't have sufficient forces, U.S. forces and presumably Iraqi forces, to perform his mission in Diyala Province.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful, speaking for myself, that we can put in some language tied to benchmarks by which the President, before we go out on the August recess, would report to the Nation and to the Congress on his judgment as to whether there is progress on the benchmarks and whether he feels that in the July timeframe some change in strategy must be brought about in order to achieve the goals of the original strategy laid down on January 10 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My language would not have any obstruction to the flow of funds, but it would simply keep the Nation and the Congress fully informed of his judgment, together with his senior advisers, at that critical time before we go out on the August recess. I believe we have a responsibility, first and foremost, to the men and women in the Armed Forces, their families, and to the country for the Congress to watch this situation very closely and not defer until the September timeframe the concentrated judgment  that would  be brought to bear on the receiving of the report in September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To what extent can you advise us as to the process that might be followed in order to expeditiously get to the conference but at the same time either the conferees be informed of the views of others or we have some mechanism by which to address the issue?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are many issues--in fact, most issues that come before this body deal with monetary things, policy issues, which do not deal with the lives of our men and women in uniform. This issue does. I cannot speak for my Republican counterpart, Senator McConnell, but I can say without any question that I believe he and I are arm-locked in the recognition of how serious this is and how we have to do the very best the Senate can do. We are going to try to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a time when we have to work on a nonpartisan basis--not bipartisan but a nonpartisan basis--to get a matter to the House of Representatives so we can do a conference. At this stage, I have to say to my friend from Virginia, who is so knowledgeable about things military, we don't know how we are going to do that yet. That is a fair statement. Everything is on the table. But how we take things off the table and put certain things back on the table, I don't know at this stage. I don't think  my friend from Kentucky does, either, but we are open for suggestions and comments. It is not an easy situation. The House of Representatives is a different body than we are. The majority party there can do what they want to do. We cannot do that. This is the Senate, which is divided, as we speak, 50 to 49. So we have to work together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend that I understand his involvement in this. He has worked over the years very well with the Democrats. I look forward to that continuing during the supplemental appropriations bill. Speaking for me, I don't know how we are going to get there, but we are going to try. We have no choice. Failure is not an option.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, nobody has done more for his country, for the defense of this country, and for the Armed Forces of this country than the distinguished Senator from Virginia. We thank him for his ongoing advice about how to deal with this most difficult problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader and I are in exactly the same place. I believe the Senator from Virginia is as well. It is our great desire to get to conference and get a bill signed before Memorial Day. Exactly as the majority leader indicated, how we get from here to there is a matter under serious discussion between the two of us and with our members. So we will be working to get the job completed at the earliest possible opportunity.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I only add that I have been as critical of the President as anybody in the Senate. But I have to say that, in the last week or two, his spokesperson, his Chief of Staff, speaking with the authority of the President, has been available to Senator McConnell and me anytime I have asked. I appreciate that. If we are going to get this done, the President has to be part of the solution.</paragraph>
