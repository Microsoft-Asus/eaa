  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader and minority leader for allowing me to welcome and congratulate our guest chaplain today, Rev. Cathy Quinn, who has been noted as the senior assistant rector at St. John's Episcopal Church here in Washington, DC. That church, as my colleagues know, is also referred to occasionally as the Church of the Presidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Quinn plays an integral role in leading the congregation in their faith and spiritual growth. She is not new to Capitol Hill, having served as a legislative assistant for former New York Congressman Amo Houghton. Her experiences while at Yale Divinity School ranged from working at hospitals ministering to patients in the pediatric intensive care units and the oncology ward to assisting with the Children's Mission at St. Paul and St. James Episcopal Church. Her many accomplishments have  prepared her well for a life of ministry. Along with her growing number of ministerial duties at St. John's, Reverend Quinn also manages to balance the needs of her family--her husband Peter, who is in the Chamber today, and her two daughters, Nora and Molly. Her level of commitment to both aspects of her life is a model for many to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank Reverend Quinn for her contributions to her community and for her service to the members of St. John's Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish to acknowledge her good work and her spiritual guidance. I am particularly pleased because I have a parochial interest. As I said, not only  does my family belong to that church, but my wife Lilibet serves on the vestry there. So not only am I always tuned in, but I pay particular attention in this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we are very proud of her and the work she does, the work of St. John's, and all who are associated with that church and that ministry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
