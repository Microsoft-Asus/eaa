  <narrative>DO NOT REWARD COLOMBIA WITH A FAIR TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2123]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if I had been born in Colombia, I would probably be dead. As a former president of my labor union, my fight for higher wages, better working conditions, and secure pension could have cost me my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-nine trade unionists were murdered in Colombia in 2007, and they are being killed at a rate of over one per week this year. Even more alarming is only around 3 percent of cases result in convictions, illustrating the culture of violence that has existed in Colombia for decades. Inexplicably, President Bush wants to reward Colombia with a free trade agreement. Not on my watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The right to organize and bargain collectively is essential to human freedom and the passage of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement would greatly diminish our Nation's reputation as a leader in the fight to end human rights abuses worldwide. We should not even consider this agreement until Colombia puts a stop to the violence against union organizers.</paragraph>
