    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate an organization that has contributed to our community in my district in Michigan for something like 40 years, and has inspired us in many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Special Olympics is a beacon of opportunity and support for people with intellectual disabilities, providing training and athletic competition in over 100 countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michigan's 9th district, my district, is no exception. We have been blessed with a dedicated and vigilant local organization there that has established a successful program with amazing results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 400 athletes participated in this year's Oakland County Spring Games this past May, including Charles Howard from Farmington and Jaime Bonneau from Clarkston, who have been selected to compete in the World Games in 2009. I extend my best wishes to their respective competitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 40th anniversary of this extraordinary organization, I wish to honor them for their efforts and their contributions to our community and the communities around the Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
