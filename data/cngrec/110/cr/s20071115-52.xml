    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Kelli Van Steenwyk for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects her hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role she has played in giving back to her local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kelli Van Steenwyk with Hub Area Habitat for Humanity is employed by Wells Fargo Financial and gathered building and committee assistance for Hub Area Habitat for Humanity. Kelli recruited the support of 12 other co-workers. Working alongside Kirstie Hoon, Kelli has shown great leadership. Her fundraising committee has been successful at contributing greatly to Hub Area Habitat for Humanity activities. Kelli is a valuable supporter of the Aberdeen community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Kelli Van Steenwyk and to congratulate her on receiving this well-earned award and wish her continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
