  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is the first year that the Democrats have controlled Congress in a long time, and we are dedicated to bringing a budget to the floor next week that balances the budget within the next 5 years without any new taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, the President made the same pledge. Unfortunately, earlier this month the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the President's budget and says that it falls short by 2012. Since taking office, this has been a difficult proposed budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only does the President's budget remain in the red for the next 5 years, but he also proposes raising taxes on some of the middle-class families. The President's health care proposal would result in a tax increase of $500 billion over 10 years by increasing taxes on middle-class families who are fortunate to have employer-provided health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Democrats propose a budget that is balanced by 2012, and a budget that is balanced without raising taxes.</paragraph>
