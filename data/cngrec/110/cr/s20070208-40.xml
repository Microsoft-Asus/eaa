    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Super Bowl Champions from my home State of Indiana, the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts' 29-17 historic win over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI was the first professional football championship for the State of Indiana and a proud moment for our State and country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Tony Dungy hoisted the Lombardi Trophy high into the rainy Miami night, the first African American coach to do so, I was reminded of what people used to say about the great Joe Louis: "He is a testament to his race, the human race." This was a great moment for African Americans but one that we all should take pride in. Tony Dungy, Peyton Manning, Jim Irsay, and the entire Colts team and organization are a testament to what professional athletes should be, and they should be commended for  winning with class, courage, and character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is rare in today's sports world that an organization carries itself with such character and class, on and off the field. Throughout the year, the Colts battled week after week, fighting uphill, and never buckling under the pressure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the playoffs started, the Colts' true character shined even brighter. They never lost faith in themselves and prevailed as a team. Their conduct this season should be an example for all other teams, not an exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget sitting with my two young boys cheering as our team won the Super Bowl, but it was just as important that they got to see professional athletes carry themselves with such integrity. I congratulate the Indianapolis Colts on their Super Bowl victory and for the example they set for my children and the millions of others who I hope are inspired by their example.</paragraph>
