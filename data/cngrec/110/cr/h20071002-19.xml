    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, Congress passed legislation, of course, to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's a bipartisan bill, provides health coverage to 10 million low-income Americans. It's fully paid for, no change in eligibility requirements. And the President says he's going to veto it because it's going to lead to "socialized medicine."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've had children who have received access to doctors for years. Many States have done it on their own. The Federal Government has supported it with the children's health care initiative. And what's happened? Children have been able to see a doctor. Parents have gone to bed at night with the confidence that if their child was sick they'd have access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is bipartisan. Republican Senator Susan Collins said, "I can't believe the President would veto a program that benefits low-income children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charles Grassley: "The President's understanding of our bill is wrong. I urge him to reconsider."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Hatch: "We're talking about kids who basically don't have coverage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No justification for this veto, Mr. President. Change your mind.</paragraph>
