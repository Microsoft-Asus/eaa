  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="HONORING MESA STUDENTS">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize six of New Mexico's youth who have participated in a national Mathematics, Engineering, Science and Achievement, MESA, USA competition. The competition held at the University of Maryland focused on physics this year and New Mexico had one team from middle school and one team from high school participating. Every participating team made a Trebuchet, or catapult with weight on one end and a projectile on the other. The teams were judged  on accuracy, distance, and design.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four students from Sarracino Middle School in Socorro won the middle school division of the Jamboree State-wide competition held at the University of New Mexico. After winning there, they competed at the University of Maryland and took the third place position for all middle school participants at the national MESA USA competition. Sam Hale, Daniel Jaramillo, Tyler Lam, and Jordan Vinson, all eighth graders, proved with their teamwork that they were a force to be reckoned with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two Belen High School graduates also represented New Mexico well at the competition. Samantha Huynh and Matthew Swanson won the high school division of the Jamboree State-wide competition held at the University of New Mexico. They, too, participated in the national competition in Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am always proud to learn of students such as these who have taken their learning in the classroom to another level. These sorts of competitions allow students to think outside the box and come up with new solutions to old problems. Problem-solving skills, such as these displayed during the competition, prove to be invaluable for this Nation's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations again. I know these future leaders will accomplish great things.</paragraph>
