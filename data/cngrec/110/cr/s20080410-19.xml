  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask that the Chair let me know when 2 minutes remain because Senator Kyl may be back as a cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Alexander-Kyl amendment No. 4429, which we hope is a helpful amendment to the Ensign-Cantwell amendment. Let me try to say this in two different ways. If you care about climate change, here is what our amendment will do. It will extend from 1 year to 2 the production tax credit for all qualified renewable sources of electricity. In other words, these emerging renewable energies, which have the capacity to work 24 hours a day, would have 2 years, as well as  wind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it would mean that wind would not get all the money but that some others would have more time to respond to the incentives we are creating with these tax credits. Let me use a story to illustrate. Let's say a family has several children. One of them older. Dad calls a meeting and says: I have $3 billion extra, which is the amount of money we are talking about for the Ensign-Cantwell amendment. Let's give it to the overgrown son who is still living at home who has gotten most of the allowance  money for the last 16 years. Let's give him another year. Mom, who is a little wiser, says: It is nice for you to want to give an allowance to the children, but what about all these other children--open-loop biomass and small irrigation power and landfill gas and trash combustion. Instead of giving all the money to the son living at home, let's give some to all the children, including the overgrown son. That is what we would do if we adopt the Alexander-Kyl amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Energy Information Administration, the production tax credit Senator Ensign wants to extend for a year, 97 percent of it went to wind in Fiscal Year 2007, which has gotten most of our renewable electricity tax credit money since 1992. So the Ensign-Cantwell amendment is being advertised as helping renewable energy. It adds another $3 billion over the next 10 years to the $11 billion we have already invested in wind and these other promising children. Wind only works  when it wants to. These emerging technologies might work when they are told to. We would like to include them. Wind would still get more of the money than anybody else, but it would not get 97 percent. It would not get almost all of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another reason to favor the Alexander-Kyl amendment. That would be if you care about the spending of tax dollars. According to the Energy Information Administration, we spend 53 more times per megawatt hour on wind than we do on coal in subsidies, and coal provides half our electricity. We spend 94 more times on wind per hour than we do on natural gas which produces clean electricity; 15 times more on wind per megawatt hour than we do on nuclear; 26 more per megawatt hour than we do  on biomass; 25 times more than we do on geothermal; 35 times more than we do on hydroelectric; 17 times more than we do on landfill gas. We spend 27 times more per megawatt hour to subsidize wind, a proven technology that only works when it wants to, than we do on all the other renewables, 27 to 1. That is not a wise use of tax dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We urge support for the Alexander-Kyl amendment so these technologies, and wind as well, will have a 2-year extension of the tax credit instead of 1 and so all these promising children can help with climate change and clean air rather than giving all the money to one overgrown son who ought to be out on his own by now.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when 2 1/2  minutes remain. First, I'd like to thank Senator Cantwell for her leadership in the last few weeks that we have worked together on drafting a bipartisan compromise making sure that we help renewable energy become more of the power supply to the United States. We all believe from an economic standpoint, that it will help create jobs and new technologies as well as help the economy not only now, but into the future. Renewable  energy helps the environment. It is cleaner than fossil fuels and makes us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. A lot of the money we send overseas is to folks who are not exactly friendly to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ensign-Cantwell amendment is supported by a broad range of industries as well as environmental groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following two letters of support be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>OF MANUFACTURERS,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, April 8, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR: On behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade association representing small and large manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states, I urge you to support the Cantwell-Ensign Clean Energy Tax Stimulus amendment number 4419 to <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, housing legislation currently being considered on the Senate floor. This amendment would, among other provisions, extend incentives for clean and renewable energy that  are set to expire at the end of this year.</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. manufacturers, large and small, have a substantial concern for affordable domestic energy supplies and improved energy efficiency. As a key component to reducing energy demand, increasing energy efficiency will go a long way to lowering energy costs and increasing economic competitiveness. By promoting energy efficiency and the development of renewable and alternative energy sources, the package of incentives included in the Cantwell-Ensign amendment represents an important step in securing  our nation's energy security without raising taxes.</narrative>
  <narrative>The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that votes on the amendment offered by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and John Ensign (R-NV) will be considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the NAM voting record for the 110th Congress. Eligibility for the NAM Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence will be based on a member's record on Key Manufacturing Votes.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your consideration.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

  <narrative>AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL,</narrative>
  <narrative>Arlington, VA, April 4, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR CANTWELL AND SENATOR ENSIGN: The American Chemistry Council wishes to convey its strong support for the "Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act of 2008," (<bill type="s" number="2821">S. 2821</bill>), introduced yesterday by you and cosponsored by a large bipartisan group of Senators. The ACC has long advocated for a balanced portfolio of energy policies that advance energy efficiency, fuel diversity, and new supply sources. <bill type="s" number="2821">S. 2821</bill>, in its current form, contains a number of critical and cost effective energy efficiency  and energy production incentives. We urge the Senate to take up the measure quickly and approve it without attaching any of the controversial "pay for" provisions that have prevented the passage of these beneficial incentives in the past.</narrative>
  <narrative>The members of the ACC use natural energy resources to make the products that allow our customers to save energy. The products of chemistry go into energy-saving materials used throughout the economy, such as insulation, weatherization equipment, lightweight vehicle parts, lubricants, coatings, energy efficient appliances, solar parts and windmill blades. For example, the use of just one product, insulation in buildings, results in a net benefit to society of 40 BTUs of energy saved for every  BTU used to produce the product. We applaud the provisions of the bill that would encourage the use of energy efficient products.</narrative>
  <narrative>Similarly, we appreciate that this bill does not include provisions that would increase tax burden on the oil and gas industry, which is a key supplier to and a customer of the American chemical industry. As you know, worldwide demand for energy has pushed our industries power and feedstock prices to dangerously high levels. In the first half of the  decade our fuel and feedstock costs have increased by more than $100 billion. Our global competitors do  not face similar cost pressures. Our vital industry has lost $60 billion in business to overseas competitors and more than 110,000 high-paying jobs have disappeared. Additional taxes on the companies supplying these feedstocks will increase costs to our industry, result</narrative>
  <narrative>The American Chemistry Council urges the Senate to pass <bill type="s" number="2821">S. 2821</bill>, as it is a critical plank in a broader energy policy platform, and for you to strenuously resist including tax increases that constrain the supply of feedstocks that the industry needs to competitively make our energy efficiency products.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Jack N. Gerard,</narrative>

    <paragraph>It is supported by everybody from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Real Estate Roundtable, the American Chemistry Council, the Sierra Club, the National Resources Defense Council, as well as hundreds of other businesses and organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This, however, is a delicate compromise. Three times in the past there have been attempts to pass a renewable energy bill. They have all failed. This is our chance to actually pass something that can be signed into law. Unfortunately, the Alexander amendment would break the delicate balance. We need to defeat the Alexander amendment and pass the Ensign-Cantwell amendment if we truly want to encourage renewables into the marketplace in a much larger way in the United States. It is good for the  country, good for the environment, and good for the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a defeat of the Alexander amendment and adoption of the Ensign-Cantwell amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Cantwell.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>How much time remains?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is 2 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Alexander amendment. Along with my colleague from Nevada, we reached a very delicate balance to get this legislation where it is today. I would hate to see that balance disturbed by the proposal the Senator from Tennessee is offering about wind. The reality is our nation is still only producing a small percentage of renewable energy, and we could produce much more. To curtail investment in one of the most promising renewable technologies  at this point would be premature. We have to realize what we are trying to do is create continued incentives not just for the long-term, and this legislation is aimed at saving this year's investment cycle. If the Senator from Tennessee wants to have a discussion later about long-term clean energy investments and what that horizon should be, this Senator is more than happy to talk to him about that. But this amendment before us is about the near term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that we are trying to do is create stimulus for this year, we are trying to save the investment in the production tax credits, the investment tax credits, and efficiency tax credits. For example, PG&amp;E has proposed purchasing 553 megawatts of power, which is the size of a typical natural gas or coal plant, from a concentrating solar facility in the Mojave Desert. If we don't pass this legislation, we are going to lose about $1.5 to $2 billion in investment and a big opportunity  to increase the tax base of San Bernardino County, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example, Butte, MT, has one of the largest polysilicon plants in the world, producing feedstock material for solar panels. Expansion of this plant, an investment over $1 billion, is on hold because we haven't given predictability in the tax code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing this amendment will also give consumers efficiency credits of up to $500. Using that credit on insulation for example could save homeowners over 20 percent on their annual heating and cooling bills. The production tax credits in the underlying Ensign amendment, not the Alexander amendment, as a result in the next 3 to 5 years, we will have enough green renewable power to power 35 cities the size of Seattle. If we agree to the Ensign amendment instead of the Alexander amendment, with the  investment tax credit, it will build enough solar power, and 1.1 million homes could instead have the power of solar and more renewable green energy. I encourage my colleagues to turn down the Alexander amendment and vote for the Ensign amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it has been written that King of England Edward I--known as the "Hammer of the Scots"--once tried to prohibit London's burning of coal. He is said to have proclaimed, "Be it known to all within the sound of my voice, whoever shall be found guilty of burning coal shall suffer the loss of his head."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal has always had its critics. Despite them, coal has not only endured, it has prevailed. It fueled America's Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. It fueled America's naval battleships in the early 20th century. It possesses the bright potential to help America get out from under the thumb of foreign oil-wielding despots in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coal industry has evolved in the last centuries, shaped by safety and environmental critiques. It has professed a willingness to evolve further. But the harsh attacks and efforts to demonize coal on the campaign trail are becoming increasingly irresponsible and inflammatory, and destructive. Coal miners hear these comments, and what are they to think? They are patriotic Americans. They risk their lives every day underground. They reside in the coalfields, where they live honest, modest lives,  and where they attend church and teach their children solid values. And they vote. The last thing they deserve is to have their profession--or to have their father's profession--demonized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These kinds of comments are counterproductive to the challenges that lie in front of us. If our Nation is to regain its independence from foreign oil, we must rely on coal. There is no getting around that reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal produces half of the electricity consumed by the American people. It is a cheap, abundant resource in a time when the American people demand stable, reliable energy prices. The U.S. military is already making long-term investments in liquid-coal technology. The chunk of rock that once burned in a stove will soon be widely used in fuel tanks of aircrafts, cars, trucks, and buses, and just about anything else we need it for. Coal will be around for a long, long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support a broad energy portfolio. Renewable energies have their place in that portfolio, but they are not a panacea. Certainly one renewable energy alone, like wind, will not guarantee our Nation's energy independence. We need to expand our use of other renewable and alternative fuels. Solar is important, geothermal is showing promise, tidal has great possibilities, and biomass--particularly when combined with coal to help immediately reduce emissions that concern us all--is certainly a fuel  worth investing in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to me that the intent of the Ensign/Cantwell amendment is good, but the benefit of the Alexander amendment is greater. And so I will cast my vote with those who seek a broader investment in renewable energies that is also grounded in the realities of the continuing promise of coal.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Ensign-Cantwell amendment to the housing bill. This amendment extends expiring tax credits for renewable energy production and development and tax credits for energy efficient homes and buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be perfectly clear. I fully support extending these tax credits. I voted for them last December when we tried to attach them to the Energy bill. I supported them again when we considered the economic stimulus package in February. I am in fact an original cosponsor of the freestanding legislation this amendment is based on. I have long argued that we have a responsibility to put our nation on a path toward energy independence. In addition to making us better stewards of the environment,  this is also vitally important to protecting our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels. Done responsibly, it can also spur economic growth and create tens of thousands of new good-paying green collar jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I felt compelled to oppose the Ensign-Cantwell proposal as an  amendment to the housing bill. In my view, however, the housing bill simply was the wrong legislative vehicle for this initiative. As I have said many times, nearly 8,000 people every day are facing foreclosure--8,000 people every single day are losing their homes and must cope with uncertain and difficult financial futures for themselves and their families. Working this week with  Senator Shelby, the majority and minority leaders, and others, I felt it my responsibility to shepherd through a basic set of policies that will help mitigate this housing crisis. This bill did clearly not include everything I would have liked, but it provides a critical first step, and it was imperative in my view that we act quickly to stem this national housing crisis without being sidelined by other matters, regardless of their merit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank my colleagues Senator Cantwell and Senator Ensign for their commitment to clean, renewable energy and their leadership on the issue. For the reasons I have given, I wish this proposal could have been advanced differently. However, I remain committed to working with them and all the Members of this body to achieve the goal of energy independence.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="NATIONAL ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me emphasize this point. No. 1, the Alexander-Kyl amendment has more certainty. It extends the production tax credit from 1 year to 2 for all these. Second, the distinguished Senator from Washington mentioned solar power. Solar asked to be out of the production tax credit 3 years ago because all the money in the production tax credit was going to wind. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, I was the lead sponsor of the amendment adding the investment tax credit for  solar power. No one loses under the Alexander amendment No. 4429, except wind is treated similar to everybody else. It gets 1 cent per kilowatt hour. That means it will still get more of the money than anybody in the production tax credit. But open-loop biomass, all these emerging renewable technologies will</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in a short while, the Senate will be voting to approve <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the Foreclosure Prevention Act. It is a good bill with some good provisions; namely, $10 billion for mortgage revenue bonds, $4 billion for community development block grants, and $200 million for foreclosure prevention counseling. I regret, however, that we missed two opportunities to make it even better. The first missed opportunity was our failure to adopt Senator Durbin's provision regarding  bankruptcy. I am still mystified why a bankruptcy judge can reduce the principal or modify the mortgage loan terms on a vacation home but not on a primary residence. The second missed opportunity, in my estimation, was our inability to adopt an amendment Senator Ensign and I offered to establish a $7,000 nonrefundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers. I regret that the Parliamentarian ruled our amendment out of order and we never had a chance to vote on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment Senator Ensign and I offered was timely, targeted, and temporary: eligibility for the credit would be phased out for single filers whose adjusted gross income, AGI, is between $70,000 and $90,000; for married couples filing a joint return, eligibility for the credit would be phased out if their AGI is between $110,000 and $130,000. These phase-out levels are identical to the phase-out levels contained in the District of Columbia's first-time homebuyers' tax credit. The  credit would be available only for the purchase of a primary residence made within 1 year of the date of enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to encourage prospective buyers to get off the sidelines and back into the market. An important segment of that population--39 percent nationwide--consists of first-time homebuyers. Recently, first-time homebuyers have accounted for 65 to 67 percent of sales in Baltimore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The District of Columbia had a similar tax credit and it worked. Through the end of last year, first-time homebuyers who purchased a home in the District were eligible for a $5,000 tax credit. The credit helped 3,000 to 4,000 people become home owners each year, and it boosted buyers' interest in neighborhoods where home ownership rates lagged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this amendment, if adopted, would have made a good bill better. I hope the House will incorporate a first-time homebuyers' tax credit provision in its version of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>I would like to associate myself with the remarks from the junior Senator from Maryland regarding the Cardin-Ensign first-time homebuyers' tax credit amendment. We worked together as members of the House Ways &amp; Means Committee and I was pleased to be able to work with him again on this amendment here in the Senate. The foreclosure problem is particularly acute in Nevada; in fact, we have the highest rate of foreclosures in the Nation. Last year, according to RealtyTrac.com, we had  66,316 foreclosure filings--a 215 percent increase over 2006 and a 760-percent increase over 2005. We have nearly 35,000 properties in foreclosure, which is 3.4 percent of all households. This tidal wave of economic misfortune is swamping the housing market in my home State. The amendment Senator Cardin and I offered would have helped to stabilize the market and I am disappointed that the Senate didn't have a chance to vote on it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>I would say to my colleagues from Maryland and Nevada that I, too, think that in the current economy, a temporary tax credit is a meritorious idea. I commend the Senators for working so hard on their amendment and I can understand their disappointment. It appears that, yesterday, the Ways and Means Committee adopted a credit more along the lines the Senators have proposed. I look forward to working with the House in a conference to craft a homebuyer tax credit that will help the housing  market recover. There are many things we can and should do to help homeowners and a targeted, temporary homebuyer credit is one of them.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is a justifiable feeling of anger and worry across America today regarding the ongoing housing crisis. Millions of Americans are currently bearing a heavy burden to keep their family homes and desperate for relief. The clamor for the Federal Government to act quickly has been heard by the Senate and we are now set to vote on a bipartisan package that will offer some assistance to suffering homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without action, the pain of the foreclosure crisis will not only be felt by the millions of American families who stand to lose their homes but by all Americans. Congress must confront this reality and pass legislation that has three key components: it is temporary in nature, has an immediate goal of helping cash-strapped but credit-worthy home owners stay in their homes, and prevents a mortgage crisis from happening again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before the Senate is not perfect, but it does contain several provisions that I support and believe can help our housing market--for both mortgage borrowers and lenders--now and in the future. It is important to avoid situations in which homeowners owe more money than their home is worth. Unfortunately, that has become too common a scenario in part because many homeowners never had much equity in their home to begin with. This bill contains a provision that would ensure homeowners avoid  this situation by requiring a modest increase in the downpayment necessary for Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages. This legislation can also offer some relief to borrowers by increasing the amount of FHA-insured loans, which typically carry lower interest rates. Additionally, it is also vital to have well-informed borrowers who understand the terms and obligations in a mortgage agreement and provide lenders</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am supporting this bill and thank its bipartisan sponsors. However, I do want the record to be clear that I remain concerned over the inclusion of several provisions that do not adhere to my principles for mortgage relief and question the effectiveness of these provisions in delivering needed assistance to home owners. Mr. President, again, I thank those who have worked so hard on this measure on both sides of the aisle, and I look forward to acting on this important subject.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate threw a lifeline to homeowners facing the specter of foreclosure. This legislation includes valuable resources for communities, homeowners, and industry to combat the downturn in the housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Wisconsin, foreclosures have risen at an alarming rate. Compared to last year, foreclosures have increased by 145 percent. Many of these foreclosed properties were connected with subprime loans with adjusting interest rates. A combination of lax lending standards and the creation of exotic financial products gave lenders the ability to offer people who would not qualify before the chance to own a home. However, there was little concern on whether or not the person or family  would be able to sustain home ownership. Because of the irresponsibility of some lenders, families across the country have lost their homes and more are soon to follow if help does not come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the provisions included in the Foreclosure Prevention Act increases funds for housing counseling services. These nonprofit housing counseling agencies help homeowners connect to their lenders and renegotiate terms that will allow them to keep their homes. The money is estimated to help close to 500,000 families stay in their homes. Another very important provision provides $4 billion in community development block grant for communities to purchase and redevelop foreclosed-upon properties.  This will enable localities to purchase unoccupied  properties which drag down neighboring home prices and are easy targets for criminal activity. By rehabilitating these blights, communities will be able to prevent further loss of property value while at the same</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The housing crisis has shed light on the complexity and problems in our Nation's lending system. Many homeowners were rushed through the process without truly understanding the terms and conditions of their loans. The Foreclosure Prevention Act will amend the Truth in Lending Act to require lenders to fully disclose the terms and conditions of the loan and to provide the home buyer with the maximum loan payment they will have to make. This simple change will enable future home buyers to make  informed decisions regarding their mortgage and enable them to plan accordingly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill is not the final answer to the housing crisis, it is a step in the right direction. There are still many issues that need to be resolved in order to avoid a similar housing and economic downturn. We must consider revising lending standards to protect future home buyers, increasing our affordable rental housing stock and ensuring we create sound fiscal policies that promote the economic well-being of each and every American.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the legislation currently before the Senate. The Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 seeks to provide assistance to families and businesses adversely affected by the decline of the values of real estate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support many of the worthy initiatives in this bill, such as the Federal Housing Authority modernization provisions and other resources to assist communities devastated by foreclosures, there are several provisions that cause me to withhold my support at this time. I note that the bill will go to a conference committee with the House of Representatives, and subsequent to their work, I will revisit this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America, our Republic, rests on basic and time tested principles. Among them is our free enterprise system. The foundation of this system must not be unduly influenced from excessive government interference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, while this legislation contains a number of worthy initiatives, respectfully, in my view, this legislation as a whole overreaches and fails this basic test.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 because it provides targeted relief to homeowners facing foreclosure and communities dealing with the negative effects of increasing numbers of foreclosures. Unfortunately, this bill also includes provisions that would not provide assistance to those most in need and it is my hope that those provisions will be modified or removed during the conference process. While I have reservations about some of the provisions in  this bill, on balance, the legislation takes a step towards addressing some of the problems in the housing industry by increasing mortgage disclosures provided to borrowers and providing more housing counseling to homeowners facing foreclosure. I hope as Congress moves forward on this bill and other related housing measures we make sure that the legislation is crafted to help those most in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is estimated that at least 2 million Americans may face foreclosure on their homes in the coming months and years, which will not only have a devastating impact for those individual families, but will also have significant negative impact on the communities in which those homes are located. Various cities report that increased numbers of foreclosures and the concentration of foreclosures in certain neighborhoods can lead to increased instances of vandalism, crime, and theft. We need to act  now to provide assistance that will help keep American families in their homes both for the good of those families and also for the good of whole neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Wisconsin has not been as hard hit as other regions of the country, foreclosures are in the rise in the state and a number of Wisconsinites have told me about their concerns about the effects of rising number of foreclosures on communities around the state. I have heard from local government officials who are concerned about holding lenders accountable for maintaining abandoned homes and ensuring the abandoned homes do not fall into disrepair. I have heard from housing advocates concerned  about borrowers who may have been misled into taking out a subprime loan and now face the prospect of losing their homes. And I have heard from dedicated lawyers and counselors who are trying to provide counseling and other services in order to help individual and families through these tough times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If these personal stories are not enough to urge us to act, available foreclosure data should also move us to take steps to address the rising number of foreclosures around our country. One report, by the Center for Responsible Lending, looks at the effects of subprime loans issued in 2005 and 2006 throughout the Nation, including in Wisconsin. According to the center's analysis, there were over</paragraph>
    <paragraph>60,000 subprime loans issued in 2005 and 2006 in Wisconsin and close to 12,000 of these homes financed by a subprime loan during those years may be foreclosed upon. Additionally, the foreclosures from these subprime loans may result in over 550,000 surrounding homes in my State of Wisconsin experiencing a decline in their value. These statistics are alarming and unfortunately are replicated in States around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does take some good steps towards trying to address the rising number of foreclosures around the country. I am pleased that this bill includes an additional $150 million in housing counseling funds for 2008 and $30 million to provide legal services to homeowners dealing with the possible foreclosure of their homes. These funds are to be used to assist families facing foreclosure reach agreements with their lenders so that they can remain in their homes while also making reasonable payments  on the amount owed on the home. Congress appropriated funding for counseling services as part of the fiscal year 2008 omnibus appropriations bill and reports indicate that these funds are a cost-effective use of Federal resources. I am disappointed that the Senate did not provide the full $200 million in housing counseling</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also pleased to support the increased Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, funds that were included in the Foreclosure Prevention Act. CDBG is an immensely popular Federal program that provides a flexible source of funding for States and local governments to address the unique problems facing their communities. States and localities will be able to use these CDBG funds for a variety of purposes including: establishing methods to purchase foreclosed homes, rehabbing these homes in order  to sell or rent them out, and demolishing foreclosed homes that are contributing to neighborhood blight. The increased number of foreclosures is impacting States and local communities in unique ways, and providing flexibility in the use of these CDBG funds is essential to help communities make the best possible use of this money. I was particularly pleased that the negotiators of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The additional mortgage disclosures included in this package will do much to help ensure that future borrowers, whether taking out a first mortgage or refinancing their existing mortgages, better know the terms of the mortgages and how much  they can expect to pay every month. While it is true that some borrowers fully knew that they  were getting in over their heads when they took out mortgages, other borrowers did not understand the terms of their loans or were misled by lenders. The changes that this legislation makes to the Truth in Lending Act, TILA, will help to prevent some of the egregious lending practices that have gone on in the past from occurring again. While this provision is  a good step forward, much more needs to be done to rein in predatory lending. I hope that the Senate can move quickly on comprehensive predatory lending legislation this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there were some tax provisions included in this legislation that will not directly help families and individuals facing foreclosure on their homes. I am particularly disappointed that the single largest provision in the bill is a tax break that bails out some of those businesses whose actions helped aggravate the housing crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also disappointed that the Senate voted to table the Durbin amendment which would have removed a provision in bankruptcy law that prevents mortgages on primary residences from being modified during bankruptcy. According to advocates, the Durbin amendment could have helped approximately 600,000 individuals or families remain in their homes. It is the single most effective thing that could be done to reduce foreclosures. Unfortunately, this amendment faced stiff resistance in the lending  community, even though mortgages on vacation homes and luxury items such as yachts can be modified in bankruptcy under current law. Senator Durbin even worked to narrow the amendment to address some of the lenders' concerns. Even after these reasonable modifications, the lending community remained opposed to the amendment, and the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the renewable energy amendment offered by Senators Ensign and Cantwell, while I continue to support extending critical renewable energy tax provisions, I am disappointed that this amendment was not offset. I also oppose the amendment's section 105 language. It unfortunately does not reflect the latest compromise reached within both the House and Senate as reflected in <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which passed the House on December 2, 2007; S. Amdt 3841, which I supported on December  13, 2007; and <bill type="h" number="5351">H.R. 5351</bill>. I am pleased, however, that Senator Cantwell has committed to working with me to ensure this provision is fixed to correct its overly broad definition, which poses a unique but serious threat to Wisconsin. Unless modified, the bill's language could have the unintended consequence of penalizing Wisconsin, which has a unique,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have reservations about some of the provisions in this bill, but I will support the final bill because the bill does provide some important assistance to individuals and communities and it is important that we get the CDBG and housing counseling funds to States and local communities as soon as possible. The high number of foreclosures around our country has caused much suffering among individual homeowners and throughout local communities and we need to take action now to help these homeowners  and communities rebuild their lives and neighborhoods. I hope that this bill can be improved during conference negotiations and that Congress will address the unresolved housing issues we face, including the need for stronger predatory lending laws and the need for more affordable housing for low income Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. I thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby for their work to develop a meaningful bill to help address the housing crisis in our country. Too many working families are losing their homes, credit access has been significantly reduced, and our economy has slowed. This act will help alleviate the challenges faced by homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hawaii's foreclosure rate increased by more than 88 percent last year, for a total of 1,270 families who had their homes foreclosed. The loss of a family home can be financially and emotionally devastating. Compared with other States, Hawaii has not suffered as much during this housing crisis. However, foreclosure statistics do not reflect the many families who are having difficulties making mortgage payments after their adjustable interest rate mortgage reset or having to sell at a significant  loss due to an unexpected transfer or a loss of a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This much needed bipartisan legislation will help protect homeowners across the country, prevent foreclosures, and assist our Nation's veterans. This legislation will modernize and improve the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, to provide homeowners with additional access to fixed rate mortgages. Additional resources will be provided by this bill for housing counseling to assist homeowners in finding solutions to their difficult situations. In addition, mortgage disclosures will be made more  meaningful to consumers by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also appreciate the inclusion of a provision that is derived from legislation that I introduced last month, <bill type="s" number="2768">S. 2768</bill>. That legislation would correct an oversight in the Economic Stimulus Act and extend the temporary home loan guaranty increase to veterans so that more of them can realize the dream of home ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VA Home Loan Guaranty was part of the original GI bill in 1944. It was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and provided veterans with a federally guaranteed home loan with no down payment. So as World War II was ending, landmark legislation made the dream of home ownership a reality for millions of returning veterans. Today, more than 25 million veterans and servicemembers are eligible for VA home loan guarantees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amount of the home loan guaranty was last adjusted by the Veterans Benefits Act of 2004. The maximum guaranty amount was increased to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit determined under section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act for a single family residence, as adjusted for the year involved. Using that formula, since the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit for a single family residence in 2008 is $417,000, VA will guarantee a veteran's loan up to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The newly enacted Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, however, temporarily reset the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA home loan guarantee limits to 125 percent of metropolitan-area median home prices, without reference to the VA home loan program. This had the effect of raising the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits to nearly $730,000 in the highest cost areas, while leaving the VA limit of $417,000 in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure so that this important group of Americans may benefit from an increased home loan guaranty in this time of economic uncertainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would also increase benefits for specially adapted housing for disabled veterans. This legislation would authorize VA to pay an additional $10,000 to those eligible for assistance pursuant to section 2101(a), title 38, United States Code, increasing the total amount of funds available per grant to $60,000. Individuals eligible for assistance pursuant to section 2101(b) would be able to receive an additional $2,000 in assistance, increasing the total amount of funds available  per grant to $12,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increases in housing and home adaptation grants have been infrequent, despite the fact that real estate and construction costs are continually on the  rise. Unless the amounts of the grants are adjusted, inflation erodes the value and effectiveness of these benefits, making it more difficult for beneficiaries to afford the accommodations they need. This provision would go a long way in making certain that specially adapted housing benefits meet the current  needs of America's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must enact this legislation quickly to help homeowners remain in their homes, stabilize the economy, and provide much needed improvements to veterans' housing benefits.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the progress this bill represents is overdue. The foreclosure crisis is dire, and there is much still to be done. But this bill offers some immediate help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few months, I have hosted a series of roundtable meetings in Michigan communities with leaders from local and State government, as well as organizations that are in the trenches working with families facing foreclosure, to discuss practical ways to help homeowners and protect our economy from further damage. When I have asked for their feedback on this bill, they think it would help address a number of the problems they highlighted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across Michigan, communities would like to rehabilitate abandoned and foreclosed properties so that surrounding property values do not continue to fall. But currently there are not funds to meet the growing demand. This bill provides Federal block grants to areas with the highest foreclosure rates and filings to help rehabilitate abandoned or foreclosed properties and prevent further damage to local housing values and neighborhoods. In addition, taxpayers who purchase a home that has been foreclosed  upon will be eligible for a tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also provides funding for much needed pre-foreclosure counseling. I am encouraged by the good work currently being done by many counseling organizations who are trying to help families avoid foreclosure. But across Michigan, foreclosure prevention counselors are overwhelmed, and a lack of funds is tying the hands of local groups trying to help keep families on track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also helps address the critical need for more affordable loans to help families refinance and stay in their current homes. States are authorized to issue new tax-exempt bonds to help homeowners refinance adjustable rate mortgages. Providing refinancing options for homeowners in potentially solvent situations is an important component in the effort to reverse the current tide of foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ending the foreclosure crisis will require a team effort among Federal, State, and local governments, community and neighborhood organizations, and lenders, brokers, and borrowers. This bill recognizes that fact. It provides an opportunity to help keep struggling families in their homes. It provides an opportunity to help restore our housing markets by keeping declining property values stable. It will protect neighborhoods from a glut of vacant homes. There is much more we need to do, but this  bill represents a long overdue start. I am hopeful that an even stronger version will return quickly to the Senate from a House/Senate conference committee so we can get much-needed help to people in Michigan as soon as possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to have worked with my colleague Chuck Grassley on the important tax relief measures in this bill. They will help homeowners, homebuyers, and homebuilders. And I urge my colleagues to support them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax provisions in the bill come to a little over $10 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill creates a standard property tax deduction for homeowners who do not itemize their Federal taxes. And that deduction will help low- and middle-income homeowners to afford to keep their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill increases funding for mortgage revenue bonds. And those bonds will help homeowners and homebuyers to obtain affordable loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides a substantial credit to buyers of foreclosed homes. And that credit will help to stabilize local markets and restore property values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill allows companies losing money--and laying off employees--to write off current losses and bolster struggling operations. And that ability to carry over losses will help struggling companies to keep workers on the payroll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no magic solution to this housing crisis. This bill is just plain responsible policy. It addresses a lot of irresponsible actions that led to serious trouble for many Americans and for our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To respond to this crisis, Senator Grassley and I crafted provisions that support American families and American workers. These folks deserve to keep their homes. And they deserve to keep their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will put real money in their pockets. It will do so through tax relief. And it will do so through continued paychecks from companies that use the tax relief in the bill to survive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let's send it to the House. Let's send its tax relief to American homeowners, homebuyers, and homebuilders. And let's speed this help to American families and American workers.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS' TAX CREDIT">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the U.S. Senate will soon have the opportunity to vote for legislation that will help lift struggling homeowners, neighborhoods and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan housing bill--forged through compromise and cooperation on the part of Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby and others, is not perfect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not a magic bullet that will solve the problem. Either coauthor would be the first to say that. But it is an important step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts now predict 3 million foreclosures in the next 2 years. Another 45 million homeowners will experience reduced value in their homes as a result of these foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevadans are facing the fallout of this crisis more than any other state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February alone, one out of every 165 homes was in foreclosure. That is the highest rate in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevada's economy is suffering, just as it is throughout America, and this bill will help begin to turn things around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If passed into law, the housing bill now before us would improve the prospects and options for families and communities all across our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our country's last great banking crisis in the 1930s, the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, was created to stabilize the economy and help Americans secure the benefits of homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past three quarters of a century, millions of American families have become homeowners with the help of the FHA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the rules that govern the FHA have limited the effectiveness of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our housing bill addresses this problem by modernizing the FHA. One of the principal benefits will be to permanently raise loan limits to $550,000 and to introduce more flexibility into the lending process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has announced his support for FHA modernization. Democrats and Republicans in Congress agree that it is the right thing to do for American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will achieve that crucial and bipartisan goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the many little-noticed consequences of the war in Iraq is that thousands of service men and women stationed overseas are struggling to meet their mortgage obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is more than enough. They should not ever be forced to sacrifice their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our housing bill will help avoid that terrible prospect. We extend for service members the protection period against foreclosure and make it easier for them to afford their mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just some of the important provisions that this bill includes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as I have said before, we must recognize that the upcoming vote is just the beginning of a process that begins here in the Senate and will continue in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that when the process is complete, we will have a strengthened bipartisan bill that will do even more to help families, communities and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the administration announced a new program at the FHA that would insure new loans that refinance existing mortgages for homeowners who are "underwater," meaning that they owe more than their house is now worth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are reports that 9 million homeowners are now under water. The  administration's proposal is predicted to help just 100,000 of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is encouraging that President Bush is beginning to address the core of the crisis, but his proposal does not go far enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank have been discussing a similar proposal for weeks that could help as many as 2 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of our work to help our country weather this crisis cannot be overstated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the Washington Post reported that experts at the Federal Reserve have said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The nationwide drop in home prices could put the economy in uncharted territory, as there are no clear precedents for how consumers will respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for Congress to take action. Our vote today marks not the end but the beginning of that process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Alabama and myself be recognized for 20 minutes, 10 minutes apiece, to make some closing comments.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection? Hearing no objection it is so ordered, and the Senator is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I make those remarks, and I have checked with the Parliamentarians, I would be remiss if I didn't recognize a former colleague, Senator John Glenn, who is here on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Glenn, welcome to the Senate. Nice to have you back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may, this morning, I think we have adopted a very good piece of legislation, one that is going to take a significant step in dealing with the present housing crisis in our country. As I have repeated on numerous occasions over the last number of  weeks on the Senate floor, almost 8,000 people every single day are facing foreclosure. That is a staggering number of people, and in a given week's time that would fill most any college or  professional sports stadium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eight thousand people every day run the risk of losing their most important asset outside of their beloved family members. The greatest accumulation of wealth for most people is their home. It may mean for them, in their future, providing for a secure retirement, dealing with college education, providing for the unforeseen crisis that can occur where that equity in a home can make all the difference in the world, not to mention what a stabilizing influence it has for a family, a neighborhood,  or a community. Home ownership. All of that is at risk for too many of our fellow citizenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over these last many days, the Senator from Alabama and I and others have tried not to solve every problem in that area but to take a major step forward in addressing the issue of foreclosure, the housing crisis, and the economic problems we face. I think we have done that with this bill. This legislation includes the original ideas we were able to work out a week or so ago dealing with FHA modernization, dealing with disclosure, dealing with mortgage revenue bonds, and dealing with the idea  of providing some tax relief for people who are willing to move in and occupy foreclosed properties, which provides assistance to communities that would otherwise lose as a result of having dilapidated and boarded-up properties in their midst. And there were a number of other provisions, including counseling services and the like, included in that core piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But over the past week, a little less than a week, we have added a number of other provisions to this bill at the behest of our colleagues, working with both the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee as well as members of the Banking Committee and those who are interested in this legislation. The underlying bill and the important provisions in it contained many good increases in support for various things we need to accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the managers' package, which was adopted last evening, accommodates 16 different amendments, Mr. President. These amendments help veterans meet their housing needs. We actually increased some counseling funds that Senator Murray and Senator Mikulski and Senator Schumer were interested in. We improved coordination at counseling agencies. We were able to accommodate a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly want to express my gratitude to Senator Salazar for his amendment, Senator Boxer, Senator Carper, and Senator McCaskill, who offered some very good ideas. I mentioned Senator Murray and Senator Mikulski, Senator Leahy, Senator Johnson, Senator Crapo, along with Senators HARKIN and SANDERS and PRYOR, and Senator Ensign, Senator Brownback, Senator Gregg,  Senator DeMint, and Senator Cornyn, who all offered ideas which we were able to accommodate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of both sides had a lot of very good ideas which strengthen this bill. So we are very grateful for their participation and involvement in allowing us to come to where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should have actually begun my remarks by thanking the majority leader. Senator Reid made this possible. When I talked with Senator Reid about a week and a half, 2 weeks ago, after having a conversation with Senator Shelby and other members of the Banking Committee, we believed we could come forward with a core group of ideas and offer our colleagues the opportunity to begin to move on this housing crisis. Senator Reid approached the Republican leader, Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say very quickly that this bill is called the Foreclosure Prevention Act. Quite candidly, what we have done doesn't quite live up to the title. We have more work  to do. We don't do enough, in my view, in preventing more foreclosures in the country. We do some things but not enough. But I would say to my colleagues who are concerned, we are not done yet. There is more work that needs to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, this morning, Senator Shelby and I and the committee were having a hearing on how to deal with additional foreclosures in the country. We have more work to do--another hearing next week. We have to deal with the Government-sponsored enterprise legislation, we have flood insurance to deal with, and a number of other issues that require our attention, and our intention is to work on those issues. So more work needs to be done, but at this juncture we believe we have presented  a good package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Congressman Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is holding hearings this very morning, as he has over the last day or so, on these issues. My hope is we can get quickly to a conference with the other body on this package and come back with a compromise that is as strong as the one we are sending out for consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Senator Shelby, my friend and colleague from Alabama. We have worked closely together over the years on the Banking Committee. I served under his chairmanship of the committee where he had good strong leadership and offered some very strong ideas that were adopted by the Congress of the United States. The tide has turned. I am now chairman. But I have a good partner in Senator Shelby and his staff in helping us work through these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, Senator McConnell, and their staffs for their work as well on this legislation, but we don't often thank or mention the names of the people who do all of the late work, who stay up all night drafting and arguing, disagreeing and debating on what to include in these packages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank, particularly in the leadership area, Gary Myrick, Randy Devalk, Lula Davis, who has been terrific with the floor staff--absolutely wonderful in the last several days--Tim Mitchell, Mark Wetjen on Leader Reid's staff, and Rohit Kumar and Dave Schiappa on the minority leader's staff. Dave, we thank you for your support and help in all of this. On Senator Shelby's staff, Bill Duhnke, Mark Oesterle, Shannon Hines, Mark Calabria, and Jim Johnson all were helpful.  And I want to acknowledge all the positive efforts of my staff: Shawn Maher, the staff director of the Banking Committee; Jonathan Miller, Jenn Fogel-Bublick, Amy Friend, Julie Chon, Lynsey Graham Rea, and Drew Colbert. These are all people--and there are others as well on these committees--who do a lot of good, hard work, and we thank them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. President, before the close of business, another 8,000 people may file for foreclosure in this country, so we have work yet to be done in this area, but this bill is a major, positive step in the right direction. There are provisions that, frankly, I am not as enthusiastic about, but they were consensus provisions added to this legislation. There are many provisions that I think take us exactly in the right direction in minimizing the impact of what is occurring in our country and  allowing us to get back on our feet, again restoring confidence and optimism in the housing market, and for that I am very grateful to all who have participated in allowing us to arrive at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Alabama.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300089" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for all of his cooperation and his leadership on the Banking Committee and on the Senate floor, and I want to associate myself with his remarks, thanking the staff of the Senate and also the staff of the Banking Committee, including my staff and his. It is good to work together where we can in the Senate. And when we do, we get a lot of work done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when crises such as the one we are now facing come about, the American people expect us in the Senate to act in an expeditious and an appropriate manner. I think this is what we have been doing the last couple of weeks. Senator Dodd and I, at the direction of our respective leaders,  Senator Reid, the majority leader, and Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, have invested a considerable amount of time in  drafting a bipartisan and balanced piece of legislation that is focused on addressing the growing number of foreclosures nationwide, which Senator Dodd just mentioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to maintain that balance and to preserve our bipartisan agreement, we were not able to agree to a number of amendments, some of which I believe have a great deal of merit, and I want to touch on some. It is my hope that Senator Dodd and I can continue to work closely on a number of those, such as the need for meaningful GSE reform, as well as a mortgage broker and banker licensing bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Hagel introduced an amendment on GSE reform that I believe may represent the foundation for a very promising approach to addressing a very complex but critical set of issues. I stand ready to work with Senator Dodd at any time to reach an agreement on meaningful GSE reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators FEINSTEIN and MARTINEZ introduced an amendment on mortgage broker and banker licensing that I hope also lays the foundation for further action by the Banking Committee, headed by Senator Dodd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other provisions that are not in this bill and that I could not support. These included the bankruptcy provision, or so-called cram-down, as well as an unprecedented expansion of the FHA guarantee to hundreds of thousands of homeowners who find themselves underwater on their mortgages and stretched beyond their means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when we began consideration of this bill, I said the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we are in agreement on the measures contained in this bill, there is a line that we should not cross. That line is represented by a taxpayer-funded bailout of investors or homeowners that freely and willingly entered into mortgages that they knew or should have known they could not afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that in mind, I intend to examine closely any proposals to further expose the American taxpayer to the risks freely incurred by individuals or investors. I understand that Chairman Dodd intends to hold additional hearings on just such a proposal. I intend to work closely with him to ensure that all facets of this approach are examined thoroughly before we expose those who made prudent financial choices to the risks created by those who didn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, I believe our primary responsibility is to the American taxpayer. In our zeal to help those who find themselves in financial difficulty, we must make sure that we do not do more harm than good. This bill does include a number of provisions that deserved my colleagues' support, and that they supported. The bill makes the necessary changes in the FHA program so that it can meet the needs of today's mortgage marketplace. The FHA language provides protections for the American  taxpayer, who ultimately bears the financial risk of the program. The FHA title provides immediate help to the marketplace by reforming the Federal Housing Administration, allowing it to provide greater liquidity and thereby enhancing the options available to America's homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides additional funding for foreclosure prevention counseling--Senator Dodd has spoken on this--which will help homeowners stay current on their mortgages and be able to remain in their homes. That is our goal. This is an area in which I hope to work closely with Senator Dodd over the coming year. I believe we must conduct thorough oversight to ensure that this money is being spent properly and effectively. Should additional funds be necessary, I believe they  can be provided during the normal appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to prevent a repeat of the current housing crisis, the bill also increases the disclosures made to consumers obtaining mortgages, which I think is very important. I believe giving consumers more information so they understand what they are doing and the ability to understand the choices they are making will help them avoid making the pitfalls and bad decisions many uninformed consumers made in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To protect our soldiers, sailors, and airmen, the bill extends additional consumer protections and provides those returning from combat a chance to get back on their feet before they face any type of foreclosure proceeding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in an effort to provide communities with the ability to clean up the damage caused by the foreclosures that have already occurred, we have included funding to allow States and communities to buy up and repair foreclosed residences through the Community Development Block Grant Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Attached to this funding is a requirement that any profits from the sale of properties must be used to buy and repair additional properties. I believe that reuse of this funding in this manner will maximize the impact of these dollars and minimize the possibility that funds will be wasted or profits inappropriately pocketed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also contains a number of tax-related provisions prepared in a bipartisan fashion by the chairman and ranking member on the Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill also includes a managers' package that contains a broad range of provisions offered by 13 separate Senators. Chairman Dodd and I worked closely to come to agreement on including this group of provisions that, I believe, strengthens the core bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first group of provisions touch upon a number of veterans and military service personnel housing programs. These measures provide greater resources, flexibility, and options for veterans and military personnel to help meet the particular challenges they face in regards to their housing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The managers' package puts to greater use assets in the Home Loan Bank system to help bring additional resources to the effort to deal with current conditions in the housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package includes additional consumer protections for senior citizens who participate in the FHA-insured reverse mortgage program. The package requires enhanced scrutiny of loan originators participating in the FHA program, which should better protect the solvency of the taxpayer backed mortgage insurance fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package also ensures that funds are not used to provide inappropriate benefits to private entities by prohibiting the use of funds in cases where eminent domain is used to benefit private parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the managers' amendment protects taxpayers by requiring that any profits made from the sale of rehabilitated homes that are not reinvested in the program are recaptured and returned to the Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe this is a focused and targeted piece of legislation that will address in an appropriate manner a number of the difficulties we are now facing in the housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are a large and growing number of homes entering foreclosure, we must remember that the vast majority of homeowners are living within their means and making their mortgage payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some would argue that we have a responsibility to aid those who find themselves under water on their mortgages or unable to afford their increasing payments, I would argue that we also have equal responsibility to those who have made prudent financial decisions. We must not forget them as we seek to help others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the eve of an election year can be a very difficult time to reach consensus on just about anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we are able to come together, it is incumbent upon us to seize that opportunity and move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think this is a good bill overall, and I was pleased to see the vote of the Senate just a few minutes ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
