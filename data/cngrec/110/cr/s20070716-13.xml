  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to address a subject that I hope we will be able to address soon and that is an amendment that Senator Graham of South Carolina has filed and, hopefully, we will debate soon. It relates to conditions that have been placed in the underlying bill, relating to the treatment of detainees captured in Afghanistan and Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about the damage that would  be brought on the global war against terrorists and future wars that we may have to fight if we go forward with the language that is in the bill, specifically in section 1023 of the bill. That essentially would return us to a law enforcement approach to terrorists that, frankly, failed us before 9/11 and, once Osama bin Laden and others declared war on us, would obviously not work  in the post-9/11 context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Graham's amendment strikes these harmful provisions in the bill and would replace them with commonsense measures to provide a more fair process in dealing with detainees at Guantanamo. I remind my colleagues for a moment about the nature of these terrorists whom we are talking about, and then I will go through specific provisions of the bill that need to be removed--specifically three: a requirement that al-Qaida terrorists held in Iraq and Afghanistan be given lawyers; the authorization  to demands discovery and compel testimony from servicemembers; and the requirement that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees be provided access to classified evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To review the nature of the detainees that we are holding, not just at Guantanamo Bay but also in Iraq and Afghanistan, these are not nice people. At least 30 of the detainees released from Guantanamo Bay have since returned to waging war against the United States and our allies; 12 of these released detainees have been killed in battle by U.S. forces and others have been recaptured; two released detainees became regional commanders for Taliban forces; one released detainee attacked U.S. and  allied soldiers in Afghanistan, killing three Afghan soldiers; one released detainee killed an Afghan judge; one released detainee led a terrorist attack on a hotel in Pakistan and a kidnapping raid that resulted in the death of a Chinese civilian, and this former detainee recently told Pakistani journalists he planned to "fight America and its allies until the very end."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions of section 1023 would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to detain these committed terrorists who have been captured while waging war against us. No nation has, in the history of armed conflict, imposed the kinds of limits that the bill would impose on its ability to detain enemy war prisoners. War prisoners released in the middle of an ongoing conflict, such as members of al-Qaida, will return to waging war. We have already seen this happen 30 times  with detainees released from Guantanamo Bay. If section 1023 of the bill is enacted into law, we could expect that number to increase sharply. If section 1023 is enacted, we should expect that more civilians and Afghans and Iraqi soldiers will be killed, and it may be inevitable that our own soldiers will be injured or killed by such released terrorists. This is a price our Nation should not be forced to bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk first about the requirement in the bill that al-Qaida terrorists held in Iraq and Afghanistan must be provided with lawyers. This cannot be executed. It would require the release of detainees. Here is why: The Defense bill requires that counsel be provided and trials be conducted for all unlawful enemy combatants held by the United States, including, for example, al-Qaida members captured and detained in Iraq and Afghanistan if they are held for 2 years. We hold approximately 800  prisoners in Afghanistan and tens of thousands in Iraq. None of them are lawful combatants and all would arguably be entitled to a trial and a lawyer under the bill. Such a provision would at least require a military judge, a prosecutor, and a defense attorney, as well as other legal professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That scheme is not realistic. The entire Army JAG Corps only consists of approximately 1,500 officers, and each is busy with their current duties. Moreover, under the bill, each detainee would be permitted to retain a private or volunteer counsel. Our agreements with the Iraqi Government bar the United States from transferring Iraqi detainees out of Iraq. As a result, the bill would require the United States to train and transport and house and protect potentially thousands, or even tens of thousands,  of private lawyers in the middle of a war zone during ongoing hostilities. That is impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That proposal is half baked at best. It would likely force the United States to release thousands of enemy combatants in Iraq, giving them the ability to resume waging war against the United States. Obviously, this would tie up our military. By requiring a trial for each detainee, this provision would also require U.S. soldiers to offer  statements to criminal investigators, needing later to prove their case after they captured someone. They would need to carry some kind of evidence kits or combat cameras or some other method of preserving the evidence and to establish its chain of custody. They would need to spend hours after each trial writing afteraction reports, which would need to be reviewed by commanders. Valuable time would be taken away from combat operations and soldiers' rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be a bad precedent for the future. Aside from the war in Iraq, this provision would make fighting a major war in the future simply impossible. Consider this: During World War II, the United States detained over 2 million enemy war prisoners. It would have been impossible for the United States to have conducted a trial and provided counsel to 2 million captured enemy combatants. So the bottom line is that the bill, as written, would likely be impossible to implement in Iraq and, in the  context of past wars, it is patently absurd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second point is authorizing al-Qaida detainees to demand discovery and compel testimony from American soldiers. The underlying bill would actually authorize unlawful enemy combatants, including al-Qaida detained in Iraq and Afghanistan, to demand discovery and could compel testimony from witnesses as we do in our criminal courts in the United States. The witnesses would be the U.S. soldiers who captured the prisoner. Under this bill, an American soldier could literally be recalled from his  unit at the whim of an al-Qaida terrorist in order to be cross-examined by a judge or that terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Newspaper columnist Stewart Taylor describes the questions that such a right would raise:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Should a Marine sergeant be pulled out of combat in Afghanistan to testify at a detention hearing about when, where, how, and why he had captured the detainee? What if the northern alliance or some other ally made the capture? Should the military be ordered to deliver high-level al-Qaida prisoners to be cross-examined by other detainees and their lawyers?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The questions abound. As the Supreme Court observed in Johnson v. Eisenstrager, which is the law on this subject:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his own civil court and divert his efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what the U.S. Supreme Court said in World War II when a similar issue was raised. It would be difficult to conceive of a process that would be more insulting to our soldiers. In addition, many al-Qaida members who were captured in Afghanistan were captured by special operators whose identities are kept secret for obvious reasons. This would force them to reveal themselves to al-Qaida members, therefore exposing themselves or to simply forgo the prosecution of the individual, which is  more likely what would happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, Americans should not be subject to subpoena by al-Qaida. That brings me to the last point--the requirement that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees be provided with access to classified evidence. The bill requires that detainees be provided with "a sufficiently specific substitute of classified evidence" and that detainees' private lawyers be given access to all relevant classified evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreign and domestic intelligence agencies are already very hesitant to divulge classified evidence to the CSRT hearings we currently conduct. These are part of the internal and nonadversarial military process today. Intelligence agencies will inevitably refuse to provide sensitive evidence to detainees and their lawyers. They will not risk compromising such information for the sake of detaining an individual terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the United States already has tenuous relations with some of the foreign governments, particularly in the Middle East, that have  been our best sources of intelligence about al-Qaida. If we give detainees a legal right to access such information, these foreign governments may simply shut off all further supply of information to the United States. These governments will not want to compromise their evidence or expose the fact that they cooperated  with the United States. By exposing our cooperation with these governments, the bill perversely applies a sort of "stop snitching" policy toward our Middle Eastern allies, which is likely to be as effective as when applied to criminal street gangs in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A final point on this: We already know from hard experience that providing classified and other sensitive information to al-Qaida members is a bad idea. During the 1995 Federal prosecution in New York of the "Blind Sheikh," Omar Rahman, prosecutors turned over the names of 200 unindicted coconspirators to the defense. The prosecutors were required to do so under the civilian criminal justice system of discovery rules, which require that large amounts of evidence be turned over to the defense.  The judge warned the defense that the information could only be used to prepare for trial and not for other purposes. Nevertheless, within 10 days of being turned over to the defense, the information found its way to Sudan and into the hands of Osama bin Laden. U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, who presided over the case, explained, "That list was in downtown Khartoum within 10 days, and bin Laden was aware within 10 days that the Government was on his trail."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what happens when you provide classified information in this context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In another case tried in the civilian criminal justice system, testimony about the use of cell phones tipped off terrorists as to how the Government was monitoring their networks. According to the judge, "There was a piece of innocuous testimony about the delivery of a battery for a cell phone." This testimony alerted terrorists to Government surveillance and, as a result, their communication network shut down within days and intelligence was lost to the Government forever--intelligence that  might have prevented who knows what.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill--this particular section of the bill repeats the mistakes of the past. Treating the war with al-Qaida similar to a criminal justice investigation would force the United States to choose between compromising information that could be used to prevent future terrorist attacks and letting captured terrorists go free. This is not a choice that our Nation should be required to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will talk more about some provisions that Senator Graham would like to substitute for these provisions that provide a more fair process for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay--a process that would enable them to have greater benefit of the use of counsel and of evidence in their CSRT hearings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will wait until he actually offers that amendment to get into detail. But the point is, we have bent over backward to provide the detainees at Guantanamo the ability to contest their detention and to have that detention reviewed and eventually have it reviewed in U.S. courts. That is a very fair system, more fair than has ever been provided by any other nation under similar circumstances and more than the Constitution requires. So we are treating the people we captured and are holding at Guantanamo  in a very fair way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we cannot do is take those same kinds of protections and apply them to anybody we capture in a foreign theater who is held in a foreign theater and therefore is not, under current circumstances--and never has been in the history of warfare--subject to the criminal justice system of our country. To take that system and try to transport it to the fields of Afghanistan or Iraq would obviously be not only a breaking of historical precedent but a very bad idea for all of the reasons I just indicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to give very careful consideration to the dangerous return to the pre-9/11 notion of terrorism as a law enforcement problem that is inherent in section 1023 of the bill. The terrorists have made no secret that they are actually at war with us, and we ignore this point at our peril.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude by reminding my colleagues that the Statement of Administration Policy on this bill indicates that the President would be advised to veto it if these provisions remained. Therefore, I urge my colleagues, when the opportunity is presented, to join me in striking the provisions of the bill, not only as representing good policy but to help us ensure that at the end of the day, there will be a bill signed by the President called the Defense authorization bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe I have a half hour to speak in morning business. Prior to doing so, I wish to give a brief rejoinder to my colleague from Arizona on some of the comments he just made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that the underlying Defense Authorization Act has several provisions that are necessary to address shortcomings in the legal process for individuals detained on the battlefield. One of these provisions limits the use of coerced testimony obtained through cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. Such testimony is immoral, and this provision is necessary if we are to obtain and use accurate information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another provision provides for reasonable counsel and the ability to present relevant information to detainees who have been held for 2 or more years. This is necessary in a war of undetermined duration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill does not provide classified information to a detainee. It provides for a summary that is intended to be unclassified to the counsel for detainees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that might help is if, on line 16, page 305, subsection II, the word "unclassified" was added before the word "summary" on that line. I believe that is the intent.</paragraph>
