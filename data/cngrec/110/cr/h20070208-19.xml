    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, recently Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said it is time for Congress to return to fiscal responsibility. It is often said that the best way to lead is by example. But I don't know if spending $300,000 of the taxpayer money to fly the Speaker in a personal luxury jet to travel back and forth to San Francisco sets much of an example, particularly when any American can find a $300 ticket for the same route on expedia.com.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to CNN, Speaker Pelosi has requested that the military give her a jet that would include 42 business class seats, a fully enclosed stateroom, an entertainment center, a private bed, state-of-the-art communications system and a crew of 16.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know there are legitimate security concerns, but somehow the previous Speaker managed to use a smaller jet that seated 12 and had none of these amenities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why did the Speaker request this jet? According to the Washington Times, the Democrat, quote, "is seeking regular military flights not only for herself and her staff, but also for relatives and other Members of Congress."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this is the Democrats' idea of fiscal responsibility, working families had better hold on to their wallets.</paragraph>
