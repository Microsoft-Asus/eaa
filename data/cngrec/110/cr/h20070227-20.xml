    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate another college for their accomplishments. Mount Union College, located in Alliance, Ohio, is not only known as one of the top liberal arts colleges in the Midwest but also more recently for winning the NCAA Division III Football National Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 16 of last year, the Mount Union College Purple Raiders captured their ninth NCAA Division III Football National Championship by defeating the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that such accomplishments are achieved through a group effort. I applaud the Purple Raiders coaching staff; the administration; student athletes; and, of course, the fans for a championship season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my congratulations to the Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks for a well-played game and a successful season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Purple Raiders, whose purple parrot mascot is well known in northeastern Ohio, have achieved some notable athletic accomplishments, including nine national championships in the past 14 years, along with two of the longest winning streaks in college football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again I commend and congratulate Mount Union College  for their dedication and success, not only for their athletic prowess but also for their academic achievement and academic reputation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support for this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 103. This resolution congratulates the Mount Union College Purple Raiders for winning the 2006 NCAA Division III Football National Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Purple Raiders captured the title by defeating the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks 35-16 in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl on December 16 in front of 6,051 faithful fans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1990, and under the tutelage of Head Coach Larry Kehres, the Raiders have made 16 playoff appearances while posting college football's most wins and best winning percentage. Coach Kehres completed his 21st year at the helm of the Purple Raiders football fortunes in 2006 and has built one of the most successful programs in all of college football. His teams have won 17 Ohio Athletic Conference Championships while posting 15 undefeated regular seasons and have won nine Division III National  Championships in the last 14 years. Along the way, Coach Kehres has compiled a phenomenal 246-20-3 record and the best career winning percentage for a head coach, at any division level, in the history of college football. For his efforts, Kehres has been named the AFCA Division III National Coach of the Year eight times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to Head Coach Larry Kehres, all of the hardworking players, the fans, and to Mount Union College. I am happy to join my good friend and colleague Representative Regula in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield at this time such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400334" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="103">H. Res. 103</bill>, congratulating the Mount Union College Purple Raiders on their 2006 Division III Football National Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Ohio is quite a football State; and while most people think of teams like Ohio State when they think of Ohio football, the team with the most amazing winning record is actually Mount Union College and its Purple Raiders. In December they beat the Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Purple Raiders from Mount Union College in Alliance have been a perpetually dominant team under the reign of Head Coach Larry Kehres and staff, winning an astounding nine NCAA Division III Football Championships. The players who have come and gone through the Mount Union football program should also be honored for their superior work ethic on the football field and in the classroom. As an alumnus of Mount Union College, I take special pride that the students that remain in the football program  all 4 years have an incredible 98 percent graduation rate. That is astounding, I think, everything considered in what we hear and so on. Such phenomenal scholastic and athletic achievement should not go unnoticed. These graduation rates are impressive for any higher education institution and are especially remarkable for college athletes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most recent NCAA victory comes as no surprise to those who have followed the Purple Raiders over the past two decades. They have had the two longest winning streaks in all of college football, with 54 consecutive victories from 1996 to 1999 and 55 victories from 2000 to 2003. The Purple Raiders also currently hold the second longest winning streak in all of college football, with 23 consecutive victories. With winning streaks like these, it is no shock that Larry Kehres has the best career  winning percentage in any division level of college football ever, with a remarkable record of 246 wins, 20 losses, and 3 ties. That is a remarkable record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with such incredible regular season records, the Purple Raiders have also won nine NCAA Division III championships, 17 Ohio Athletic Conference titles to go along with 15 perfect seasons. These statistics have all been achieved under the excellent coaching of Larry Kehres. His record has earned him the American Football Coaches Association Division III Coach of the Year a record eight times. Coach Kehres can certainly take great pride in the dexterity and proficiency he has instilled in  the young athletes that have walked the halls of Mount Union College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's players have yet again risen to the occasion and proved to be the best of Division III. The Purple Raiders finished first nationally in Division III football in total offense and second in total defense, which can only give a slight indication as to the work ethic of this team. The national title they achieved in 2006 was well earned by these athletes, coaches, and staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to congratulate Mount Union College President Richard Giese; Coach Larry Kehres; his coaches; the faculty and staff; as well as the terrific and enthusiastic fans, and we have them, but especially all of the players for yet another undefeated year and national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 2006 was a great season, and I am sure it will not be the last for these Purple Raiders. As the great coach Vince Lombardi once said, "Being a champion means you are willing to go longer, work harder, and give more than anyone else." The current Purple Raiders team and those of prior seasons, along with Coach Kehres, have proven the wisdom of this statement time and time again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be here to sing the praises of the Purple Raiders. When I heard Mr. Regula talk about all of their accomplishments and then the 98 percent graduation rate, that really is impressive. I would like to meet Coach Kehres one day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mr. Regula for having such an outstanding institution in his district to represent. When you consider all of the football games that they have won, as well as the graduation rate and the kind of academics that they display, he has to indeed be proud. I am proud for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
