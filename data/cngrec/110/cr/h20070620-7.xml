    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in a recent international survey, we find that nations around the world think China could be better trusted to lead this world than the United States. It's a devastating conclusion. It would not have been the case even 6 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not that people around the world don't acknowledge our military power, but it is our arrogance and the fact that we don't live up to our principles and ideals that this survey reflects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are going to win this so-called global war on terrorism, it is not going to be through a military victory. It is going to be because we stand by the values and ideals and principles that define us as a nation and as a people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that every day undermines those defining principles is keeping the Guantanamo detention facility open, keeping hundreds of people detained without charging them, without enabling them to know what they are charged with and thus being able to defend themselves. It's the antithesis of what this country stands for. That detention facility needs to be shut down. And we need to regain our rightful position as the leader of the free world.</paragraph>
