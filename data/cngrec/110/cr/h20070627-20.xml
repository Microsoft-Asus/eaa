  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend and colleague, MARTY MEEHAN, the chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. I would like to thank him on behalf of the committee for his distinguished service to our country and to the men and women who wear the uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MARTY came to the House of Representatives in 1993 to represent the Fifth District of Massachusetts. He's worked tirelessly to encourage economic development in the area, to redevelop and maintain the military presence at Fort Devens, and to preserve over 10,000 acres of open space in Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, MARTY was the lead Democrat sponsor of the Shays-Meehan-McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MARTY has served on the Armed Services Committee since coming to the House of Representatives in the early 1990s. Marty was the ranking member of the Terrorism and Unconventional Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and has been an active member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, where Marty has had a strong interest in helping Reservists and Guardsmen in their transition from military to civilian life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, MARTY has led a bipartisan investigation into the development of the Iraqi Security Forces. The product of this investigation, a report on subcommittee's findings and recommendations, was unanimously agreed upon and signed by every member of that subcommittee. The report seeks to present information for the public debate and recommends increased transparency into the training of the Iraqi Security Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish MARTY MEEHAN the best of luck as he leaves this institution to serve as the next chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.</paragraph>
