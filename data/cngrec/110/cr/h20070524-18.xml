  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, the House of Representatives will vote on a war spending bill that does not call for accountability. Unlike the previous Iraq supplemental, the bill we are voting on today does not provide the American people with a path to end this war. For me, the issue of accountability is imperative. Without a real accountability plan in Iraq, there is no telling how long this war will continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were elected to bring a new direction in Iraq, and I will continue that fight, along with many of my colleagues. As I have made clear time and time again with my votes, I fully support our troops and their families. But I also believe that it is Congress' duty to support a change in the Iraq policy that will meet our national security objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the people of South Florida chose me to be their voice in Congress, they put their trust and faith in me to represent their values and priorities. Along with the people of South Florida, I will continue to stand up and work toward a new policy in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I will vote against the Iraq supplemental bill today.</paragraph>
