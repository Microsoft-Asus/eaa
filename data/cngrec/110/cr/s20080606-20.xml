  <narrative>HIGH GAS PRICES -- (Senate - June 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5361">S5361</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are getting ready to consider the gasoline bill next week and all its ramifications for the American public who are suffering under $4 and $4-plus gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few days ago, this Senator showed a photograph of a town in north Florida, Madison, FL, in Madison County, downtown, the local Shell Oil station. Regular in the State of Florida, reflected in that photograph of a few days ago, was at $4.10 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes without saying that our people are hurting. And I can tell you, having had 18 townhall meetings last week all over my State, that hurting has turned into frustration, and that frustration is turning into anger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is a new poll out this week that reflects the increasing number of Americans who believe it is the supply and demand of oil that is driving these prices to record highs--just the supply and demand. We know we have a very tight world oil market, and we know places such as India and China in fact are consuming more oil, and their demand is higher. We understand that makes the world's oil markets all the more tight. And believe it or not, because of that, and because of this constant  amount of information coming out from the oil sector about supply and demand creating the tight oil market, the American people are believing that is the cause of these record oil prices, believing that translates into these very high gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting because it is just at a time that the Senate has voted to close the so-called Enron loophole, which is perhaps the real culprit to blame in the shocking runup of the oil prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what is the Enron loophole? Back in the year 2000, legislation was passed that exempted oil and metals from being regulated on the commodity futures exchange. That meant that as contracts for future purchase of oil and metals are being traded, there is no government oversight, no government regulation of how much those can go up. So as long as the participants bidding for those futures contracts continue to bid the price of those oil contracts higher and higher, in fact the price of that  oil on the world market continues to go higher and higher, much over and above what normal supply and demand would cause the price to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This closing of that Enron loophole has just occurred. It is still in the works because even though it was added to the farm bill, the farm bill was vetoed by the President. The veto was then overridden and, therefore, it came into law immediately upon the override. Nevertheless, we found that we omitted a section of the farm bill, so we are going back and redoing that all over again. We just passed the farm bill again in its entirety in the Senate yesterday, last night. It does have the  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="5362">S5362</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what happened in the past? It was enacted back in 2000--in December of 2000. I believe that loophole, when enacted, was exploited by energy traders. This is based on the mounting evidence that we see over and over. It is at least a partial cause of the huge runup in the gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I think we need to do more on this Enron loophole. There have been some commentaries by some experts that say we should be closing it further. And if we need to do that, this Senator is certainly ready to do it. But right now what needs further examination is how we got to this point in the first place. How did this provision in law, leaving this huge hole big enough to drive a Mack truck through get to this point where it essentially exempted the trading of oil futures from Federal commodities  regulation? How did that become the law of the land? What was the role of lobbyists and oil companies and investment banks and commodity speculators? We need answers to those questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen through testimony to the Congress and from other reports that unchecked commodities trading plays a very significant role in rising gasoline prices. We know high gas prices are not merely a function of supply and demand in the marketplace. In fact, we ought to know this from several years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A subcommittee, led by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, found that supplies were mostly adequate, but it found something else was missing. What was the role that caused these prices to be jacked up? Just a few days ago, financier George Soros told our Senate Commerce Committee--in fact, just this past Tuesday--that a dramatic increase in commodities trading in recent years has contributed to the oil bubble and its "harmful economic consequences."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, loosely regulated speculators appear to have bid up oil prices to these unrealistic highs. There are also links between oil companies and investment banks in the oil futures trading. And this is what these reports are showing. The Senate investigations subcommittee, in a bipartisan way, under the leadership of Senator Levin, released a report finding that there was lax Federal oversight of oil and gas traders due to the loophole slipped into the law in 2000, and it was slipped  in at the behest, according to the Levin report, of the now infamous Enron Corporation, along with oil companies and investment banks. That is according to the Levin report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other links between soaring oil prices and vast sums of money now flowing through these commodity markets were uncovered by a Homeland Security panel and our colleague, Independent-Democrat Senator Joe Lieberman. In fact, a top oil executive for a major oil company recently testified before a House panel that crude oil, under normal supply and demand, ought to be around $55 a barrel, based on the rule of supply and demand. Yet last week it went up to $135, and it is somewhere in the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think those investigations into the cause of the runup of the price of oil ought to continue. An estimated one-third of the amount of the runup of the price of oil can be blamed on speculators having poured tens of billions of dollars into the unregulated energy commodities markets in the wake of that so-called Enron loophole that deregulated those commodities markets. In essence, the loophole exempted electronic trading of energy and metal by large traders--exempted them from  Federal commodities regulation. Since then the price of oil and natural gas has skyrocketed, and that is all despite reports that the supplies are mostly adequate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week we are going to try to take up legislation aimed at getting at this situation of high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Senator intends to address this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If, in fact, as that oil company executive said, supply and demand ought to cause oil to be trading at $55, why is it trading in excess of $130? What role do the unregulated commodities markets play, and how did that get into law? How much of that capital out there is flowing into that because those markets are unregulated, thereby driving up that price to what we have today?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see one Federal agency that otherwise regulates futures trading has said it will investigate allegations of short-term manipulation of crude oil prices. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also said it would work with British regulators to monitor large trades of crude oil by a London futures exchange known as ICE, Intercontinental Exchange. Some of the founding members of that intercontinental exchange, it has been reported, were instrumental in getting the Enron loophole through Congress  back in the year 2000. It was ill-conceived public policy at best, and it should be reversed. Next week we are going to have a chance to do something about it because we have legislation on the price of gasoline coming to the Senate floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By having greater oversight and regulation on oil trading, we obviously have to go beyond that and look to our commitment to a comprehensive national energy policy. Fifty percent of the oil we use goes into transportation, and most of that is for our personal vehicles. So it should not take a rocket scientist to realize we must focus on conservation measures like 40 miles per gallon as a fleet average for our vehicles. We finally broke through and got through the Senate 35 miles per gallon phased  in over the next 12 years. Maybe we ought to accelerate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought to look at providing bigger tax breaks for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Ultimately, we must look to the research and development of electric and hydrogen-powered cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of this is going to fall in the lap of the next President. The next President is going to have to urge us--and I hope we will support the next President--to enact a national energy program to transition us from gasoline to alternative, synthetic, and renewable fuels to power much of this economic engine of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Kennedy led us on such a monumental task, and that was the task to escape the bonds of Earth within a decade, to go to the Moon, and return safely. We did that. We must act with the same urgency now. While we are at it, we are going to have to make ethanol from things that we do not eat. While we are at that, we are going to have to pay attention to how we power, not just our cars and trucks, but our homes and our industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to develop solar and wind and thermal energy and safe nuclear power. The world is begging for change. One of the most enormous changes that needs to be brought about is how we utilize and how we create energy and how we are going to utilize and create energy for the future. We have a chance to do that next week when we take up this legislation about the high price of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
