  <narrative>FARM BILL -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3701]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. NEUGEBAUER asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the final conference report that was just brought to this House of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a conferee, I participated in many hours of bipartisan and bicameral negotiations at which point we reached a bill that will be good for American agriculture, and it will be good for the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is important that we have a strong agricultural industry in this country today. We've already seen the implications of having other countries furnish our energy needs on a daily basis, and the last thing in the world that we need to happen is to rely on other countries to feed and clothe the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the reason, Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we get this important piece of legislation passed, sooner rather than later. Many producers all across America, farmers and ranchers, have already planted crops, and they do not have any policy to operate under.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I urge my colleagues, when this bill comes to the floor this week, to vote positively for American agriculture and the American people.</paragraph>
