    <paragraph>Mr. President, following any time Senator McConnell and I will use, there will be 60 minutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="sj" number="9">S.J. Res. 9</bill> relating to Iraq policy. The time is equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their designees. The leaders will have the final 20 minutes immediately prior to the vote, with the majority leader controlling the last 10 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had an ongoing discussion with the Republican leader about how we could or would proceed to the Iraq resolution following whatever happens this morning. In addition to Iraq, I mentioned a proposed agreement regarding the U.S. attorney legislation. I anticipate that agreement will be able to be reached soon, which would eliminate the necessity of a cloture vote on the motion to proceed on the legislation. If no agreement is reached, then once we dispose of the Iraq resolution, a cloture  vote would occur automatically on the motion to proceed to the U.S. attorney legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the day progresses, I will have more to say about the schedule after conferring with the Republican leader.</paragraph>
