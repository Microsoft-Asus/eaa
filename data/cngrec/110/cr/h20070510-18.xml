    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday a petition signed by nearly 3,000 men and women currently serving in Iraq was accepted by the House of Representatives by Leader Boehner. The appeal simply states, "As an American currently serving my nation in uniform, I respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to fully support our mission in Iraq and halt any calls for retreat. The war in Iraq is a necessary and just effort to bring freedom to the Middle East and protect  America from further attacks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This petition was organized by two U.S. servicemen serving in Iraq, Lieutenant Jason Nichols and Staff Sergeant David Thul. In a statement released yesterday, they said, "We are respectfully asking for full support in finishing the mission you assigned us here in Iraq. Patience and resolve will result in a stable democratic country in the Middle East. Early withdrawal will result in a stronger enemy, a weaker America and a demoralized united armed forces. We need your support to finish the job."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these are the thoughts of men and women fighting this war. We owe it to them to listen. They've earned it.</paragraph>
