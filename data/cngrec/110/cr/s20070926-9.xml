    <paragraph>Mr. President, against all odds, the long-suffering people of Burma have risen against one of the world's most repressive regimes. What began a month ago as modest, impromptu protests has now mushroomed into a nationwide peaceful democratic groundswell. Tens of thousands of students have joined Buddhist monks in the streets, marching and chanting in unison against Burma's brutal military rulers. I met with some of those rulers a number of years ago when I went to Burma. I also had  a chance to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi in her home where she has been under house arrest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an extraordinary division that is growing and growing in Burma, where the military junta, unbelievably unpopular, nevertheless clings to power through the force of the military which it controls. The riches of the country are exclusively being diverted to their spoils, while Burma remains now and increasingly becomes poorer and poorer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Burmese people need to know that the courage they are demonstrating today and what they are fighting for is being watched by people all over the world, that we admire what they are attempting to achieve, and that we stand in awe of their commitment, of their courage. Their actions follow in the venerable footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, and all of those heroes who understand that nonviolent resistance is humanity's greatest weapon against tyranny and injustice. We,  with all of the tools available to us, need to make certain the people of Burma understand that their courage is breaking through and that this moment is one we share with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is happening today in the streets of Rangoon is, however, as tenuous as it is unexpected. Just this morning, we learned that warning shots were fired and tensions are escalating. I do not know how many people realize it, but the Government of Burma, the junta, moved to its own sort of private capital and has created this almost surreal exiled government where they feel safe, as if living in a bunker within the isolation of Burma itself. Just this morning, we also learned that the cabal of  generals that is pillaging Burma under the guise of governing it could easily meet these nonviolent protests with a bloodbath, just as they did in 1988. So it is important that none of us allow the scrutiny on Burma to be diminished. This could conceivably become another Tiananmen Square moment, if it does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one should doubt the Burmese junta's potential for brutality and large-scale violence. Since taking power, they have killed tens of thousands of Burmese, and they have razed more villages than have been destroyed in Darfur. Over half a million people have been internally displaced, and an additional 1 million refugees have fled the country. The tyrannical thugs who run the country are engaged in the systematic use of forced labor, human trafficking, forcible recruitment of child soldiers,  torture and rape--an appalling laundry list of human rights violations. Yet, despite such grave danger, the people of Burma have stood strong in the face of this extraordinary evil. They demand Democratic reforms and basic human rights, and they have done so with dignity, and they have done so peacefully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States and the rest of the free world must find more ways to make it clear that we stand with the people of Burma. The President's decision yesterday to target the top general for financial sanctions is a step in the right direction, but it will not solve the problem, and it is not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The massive prodemocracy demonstrations in Burma represent the best opportunity for genuine political change in nearly years. Burma's Saffron Revolution is also an excellent chance for America to finally show greater diplomatic leadership on the world stage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States needs to lead the international community in pressuring the military junta to release all political prisoners, starting with the venerable Nobel Prize laureate and opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and take steps down the path from there to more thorough political change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week's gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly is ready made. It is a forum waiting to be utilized properly. My hope is that the United Nations will take the necessary steps to make even more clear the world's condemnation but, more importantly, to create real pressure, and that includes pressure from places such as China, which has been playing a clearly duplicitous game because of their deep investments, their proximity, and other occasional similarities in the  way in which they have dealt with democracy uprisings. From the halls of the United Nations to the headquarters of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the message to the Burmese military needs to be clear: The world is united behind the people marching</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Showing diplomatic leadership on Burma also requires that we demand better from those countries that have propped up this brutal regime and are thus the best equipped to help pressure it. India and, in particular, China can make a significant difference in this outcome. The President and the United Nations must engage in strenuous diplomacy with Beijing, which carries the most sway with Burma's generals, and urge the Chinese to press for reform. China has in its grasp a momentous opportunity  to demonstrate leadership commensurate with its growing power and status. Beijing can host the 2008 Olympics as an enabler of cruelty and repression or it can do so as a responsible stakeholder in the world community. The Olympics will not  masquerade or cover up for its absence from this challenge. This is an important test. The world is watching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the international community exerts greater pressure on the military junta, it must also reach out more aggressively with humanitarian assistance for the Burmese people. The people of Burma have suffered not only the bullets and bayonets of the current regime but also from decades of misrule that have transformed their resource-rich nation into one of the poorest in Asia. All you have to do is go to YouTube, and you can watch footage of the wedding of the general's daughter, one of the junta  general's daughters, laden in diamonds the size of pebbles, an example of the excesses of their coercion of power while the country gets poorer and poorer and people suffer as a consequence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of Burma's 52 million people live in abject misery. About one-third are mired in poverty. Nearly half of all the children never get to go to school. Malaria and tuberculosis are widespread. Mortality rates in Burma are among the highest in Asia. At least 37,000 died of HIV/AIDS in 2005 and over 600,000 are infected with HIV. Burma's suffering destabilizes southeast Asia--heroin and methamphetamines, HIV/AIDs, and other infectious diseases, as well as hordes of refugees spilling across Burma's  borders into neighboring countries. The international community must respond to this ongoing tragedy by providing humanitarian aid to a desperate and deserving people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current levels of international assistance are simply woefully insufficient. We need a network of public and private donors to fund health, education, and infrastructure projects. The resilient and brave Burmese people have shown that they are more than worthy of our support and compassion. They are fighting for democracy. We need to join that fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close by offering a final word of warning. We dare not forget Burma's last great democratic uprising. It occurred in 1988. It was brutally crushed by the military at the cost of over 3,000 innocent lives. That day and the repression that followed show the horrible human toll of our collective failure to act. A peaceful prodemocratic outcome in Burma is actually within reach, if the international community were to seize this moment. The United Nations, ASEAN, India, and especially China must  stand with the United States in solidarity with the Burmese people. All of us must not fail the people of Burma again.</paragraph>
