  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats took control of Congress this year, we pledged that the voices of children would become a top priority for a change. This month Democrats will complete a final budget that meets our commitment to our children and abides by tough pay-as-you-go rules we reinstituted in January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new Congress has a responsibility to clean up the fiscal mess that we inherited. Deficits matter. Over the last 6 years, the choice to live beyond our means has come at a great expense to our children who will be forced to pay off that debt. The Democratic budget says, enough with deficit spending. Unlike the President's budget, ours will be balanced within the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we increase funding for our children's health care by $50 billion  over the next 5 years, which will allow States to ensure millions of children who are now uninsured. And then we will provide $7.9 billion over the President's budget for education funding so we can really mean it when we say, No child left behind.</paragraph>
