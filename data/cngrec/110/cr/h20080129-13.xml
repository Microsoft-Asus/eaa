  <narrative>THE CHINESE CROCODILE -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H483]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Chinese attack on the Christian faith continues. For 60 days, the Chinese Government has held Shi Weiham, a Christian bookstore owner, in secret detention for praying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As China readies for the 2008 Summer Olympics, it is trying to convince critics that it embraces religious freedom. But China is secretly moving religious believers to the dark, damp, hidden hideaway of jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China restricts all religious practice to state-sanctioned churches and certain places of worship. So Chinese don't dare pray or worship anywhere else, or off to jail they go. That is what happened to Shi Weiham.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's religious tolerance is a public relations campaign draped in hypocrisy. China arrests thousands of Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As religion is being attacked across atheistic Communist China, we should recall Winston Churchill's words about communism: "A communist is like a crocodile, when it opens its mouth, you cannot tell whether it is trying to smile or preparing to eat you up." The Chinese crocodile is devouring religious freedom among its people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
