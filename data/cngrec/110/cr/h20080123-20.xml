    <paragraph>Today, I join my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to override the President's veto of <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, which the President vetoed on December 12. Since then, we received more discouraging news regarding the growing domestic and global economic crisis. It is imperative that we look at the impact of the downturn on our Nation's children. A slowing economy will definitely lead to an increased demand nationwide for SCHIP services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overriding the President's veto of SCHIP is more critical than ever during this period of economic downturn. I urge my colleagues to join me to override the President's veto and to guarantee that sufficient funding levels to address the need of our Nation's uninsured children become a reality.</paragraph>
