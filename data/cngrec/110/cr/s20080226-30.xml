  <narrative>LEAP YEAR CAPITAL OF THE WORLD -- (Senate - February 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1199">S1199</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="CI, DOMENI" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize Anthony, NM, today for being the Leap Year Capital of the World. A leap year only occurs once every 4 years, and is something to be celebrated. Anthony has taken this unique day and made it a staple celebration for their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty years ago in Anthony, two neighbors who shared a common birthday, February 29, decided they should find other people with the same unique situation and have a giant birthday party; after all, it only happens once every 4 years. Ma ry Ann Brown and Birdie Lewis created the Worldwide Leap Year Birthday Club which now has almost 500 members. Because of the popularity of the birthday club, they have also created the Worldwide Leap Year Anniversary Club for couples who celebrate their anniversaries</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Anthony Chamber of Commerce has planned several events this year for those with leap year birthdays and anniversaries and also for those with birthdays on the other 365 days of the year. The Worldwide Leap Year Fest ival will be kicked off with a parade, and then those attending will enjoy a leap year birthday dinner complete with birthday cake. Also in attendance will be Josephine Concho Abeita, a true New Mexico native, born in 1908, 4 years before New Mexico was even a State. Ms. Abeita</paragraph>
