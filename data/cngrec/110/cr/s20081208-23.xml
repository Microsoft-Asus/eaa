  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO LINDA LE -- (Senate - December 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10801">S10801</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding service Linda Le provided to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship over the past 4 years. Linda is a dedicated individual whose penchant for critical insights and creative solutions will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linda first joined the Senate Small Business Committee staff in 2004 as a staff assistant. She had previously gained invaluable experience on financial matters during her career at Fidelity Investments. Through hard work and determination here in the Senate, Linda rose through the ranks, first as a research analyst and finally as a professional staff member. Over the years,  I have come to rely on her knowledge and expertise in the areas of small business  lending, banking, and women's business issues. She is a thoughtful member of the Committee's staff who could be relied upon for her ideas on how to strengthen legislation to benefit our Nation's small business owners. Just this year, Linda played a pivotal role in helping me develop legislation to alleviate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The consummate professional, Linda was always well prepared for committee hearings, markups and roundtables. She consistently provided me with detailed materials that clearly explained complex situations and offered proactive and comprehensive solutions to problems regarding small business lending, access to credit, and women's business concerns. Linda's ability to build and maintain relationships with constituents, issue experts, and staff from other Members' offices has served me and the committee  well. In all her years on the Small Business Committee, Linda has been a passionate advocate for small businesses and their owners. Her eagerness to make a difference in people's lives is nothing short of commendable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After her tenure here in Washington, Linda is leaving the Senate to pursue a cause dear to her heart. Soon, she will be heading to Iraq to work as a business development specialist with one of the State Department's provincial reconstruction teams, or PRTs. PRTs are vital to our mission in Iraq, as they are made up of experts who advise the U.S. military and local Iraqi government on a wide array of issues, including economic and business development. Linda's work with the PRT will continue her  pursuit of serving others, and will help win the hearts and minds of Iraqis in need of this vital aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Linda Le is a person of remarkable strength and selflessness. And to make her story all the more compelling, her husband Hung, a communications officer in the U.S. Army National Guard, recently deployed to Afghanistan to serve our country in the war on terror. Clearly, the word "service" has a profound meaning in Linda's household. I speak for my entire staff when I say we will keep Linda and her husband in our thoughts and prayers during their time overseas, and we wish Linda safe travels  and much success in her new and incredible endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am sad to see Linda leave, I am excited for her bright future. She has used her talents to the fullest extent here in the Senate, and I am confident that she will continue to excel in everything she does. Thank you, Linda, for your dedicated service to your country, and best wishes as you begin an extraordinary new chapter in your life.</paragraph>
