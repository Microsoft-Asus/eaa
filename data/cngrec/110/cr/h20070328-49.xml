  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise as the Health Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus to express my strong support for the Congressional Black Caucus' alternative fiscal year `08 budget and to urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin by applauding our leadership, our chairwoman, Carolyn Kilpatrick, and the person who headed up our Budget Task Force for his hard work, skill, leadership and commitment to justice it represents, Congressman Bobby Scott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a smart and responsible budget that is as fiscally sound as it is congruent to the needs, hopes and aspirations not only of African Americans, but of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget uses the Democratic budget, a good budget itself, as a starting point and takes a step further by putting $112 billion more in education, training, employment and social services; $9 billion more in veterans benefits and services; $8 billion more in homeland security. And over a 5-year period, it spends more than $101 billion on health care. It does all of this and more while balancing the budget in 2012 and creating $141 billion surplus, beginning to reduce the burden that the Republican  spending spree would have placed on future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four years ago, the current administration began taking us down the slippery slope of huge deficits and unprecedented debt by giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans instead of using that money to strengthen our country by investing in the American people. This budget rescinds some of those tax cuts and incentives, including the tax cuts to the top two tiers of income, tax cuts that this country could not afford then and cannot afford today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By rescinding those tax cuts, which is where our budget departs from the Democratic base budget, we begin now to correct the wrong that was perpetrated particularly on the poor and middle class, and we put the interests of the majority of this Nation's hardworking families at the forefront of our spending priorities, and Mr. Speaker, it is about time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this is true across every line item, it is especially true as it relates to spending on health and health care. As I have previously observed and stated on the Record, the President's fiscal year 2008 budget proposes to eliminate, cut or flat fund every single program that is critical to reducing health disparities or to strengthening the health and wellness of African Americans and other people of color across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic budget, for which I applaud Chairman John Spratt, does much to restore these programs, at least in part. But the health deficit of African Americans and other people of color, of the poor and rural Americans requires a major investment to reverse the severely adverse impact of long-term neglect, neglect which is not only causing excess deaths, but driving up the cost of health care and undermining the quality of care for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, the CBC alternative budget uses the additional funding stream from the funds we put back into the budget to maintain, create or expand programs that are proven to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities that have left more people of color in poorer health, without access to adequate health care, and more likely to die prematurely from preventable causes often during their most productive years for far too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Programs like Healthy Start, nurse education and other health profession programs, the Ryan-White Care Act, Health Careers Opportunity programs, Gulf Coast Health Infrastructure, Maternal and Child Health get the funding they need. And NIH and community health centers get an additional increase as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, we create a health equity fund to fund prevention programs that pay for themselves and create value, and which make that investment to fill in the gaps in health care in poor and rural communities and communities of color, and to improve the health status of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The CBC budget through its investment in education, economic opportunity, housing, and all of the social determinants of health provide that kind of holistic approach to our communities and our Nation's well-being that had been missing and for which we are all, but especially people of color, paying the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King once said that the moral arc of the universe bends at the elbow of justice. The CBC resets the moral compass of our Nation, and the CBC sits at the elbow of justice. And by supporting the CBC budget we not only will be championing justice and equity in health care but in all social, public and economic policies and programs that currently fail far too many of our Nation's citizens and which have thus created two Americas separated by a wide and deep chasm of  inequality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King also said that the time is always right to do what is right. Well, that time is now, and doing what is right is passing the CBC alternative budget. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this well-constructed, sound budget that sets a new direction for this country not just for today but for tomorrow.</paragraph>
