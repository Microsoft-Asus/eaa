  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business. I ask unanimous consent that it be a full hour of morning business because I am going to have to go into a quorum call in a minute to wait for one of my colleagues to come. We have some business to transact in the Senate, and I want to make sure there is somebody here to do that. So I ask unanimous consent that there be a full hour of morning business.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
