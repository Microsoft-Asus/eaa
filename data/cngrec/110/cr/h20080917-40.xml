    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="6627">H.R. 6627</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6627">H.R. 6627</bill>, the Smithsonian Facilities Authorization Act of 2008. This bill has bipartisan support, including support from Congresswoman Matsui, Congressman Becerra, and Congressman Johnson, who are Smithsonian regents. Majority Leader Hoyer and Ranking Member Mica are also in support of authorizing construction funding of these two renowned and vital Smithsonian facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mathias Research Center located in Edgewater, Maryland, is a global leader in the study of ecosystems in coastal zones. It was established in the 1930s on a dairy farm in Edgewater, Maryland. Nearly one-half of SERC's 146 employees and fellows conduct the majority of their work in trailers. A major part of SERC's mission is research and professional training of the next generation of environmental scientists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution requested authority to design and construct laboratory space to accommodate the Mathias Laboratory at SERC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Board requested authority to upgrade and replace the facility to eliminate unsafe trailers and address substandard, inefficient labs. The facility and its support spaces need to be replaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, located in Mathias Research Center, Panama, is the principal United States organization devoted to research in tropical biology which will advance scientific study and improve human welfare. Ecological catastrophes such as drought, starvation, and flooding caused by deforestation and overpopulation of tropical regions are studied for causes and remedies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This facility is a world-renowned research and education center dedicated to research and analysis of tropical ecosystems. The Board of Regents requested authority to replace current science building structure that is heavily infested with termites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support these projects and the Board of Regents' request for construction authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6627">H.R. 6627</bill> authorizes construction of permanent structures to serve as Smithsonian research facilities in Edgewater, Maryland, and Gamboa, Panama. The new buildings will replace aging leased and temporary structure, and provide needed research space for the Smithsonian's research mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of a comprehensive facilities management plan, the Smithsonian has identified these two research centers as facilities in need of permanent, modern research buildings. The construction of the laboratories authorized by this bill will enable the Smithsonian to reduce its leased space inventory and consolidate its research operations. This will also allow the Smithsonian to close 80-year-old buildings that are costly to operate and not suitable for renovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Construction of new facilities in Gamboa will allow the Smithsonian to move out of general office space reconfigured for research and consolidate operations into a government-owned structure more appropriate and less costly for a modern research facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Edgewater, Maryland, research facility will finally have permanent structures after working for many years out of temporary trailers. These trailers are expensive to maintain, and have a short, useful life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the new buildings will be government-owned and cost less to operate and maintain, this legislation is expected to save money in the long term. The new facilities will be designed to meet the specific needs of the research centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Government ownership of the structures will save taxpayer dollars by investing in assets that will continue to serve the Smithsonian Institution over time. The dilapidated buildings and trailers currently used consume building maintenance resources and are a liability to the government rather than an asset. Replacement of the old buildings will allow us to shift dollars from maintaining aging structures to creating modern, useful facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am encouraged by the Smithsonian's responsible property management decisions in these two cases, and I ask my colleagues to please join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="6627">H.R. 6627</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6627">H.R. 6627</bill>, the "Smithsonian Facilities Authorization Act of 2008".</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6627">H.R. 6627</bill> authorizes the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to design and construct laboratory space to accommodate the Mathias Laboratory at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center ("SERC") in Edgewater, Maryland. The bill also authorizes the Board of Regents to construct laboratory space to accommodate the terrestrial research program of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute ("STRI") in Gamboa, Panama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SERC is a global leader in the study of ecosystems in coastal zones. Founded on the site of an abandoned 1930s dairy farm in Edgewater, Maryland, the SERC facilities include farm buildings, the Mathias Laboratory, 10 temporary trailers, an administrative building, and a variety of lab support spaces. Nearly one-half of SERC's 146 employees and fellows conduct the majority of their work in trailers. A major part of SERC's mission is to conduct research and professional training of the next  generation of environmental scientists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution requested authority to design and construct laboratory space to accommodate the Mathias Laboratory at SERC. The Board requested authority to upgrade and replace the facility to eliminate unsafe trailers and address substandard, inefficient labs. The facility and its support spaces need to be replaced. The bill authorizes a total of $41 million for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 to design and construct the Mathias Laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute is located in Gamboa, Panama. STRI is the principal United States organization devoted to research in tropical biology. Both scientific advancement and human welfare depend on a continuing commitment to research in tropical biology for such things as finding untapped tropical resources to add to the important supply of food, pharmaceuticals, and fiber that we already get from the tropics, and to give us a better understanding of how to avoid further  ecological catastrophes such as drought, starvation, and flooding caused by deforestation and overpopulation of tropical regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The STRI facility is a world-renowned research and education center dedicated to research and analysis of tropical ecosystems. The Board of Regents requested authority to replace current science building structure that is heavily infested with termites. The bill authorizes a total of $14 million for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to construct the laboratory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the past two years, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has worked to address numerous management shortfalls. I look forward to working with the Board of Regents and the new Secretary of the Smithsonian, Secretary G. Wayne Clough, as we continue to work together to improve the Smithsonian's management practices and carry out James Smithson's mandate of 1826: "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Ranking Member Mica, Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton, Committee on House Administration Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Ehlers, the Smithsonian Congressional Regents, Mr. Becerra, Ms. Matsui, and Mr. Johnson of Texas, and Majority Leader Hoyer for their support in authorizing construction funding of these two vital Smithsonian facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="6627">H.R. 6627</bill>, the "Smithsonian Institution Facilities Authorization Act of 2008".-</paragraph>
