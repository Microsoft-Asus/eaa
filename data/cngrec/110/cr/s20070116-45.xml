    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate has voted on two amendments relating to earmarks that were approved unanimously by a vote of 98 to 0. Plus, the Senate voted to invoke cloture on the Reid amendment regarding travel and corporate jets. I understand there are several second-degree amendments that were filed, and we hope to address any germane second-degree amendments prior to disposing of the travel amendment. Once we dispose of the travel amendment, then we will have a cloture vote on the  substitute amendment.</paragraph>
