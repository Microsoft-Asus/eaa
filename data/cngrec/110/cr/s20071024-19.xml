    <paragraph>Madam President, in the last couple of hours, the President took the opportunity to speak at the State Department on the condition of relations between the United States and Cuba. For me, as an immigrant from Cuba, born on that island and an immigrant to this country, it was a very moving and transcending kind of moment. The President, for the first time, I think, in many years that any American President might do this, detailed the problems in Cuba and the cruelty of that regime  toward its own people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President put a human face on the suffering of the Cuban people by inviting to the stage with him three families of Cuban political prisoners. These families, each with their own tale of hardship and suffering, were representatives of what I think is the now almost half century long suffering of the Cuban people. He spoke about their plight, the unjust nature of their relatives' incarceration, which is nothing more than a representative sampling of what the Cuban people have suffered over  so many years of brutal repression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also detailed the many failed promises of the Cuban revolution toward its own people. He spoke of the failed promises; that the revolution would bring a better life and so many other things that have simply not occurred. He detailed frankly, the economic misery the Cuban people suffer from today, the fact that housing is deplorable and difficult and that many families have to, obviously, live together. He spoke about the irony that while the Cuban system touts the greatness of their medical  prowess; in fact the Cuban people do not have access to the kind of quality medical care that medical tourists can obtain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as an anecdote, sitting next to me was a foreign diplomat who mentioned to me that she had been to Cuba for eye surgery some years earlier. I mentioned to her that at about that same time--I think she said that was in 1992--I had a relative, an uncle of mine, whom we had brought to this country so he could have eye surgery here because he couldn't get it in Cuba. So foreign visitors, for dollar amounts, can get first-rate medical care in Cuba, but it is not always available to the Cuban  people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He spoke about the oppression of those who seek to be a voice for change and the fact that many of those in prison, these patriots, are in prison for nothing more than having a fax machine in their home or a willingness to speak and talk about the human rights conditions on the island. The fact is that each of these brave souls takes great risk in order to facilitate the opportunity for Cubans to speak to one another, for the opportunity to speak in freedom, the opportunity to freely express  an idea. These are things which are abhorrent to the Cuban regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President made an offer. He made an offer that the United States, through non-governmental organizations and religious entities, would send computers and provide Internet access to the Cuban people, if only the Cuban Government would allow the average, everyday Cuban--what today is part of international trade, commerce, and communications--Internet access. Internet access in Cuba today is only allowed under the strictest of Government authority, and it is a way in which the Cuban people are  held back from achieving the promise that the 21st century has for so many people, in so many other places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also spoke about the opportunity for Cuban children to be a part of a scholarship program and all they would have to do is to be freely allowed to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He spoke to the international community using the example of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, which have, with such determination, stood clearly on the side of freedom, stood clearly on the side of those in Cuba  who are not satisfied with the current conditions but look to the moment of their liberty, look to the moment of freedom. These new democracies in Europe, who still well remember the days of their oppression at the hands of another Communist  dictator, are very much involved in helping the Cuban dissident movement, in allowing them to come to their embassies and just stand in their lobbies and have access to a magazine or a newspaper or a book that would otherwise not be permitted by the Cuban authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can all do more. The United States has been at the forefront of assistance to a free Cuba, but no doubt many other countries, many other capitals across the world could well heed the example these Eastern European governments are today giving to the rest of the world as they stand clearly on the side of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that the most important take-away, if you will, that I heard today in this very moving, emotional, and I thought historic speech was the fact that the President today said that in the future of Cuba, we should be clearly on the side of freedom and not on the side of stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, the Cuban people are in the throes of change. Change is happening on that imprisoned island today, and that change can take one of several forms. One of them would be for us to side with stability and more of the same, for the sake of  stability. The other would be to chart that uncertain path that freedom often brings but a path that ultimately leads to the opportunity for free people to live freely, that opportunity to simply stand in a town square and speak your mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So often people ask me: Have you ever been back to Cuba?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I say: No.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They ask: Will you ever go back?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I say: Yes, I will go back the day I can stand in the park of my little town where I grew up, in Sagua La Grande, Cuba, and stand there and freely express my thoughts or the day I can pick up a book and read it freely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the times and those are the conditions under which the Cuban people will really begin to taste freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of Latin America today in one measure or another is moving to the march of democratic governments and clearly enjoying the fruits of a free market. The free-trade agreements currently pending with Latin American countries will only continue to expand the wave of prosperity that is today sweeping that continent. But one example remains, one example of absolute tyranny, one example of an old-fashioned, brutal military dictator, and that is Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, I do believe freedom is on the march and that freedom can come to the Cuban people. I hope we can continue to encourage the voices of freedom within the island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President spoke to the military, he spoke to the governmental structures of the Cuban Government, and he pleaded with them to side with the people of Cuba who seek to live free and not use the elements of repression at a critical and decisive moment in the future of Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no doubt that many of those who today might have been, at one time, supporters of the Cuban regime, who believed in the promises of the revolution, as at one time or another all of us did, that they would now understand that this failed system has a limited lifespan and that it is time to side with the forces of freedom and not with the forces of repression and tyranny. For those who have no blood on their hands, they do have a future in a free Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the more touching moments today was when the President discussed dissidents, such as Oscar Elias Biscet. Oscar Elias Biscet is a physician who has been sentenced, to I believe 20 years, for merely speaking and expressing his own beliefs and his desire to see a change within Cuba. He is in deplorable conditions, in rat-infested conditions, needing medical care and getting none. He is the face of the future of Cuba. He is the face of the dissidents in Cuba. He is a young man, born and raised  under the Castro regime. He does not belong to any rich families of the past. In fact, he happens to be an Afro-Cuban. He is a physician. He believes in life at all stages, from conception to death, and that was one of the big sins for which he has been punished in Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would say that today is an important day in the history of U.S. relations with Cuba. I hope it will also be a historic marker for the future of the Cuban people. The President spoke about a popular song, both in Cuba and outside, and it basically talks about "our day is coming." I don't think there is any doubt that the freedom of the Cuban people is coming and that our day, without a doubt, is coming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to help the dissident movement inside Cuba in any way that we can, to continuing to help the voices of freedom that so much yearn for an opportunity. I believe the President made it clear that the standard by which we should judge our future relations with Cuba is the way in which the Cuban Government treats its own people; by releasing political prisoners, by allowing freedom of expression, by allowing freedom of the press, and by ending these despicable acts of  repression or repudiation, which are nothing more than a government-organized gang of neighbors ganging up on someone who, for whatever reason, seems to be out of step with the orthodoxy of the Government of the day. These are horrible beatings and harassment that cut across age groups. It is not just about the head of the household who has expressed himself in a way the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When people talk about what is going to be the future, the future is in the hands of the Cuban people. I know the United States will stand clearly on the side of freedom. That is, what makes our country so very different and so very special, is the fact we do put freedom first; that we do put a value on every human being, every human life, and the dignity of each one; that we do understand there is a difference between freedom and oppression and we choose to stand clearly on the side of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always be proud to stand with our President, who so clearly spoke today about his desire to stand on the side of freedom. I hope many of my colleagues in the Senate will take the time to read the speech the President gave today. If you care about Latin America, if you care about Cuba, if you care about the future of that oppressed island, I think this was a very good moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see my dear colleague from New Jersey and fellow Cuban American here on the Senate floor, and I know we share the same passion for the opportunity for Cuba to be free. This isn't a partisan issue between us; this is about the right of the Cuban people to live freely. I say to Senator Menendez that it was a momentous speech and I think one that will be a historic marker, as I said, in the relations between our countries and the opportunity for the Cuban people to live in freedom. I  think it was an important moment, and I hope my colleague will have an opportunity to see it and read it. It was the kind of speech so many of us have wished for and were delighted to hear today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I come to the floor primarily to speak about a vote we took earlier today on the DREAM Act. I do appreciate my distinguished colleague from Florida's comments about the President's speech. We look forward to getting a further focus on what the President had to say. We certainly appreciate any movement, any policy that tries to create an opportunity for freedom for the people of Cuba, for them to be able to achieve what we enjoy here in the United States--the right  to choose our Representatives, to worship at the altar that we chose freely, to be able to associate with others freely, to be able to protest when we believe our Government is moving in the wrong direction. We have freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of speech. All of those things are denied the Cuban people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, the efforts the President speaks about, trying to move in the direction that creates that moment in which those freedoms can be fulfilled for the people of Cuba, we applaud.</paragraph>
