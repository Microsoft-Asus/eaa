  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the second time we have overwhelmingly and on a bipartisan basis passed a bill to provide health insurance for 10 million American children by reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation presents another opportunity for President Bush to show the American people that he values the well-being of our Nation's children. After all, the President has often said that he is a "compassionate conservative."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, he failed the first time, and I was hopeful that the House could override his ill-advised veto. But, unfortunately, we came up 13 votes short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are here again today passing a revised bill that sufficiently addresses the stated concerns of those who opposed the earlier bill. Those concerns really amount to little more than empty rhetoric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than complain, House leadership compromised on phasing out health care insurance for childless adults from 2 years to 1 year. The bill we passed today clarified that CHIP will focus first on enrolling low-income children by capping the enrollment level at 300 percent of the poverty level, or $62,000 for a family of four.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also added language to clarify that CHIP does not cover illegal immigrants by requiring States to obtain further documentation of citizenship that cannot be confirmed by the Social Security Administration. And in addition to doing those things, creating new options for States to develop and expand premium assistance programs designed to keep children and their parents in an employer-sponsored plan, the new bill contains a provision adding premium assistance programs to the list of things a  State can do to receive bonuses. It will also now require all States to develop plans and implement recommended best practices for minimizing crowd-out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. None of these fixes were necessary under the original CHIP bill, which already contained provisions addressing these very issues. But these were concerns raised by some Members and the President; so we clarified the language for them. There can now be no question as to whether this bill should be supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to addressing the concerns that have been raised, it contains several excellent provisions for our children. It insures dental coverage and mental health parity, including guaranteed dental benefits that I offered in response to the death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died when a tooth infection spread to his brain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also provides $100 million in grants for new outreach activities to States, local governments, schools, community-based organizations, safety-net providers, and others. And it improves a new quality child health initiative to  develop and implement quality measures and improve State reporting of quality data.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent national poll from CBS News finds that 81 percent of the American people support this bipartisan legislation, including large majorities of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard many of my colleagues say that they wanted more time to review the bill, but we have already debated the issue more than was necessary. We are acting expeditiously because the short-term fix CHIP expires on November 16 and we cannot allow the 6 million children who are currently enrolled in the program to lose their coverage because we cannot make up our minds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to health of our children, there is no time for uncertainty. That is why I am glad that we were able to pass the legislation a few minutes ago. And I strongly urge the Senate and President to follow suit with a great sense of urgency. This urgency is needed because there are 10 million very good reasons why we should support this legislation. As I have often said, our children are the living messages we send to a future we will never see. I think we ought to be about the business  of urgently making sure that we send children into the future who are healthy.</paragraph>
