    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's talk just for a moment about what the impact would be if the Democrats' plan to arbitrarily impose draconian fuel standards on our domestic automobile industry were to be enacted. First of all, our cars would get smaller, less safe, more expensive and more likely to be built in foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because American automobile companies lose money on every American-built small car, these vehicles would have to be built in low-wage foreign countries like Mexico, China, Korea or Japan. More American automobile workers will lose their jobs. In order to meet the new Federal regulations, experts suggest prices will be going up by more than $6,000 per vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats' CAFE proposal is nothing more than a stealth tax on American families and businesses. It will put smaller, less safe cars on our roadways, increasing traffic injuries and deaths, and the efforts to reduce our dependence on foreign oil will be outsourced to cheap foreign labor. Does that sound like a good plan to you?</paragraph>
