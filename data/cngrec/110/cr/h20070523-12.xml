    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, "amnesty" is a trigger word for most Americans. While we as a people disagree on many issues, most Americans oppose the thought of legalization of illegal conduct; in other words, amnesty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the special-interest groups and the profiteers from plantation labor have been careful not to call the new, inclusive immigration proposal amnesty. But that's exactly what it is. It legalizes the illegals that are in America, some 12- to 20 million. All they need to do is a few things, including pay a fee, or as I see it, a government kickback, and they get to stay in America. But supporters of this proposal still refuse to accept the obvious: It's amnesty, or pardon for illegal conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If somebody trespasses on your land, when they are caught they usually have to pay a fine, but they also must get off your property. If they pay the fine and are allowed to continue to stay on your property, it is amnesty. This is similar to what the special-interest groups are trying to repackage and sell to the American public and even illegal immigrants. But it seems to me these groups are selling out America. We shall see what the American public think.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
