    <paragraph>You know, Mr. Speaker, Alan Jackson lives in my district, a great country singer, and I was thinking of some songs for him. One of them was "I Would Rather Be in New York Raising Money Than Funding the War in Iraq." The other one was "How I Turned the Blue Dogs Yellow."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is also an author in my district, Ferrell Sams; he writes a lot of books; you may have read some of them, but a good book is "How to Lose a War and Store Peanuts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this, Mr. Speaker, for Alan Jackson to look at the rules. And he could do a whole album on the rules here. "We Only Change Them When We Have To" would make a great title for that rules album. "We Only Leave the Vote Open When We Are Losing, When the Time is Up," would be another good one. And the last one would be, "We Only Change Them When We Have To."</paragraph>
