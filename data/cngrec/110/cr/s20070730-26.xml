    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to honor and give special attention to the 50th annual Bat Flight Celebration Breakfast, at New Mexico's beautiful Carlsbad Caverns. Every evening over 300,000 Mexican free-tail bats exit the caves to feed, only to return in the early morning hours. It is in these early morning hours, once a year, that visitors gather to observe the return of these thousands of bats to their homes inside these incredible caves. On Saturday July 28, 2007, for the 50th  time, over 600 visitors gathered and enjoyed a New Mexican breakfast while witnessing this magnificent in-flight return to the cave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Created by inland sea between 250 and 280 million years ago, the limestone caves of Carlsbad were declared a national monument in 1923, and the surrounding area was made a national park in 1930, in order to preserve its unique beauty and geology. Carlsbad Caverns National Park has more than 100 known caves and covers over 46,000 acres, with approximately 33,000 acres designated as wilderness. The park's most prominent feature is the cavern itself, which contains one of the world's largest underground  chambers and countless spectacular geological formations, many of which are easily accessible along a 3-mile paved underground trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next time you happen to be in New Mexico, I encourage you to come visit and take some time to enjoy all New Mexico has to offer. From the beautiful rock formations, the stalagmites and stalactites, the wildlife, the culture and the history--the unique caverns near Carlsbad, NM, have it all. New Mexico is a great place, and the Carlsbad Caverns help make it so. To all, past and present, who have worked hard to preserve Carlsbad Caverns and showcase the annual bat flight celebration, I extend  a heartfelt thank you.</paragraph>
