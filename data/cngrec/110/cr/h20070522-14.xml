  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, congressional Democrats accomplished something the Republican "do-nothing" Congress could not do. We passed a final budget through both the House and Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 3 of the last 5 years, the Republican-led Congress failed to reach agreement on a final budget resolution, leading to unparalleled deficit spending. Unlike our Republican predecessors, this new Democratic Congress has produced a fiscally responsible budget that serves as a blueprint for investing in America's priorities, providing tax cuts to middle-class families, and balances the budget in just 5 years without raising taxes. Not even the President's proposed budget comes out of the red  after 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, budgets serve as a blueprint of a Congress' priorities. Our final budget strengthens our military readiness and invests in our troops and veterans. It also spurs innovation to boost our economy and expands investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce global warming and our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats vowed to run this Congress differently, and we have, by producing a final budget agreement.</paragraph>
