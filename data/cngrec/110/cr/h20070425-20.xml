  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Bush, CHENEY and their Republican apologists here in Congress say "hands off their war. Leave it to the professionals."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, if they followed their own advice, we wouldn't be at war in Iraq. Remember CHENEY and Scooter Libby, who is on his way to prison, phonying up intelligence, overruling the intelligence and military professionals, saying there was a threat, that there were weapons of mass destruction? They didn't exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they fired General Shinseki because he had the temerity to suggest if we didn't put in 400,000 troops, there would be a massive insurgency and a civil war. They fired him. If they had not fired General Shinseki, if they followed his professional advice, our troops wouldn't be mired in the middle of a civil war; and Paul Bremer disbanding the Iraq Army, de-Baathification, against all professional military and intelligence advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the Republican lapdogs have the temerity to say "hands off Bush's war. Let the professionals run it." Well, it is time for some adults to step in here and really take advice from the professionals and get our troops out of the middle of this civil war.</paragraph>
