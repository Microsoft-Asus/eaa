    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn an unconscionable commercial from last night's Super Bowl. Some ads were good, some ads were bad; but this one was very ugly. For those who missed it, an antiwar political action committee ran an ad claiming, and this is a direct quote: "If you support escalation, you don't support the troops."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Speaker, that couldn't be farther from the truth. Supporting additional troops in Iraq is supporting one final surge to push the Iraqi people over the threshold of violence and deliver the best shot for a more stable Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me assure you that the veterans in this commercial do not speak for the veterans in my district, nor do they speak for the soldiers that I visited in Iraq or Walter Reed, nor do they speak for our military commanders. But, Mr. Speaker, what disturbs me most about this commercial is that it wasn't just broadcast to those of us watching the game from the comfort of our living rooms and our homes. It was broadcast to the troops watching the game in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops should know that the United States military strategy will not be determined by political groups buying air time during the Super Bowl. I support victory in Iraq, and this final surge may be our best last chance to achieve it.</paragraph>
