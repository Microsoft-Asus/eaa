    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to publicly condemn the recent remarks of Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader of the United States Senate. For the leader of one of the greatest legislative bodies in the world to concede defeat in Iraq is a sad commentary on the state of politics in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops are the finest fighting force this world has ever known. Our generals are among the finest military minds in the world. My faith is with these brave men and women who put their lives on the line each day in battle, and not on the political choices of a Washington, DC politician.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public does not want our troops to shuffle out of Iraq with our tails between our legs. America wants to achieve victory in the global war for freedom, a battle whose center is in the Middle East and in Iraq. Defeatist comments like "the war is lost" should be condemned by any freedom-loving Member of this body.</paragraph>
