  <narrative>THE FARM BILL -- (Senate - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14359">S14359</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about the status of the farm bill because I was stunned, obviously, today to find that the majority leader--after for 2 weeks, almost, refusing to allow any amendments to the farm bill--has now decided to file cloture on the farm bill and claim this is the way things are done in the Senate. That is a statement which is pretty hard to accept with a straight face: the concept that the majority leader would set up a process in the Senate which,  essentially, made him the gatekeeper of all amendments to a major authorization and appropriations bill--appropriations in the sense it has mandatory spending in it--so that any Member of the Senate who wanted to offer an amendment would have to go through the majority</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard innumerable, wonderful speeches from the senior Senator from West Virginia, the keeper, basically, of the flame of the integrity of the Senate, Mr. Byrd, on the importance of the amendment process in the Senate. I happen to subscribe to that, as I thought every Member of the Senate subscribed to that, that the greatness of the Senate is that if we put a piece of legislation on the floor, which is a significant piece of public policy, we debate it, we hear ideas on it, then  we vote on those different ideas, and then we vote on passage. We do not lock down a bill and not allow any amendments to occur on that bill except those that are accepted on the majority side and by the majority leader and then say to the minority: Well, because you would not accept our process of locking down the amendment process, we are going to file cloture to shut you out completely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That truly is an autocratic level which this Senate has never seen. Let me tell you something, it puts us on a slippery slope. It is very possible--in fact, I hope likely--that the other side of the aisle may not be in the majority forever around here and maybe not even through the next election. Certainly, if they continue to produce such a dysfunctional legislative calendar, as they have over the last year, I would think the American people would get a little frustrated and ask for a change.  But they have now opened the door to running the Senate as an autocratic system, as a dictatorial system where the rights of 99 Members of the Senate are made completely subservient to 1 Member, which is the majority leader, because he has the right of recognition, he fills up the tree, and then when he does not like the amendments, he files cloture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about some of the amendments he does not want us to hear on this bill relative to the farm bill. He does not want an amendment offered which would say to farm families, especially to mothers in farm families: You will have access to OB/GYNs. That is one of the amendments I intended to offer. It would simply say that OB/GYNs who practice in farm and rural communities would be immune from excessive liability and lawsuits from trial lawyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know for a fact we have lost most of our OB/GYNs in rural America. These baby doctors cannot practice in rural America because there are not enough clients for them to generate enough revenue to pay the cost of their malpractice insurance, which is generated by these lawsuits from trial lawyers. Well, the other side of the aisle is a kept group for the trial lawyers, so they do not want anything that could happen around here that might limit the income of trial lawyers, including allowing  baby doctors to deliver babies in rural America to farm families. So they are not going to allow me to offer that amendment. What an outrage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They do not want an amendment which would give firefighters in this country the right to bargain in order to reach agreement on contracts. Now, I do not think fires just burn in cities. Farmers have fires. In fact, if you look at what is happening in the West with wildfires, there are a lot of issues of fires for farmers in this country, especially silo fires. I know. I come from an area where there are occasional silo fires. They need firefighters. But the other side of the aisle does not want  to hear about an amendment that deals with firefighters' rights. No. They want to lock that amendment out of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They want to lock out of the process an amendment which would address the issue of people who are caught up in this terrible mortgage crisis we have. There are a lot of farmers, I suspect, and a lot of Americans generally who did not know how these ARMs worked when they went into these deals, and they are now finding they are being refinanced at a level where they cannot keep their homes because their interest rates are jumping up into the double-digit levels. When those homes are foreclosed  on, they get a double whammy of getting hit by the IRS with what is known as a recognized gain, even though they did not have any income because their home got foreclosed on. This is a really difficult thing to do to someone, whether you are a farmer or just an average</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was going to suggest we take up an amendment which might look at some of these new commodities that were put into this bill, such as the asparagus program and the camellia program and the chickpea program, but we do not want to hear about that. No, we do not want to address those issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not want to address the issue of the fact that this bill has in it $10 billion--$10 billion--of gamesmanship on moving dates so they can make this bill look more affordable and less costly. They don't want to have an amendment on that which might make the bill honest on its face. They don't want to hear that amendment. They don't want to hear this amendment, which is sort of ironic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have put in this bill what is called walking-around money--walking-around money--for the farm States in this country, actually for five farm States, called a $5 billion disaster loan fund. The way we have always handled disaster loans for the farm community--and they have them, and they are legitimate--is we have simply passed an emergency bill around here to cover the disaster when the disaster occurs. But what this bill does is set up a new fund which will be a floor, essentially, which  says there is $5 billion in this kitty sitting over here for which if there is a disaster, you take this money too. What is the practical implication of that? Every wind storm that occurs in North Dakota that blows over a mailbox is going to be declared a disaster so they can get some of this money. It is putting money on the table that is just going to be used up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know we are going to fund disasters when they occur. Why would we prefund disasters in a way that is going to make it absolutely guaranteed that a disaster will occur, even if there is not a disaster? Well, we don't want to have an amendment which says: Let's take that disaster money and move it over to IDEA, special education. There is an account that needs some more money. There is an account which would give relief to a lot of families in this country, a lot of small towns in this country,  farm communities and other communities that have a huge burden of IDEA in special education. Let's take that $5 billion out of that emergency account and, rather than having walking-around money for the five States that usually get this emergency money, use it for IDEA, which will benefit all the States in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They don't want to hear those amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is incredible that on a bill of this size--one of the biggest bills we deal with as a Congress, one of the most important pieces of public policy we deal with--the other side of the aisle and the majority leader have specifically set up a procedure where amendments will not be tolerated--simply won't be tolerated. Totally inappropriate. I think basically what the other side of the aisle wants to do is kill this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, from my perspective, this is not a good bill, and I am going to be voting against it. But I know it is going to pass if it is given a legitimate shot at  passage because there are a lot of people around here who have these different commodities, and they all vote for each other, and, as a result, they build up enough votes to pass this bill. That is the way the farm bill always works. But that is no reason why we should not have a chance to debate  it, to address some of these issues, such as baby doctors in rural communities and farm communities, such as the need for firefighters to have adequate bargaining rights, such as the need for people who are getting foreclosed on not getting hit with an IRS bill, such as the need to have proper accounting on this bill for what they are actually spending, such as the need for not setting up a $5 billion walking-around money fund,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the majority seems to want to kill this bill, which is unfortunate, because in the end, this bill should at least get a fair hearing.</paragraph>
