    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the success and triumph of Ryan Newman, winner of the 2008 Daytona 500. Born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, Ryan serves as a shining example to young men and women who aspire to achieve great success after long hours of work and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ryan's younger years were spent learning about cars at the elbow of his dad and developing the team spirit he's created to this day. He was an honors graduate of LaSalle High School and also a graduate of Purdue University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supported by his family, his community, nationwide fans, and a great team, Ryan won the 50th running of the Daytona 500, the Super Bowl of NASCAR. In a race with 16 different leaders and 42 lead changes, Ryan prevailed because of persistence and skill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my pleasure to pay tribute to the many years of hard work and dedication that have paid off for Ryan Newman, a model Hoosier. The Second District is proud of his success and of one of its hardest-working sons, a man who serves as a role model for youth throughout the country.</paragraph>
