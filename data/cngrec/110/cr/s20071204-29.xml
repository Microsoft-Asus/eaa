  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO STAN GARNETT -- (Senate - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14737">S14737</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, in a few days Stan Garnett will retire from the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, after 35 years of tremendous service to people in our Nation and elsewhere in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stan's experience and dedication to fighting hunger and malnutrition extends beyond his 35 years with the Department of Agriculture. Following his graduation from college, Stan answered President Kennedy's call to service abroad and spent 2 years in the Peace Corps in the Philippines. Thereafter, he joined Catholic Relief Services and spent 6 years administering food assistance programs in Southeast Asia and in Africa under tremendously difficult circumstances. He often traveled by helicopter  in battle zones in Vietnam to deliver food assistance to war refugees, and he also provided food aid in Nigeria during the tragic Biafran conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his work overseas, Stan returned to the United States and joined the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1971. Over the years, Stan held many different positions within the Food and Nutrition Service, the majority of them pertaining to legislative and regulatory policy in Federal child nutrition programs. Throughout his career, Stan served with accomplishment and, not surprisingly, continued a steady ascent in the ranks at the Food and Nutrition Service  of the Department of Agriculture, eventually serving as the Director of Supplemental Food Programs and Director of the Child Nutrition Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stan fulfilled those positions with great competence, but with integrity and humility as well. In 9 cases out of 10, Stan knows more about the issue at hand than anyone else in the room, but he never acts as if this is the case. Stan treats everyone equally--Members of Congress, members of his own staff, and the many people across the country who for so long have relied on Stan's expertise to help them operate child nutrition programs in their own communities. Stan is known by all who come in  contact with him as a generous and caring administrator who is trusted by all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 35 years of Federal service, there is no question that Stan has certainly earned a much-deserved retirement. His absence will certainly be acutely felt, both within the Department of Agriculture and here in Congress. However, I have no doubt that one of Stan's biggest contributions is to leave child nutrition programs in the hands of capable colleagues who have benefited, as I have over the years, from his tremendous expertise, and who will ensure a smooth transition as new leadership assumes  his responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In so many respects, the Stan Garnett who will retire this year is strikingly similar to the Stan Garnett who took up President Kennedy's call to service by entering the Peace Corps as a young man. His commitment to ending hunger and to promoting the economic security and nutrition of low-income families is as strong today as it was as a bright-eyed college graduate. Just as important, he has imparted this same idealism and commitment to numerous young people who have had the privilege to work  with him over the years. To those who question what a career in public service can accomplish, I ask only that they look to Stan's career. What they will see in him is not just 40 years of service, but a call to action. I have no doubt that, because of his incredible commitment, Stan is a remarkable inspiration and example of heeding this call to action and public service.</paragraph>
