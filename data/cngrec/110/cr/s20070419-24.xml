  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, earlier today the Senate passed <bill type="s" number="378">S. 378</bill>, the Court Security Improvement Act, with overwhelming, bipartisan support. With this legislation, we in the Senate acted for the third time in a year to better protect our Federal judges from institutional and physical threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past several years, I have introduced and sponsored legislation to extend the authority for Federal judges to redact relevant portions of their financial disclosure statements if they have been threatened. The authority to redact portions of judges' financial disclosure statements expired last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The redaction authority bill passed by the Senate last year would have extended the redaction authority without interruption and expanded it to judges' families. It struck the right balance by preserving congressional oversight to prevent the misuse of this redaction authority, which has been a matter of some concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was disappointed that the House of Representatives failed to act on this legislation that passed the Senate last November but I am pleased that the new House of Representatives was able to pass it earlier this year. I continue to support an extension of redaction authority for threatened judges and am glad that the Senate is passing that measure, <bill type="h" number="1130">H.R. 1130</bill> today. I trust that the President will sign it into law without delay.</paragraph>
