  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends need some time to reflect on the children's health program; not over the course of the 2 weeks just for pressure, but to get their facts straight, to stop getting their information from the White House talking points and get information from the American people, their Governor, about how the program actually works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush is worried that it won't go to poor children because some families earning up to $83,000 a year will be eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, this is not a program for poor children, most of whom are already eligible for Medicaid. It is for children of working families, 90 percent of whom earn less than $40,000 a year. No one gets $83,000, because the Bush administration turned down one State's request. A few do have higher incomes because the States requested it and the Bush administration approved it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration, if they don't like families getting it, can stop approving those waivers.</paragraph>
