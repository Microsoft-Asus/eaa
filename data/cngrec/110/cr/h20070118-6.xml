  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to increasing U.S. troop strength in Iraq. As one Member of Congress who voted in support of the Iraq resolution in 2002, I recognize the pretext for going to war was based on faulty, misleading intelligence. I can not reverse that vote, but I can no longer acquiesce to a failed and tragic military exercise in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two months ago, Generals Casey and Abizaid stated they did not support increasing U.S. troop levels in Iraq. Last month, President Bush maintained that military policy with regard to Iraq would be determined by our military leaders. However, last week President Bush ignored his top military advisors and called for a 20,000-plus increase in U.S. troops to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, along with others, have been pressing the administration to level with the American people on the status of the American security forces being trained and ready to defend their nation. If Iraqis are trained and ready as we are told, we should begin a planned phased withdrawal of U.S. forces; if not, the administration should tell us when they will be trained and ready.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sending more troops to Iraq does nothing to enhance the Iraqis' training; it only places more U.S. forces into harm's way to become additional targets for the insurgency. This failed policy must be stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can support our troops in the field and oppose the escalation of U.S. forces. I urge all my colleagues to work in opposition to the President's increase in U.S. forces.</paragraph>
