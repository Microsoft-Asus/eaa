    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the longest serving current elected official in southern Nevada, Boulder City, NV--Mayor Robert Stanley "Bob" Ferraro. Later this spring, Bob will retire after 31 years of dedicated public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For three decades, Bob has been a civic leader, kind neighbor, and levelheaded voice in the politically active and dynamic community he has called home since 1970. For 17 years, Bob served on the Boulder City Council. Later, he was elevated to serve the city as its mayor. In 1999, he became the first mayor directly elected by the people of Boulder City. During each campaign, he proudly knocked on every door in town--a feat he accomplished seven times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in public service, Bob has presided over Boulder City in an era of unprecedented growth, expanding from 7,800 residents in 1976 to more than 15,000 today. The community Bob calls home is one of those unique places in America that has managed to maintain its distinctive identity in the face of massive change. Throughout the last three decades of unparalleled growth in southern Nevada, Bob Ferraro has stood alongside Boulder City residents to fiercely defend limited growth policies  that have preserved this special place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located just 20 miles from Las Vegas, Boulder City was built by the Bureau of Reclamation during the Great Depression as a housing complex for workers building nearby Hoover Dam. While the original residents flocked to Boulder City seeking opportunity, modern times have seen generations of families choosing to reside in this city on the shore of Lake Mead for its superb quality of life, access to outdoor recreation, and sense of community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This sense of community can be attributed, in part, to Bob's hard work. As mayor, Bob encouraged the development of parks and recreation areas throughout Boulder City. These parks affect the lives of all residents, young and old. From youth sports leagues to adult recreational programs, Boulder City's park system has allowed all residents to continue to enjoy the smalltown feel that makes this city unique.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his time serving the Boulder City community, Bob never forgot that he was a part of the community. He is a past President of the Boulder City Rotary Club and was named the 1980 Rotarian of the Year. He also served as president of the Nevada League of Cities in 1985 and was named Nevada Public Official of the Year in 1986.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His leadership, sincerity, and poise will be missed. I am honored to pay tribute to Bob Ferraro as he prepares to complete his distinguished service to Boulder City and Nevada. I wish him and his wife Connie, his three children, and eight grandchildren much happiness for the future. Southern Nevada is truly a better place because of Bob.</paragraph>
