  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="TRIBUTE TO JIM BILLINGTON">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate Jim Billington on two decades of service as Librarian of Congress. For 20 years, he has presided over this prestigious institution that serves Congress so well but is truly America's national library. It houses documents and artifacts that date to the earliest days of our democracy and, at the same time, manages the U.S. Copyright Office that maintains an ongoing record of America's creative heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Billington had a brilliant career in the academic world before beginning his responsibilities at the Library of Congress. He was highly respected at Harvard, at Princeton and, immediately before becoming Librarian of Congress, as director of the Woodrow Wilson Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Jim Billington has brought a dynamic integrity to the scholarly world. Under his leadership, the Library of Congress was not a dormant collection of books and artifacts. He undertook a new initiative to digitize its collections and make them more accessible and more permanent. He also established the Madison Council to bring outside support and wise counsel to the Library, and created a center for advanced scholars in the humanities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His tenure as Librarian is noteworthy for his many achievements and innovations, his dedication to the historic role of the Library and its unique relationship to Congress, and, most importantly, his extraordinary vision of what the Library could become. Through his work, Jim has made unparalleled contributions to enhance the role that American culture plays in our national life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this special anniversary, I commend him for all that he has accomplished. I am especially grateful for the support and wise counsel he has given to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. As Librarian of Congress, he has served as a member of the board of trustees for the center for two decades, and has been a source of consistent leadership and guidance throughout that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us in Congress owe Jim Billington an immense debt of gratitude for his outstanding public service, and we look forward to many more years of his leadership. On this 20th anniversary of his becoming Librarian of Congress, I join my colleagues in extending my warmest congratulations and deepest appreciation for his achievements.</paragraph>
