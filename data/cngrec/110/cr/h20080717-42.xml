  <narrative>AFFORDABLE ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6712]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, we addressed an enormously important issue, and that is how to give relief to the American people on these soaring energy prices, small businesses, teachers and bus drivers, families who are carpooling, others who are trying to get to work. We owe them our collective minds to be able to ensure that we have a combined philosophy and program as it addresses the question of affordable energy and protecting our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I do believe there is a right way of drilling. I do believe we should go into the National Petroleum Reserve, and frankly I believe we should release gallons of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so the American people can have immediate relief. I also think it is extremely important that we conserve, and we look at solar and wind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as it relates to the 23 million leases that are there, only 3 million are used, let us delegate from those who may own them, let us set aside some opportunity for minority and women-owned businesses and small businesses to be able to engage in that. Let's have a collective effort.</paragraph>
