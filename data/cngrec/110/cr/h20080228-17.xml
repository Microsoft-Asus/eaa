    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="s" number="2272">S. 2272</bill>, which names the postal facility in the town of Southpark Station in Alexandria, Louisiana, as the John "Marty" Thiels Southpark Station in honor and memory of Thiels, a Louisiana postal worker who was killed in the line of duty on October 4, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2272">S. 2272</bill>, which was introduced on October 31, 2007, in the Senate by Senator David Vitter of Louisiana and passed by the Chamber under unanimous consent on November 16, 2007, has been considered and reported out of the Oversight Committee by voice vote as of January 29, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2272">S. 2272</bill> comes to us today from our friends from the State of Louisiana as a way of acknowledging and honoring the work of one of the postal service's own, John Thiels. Affectionately referred to as Marty, Mr. Thiels spent a significant portion of his professional career working for the United States Postal Service. In fact, Thiels served as a letter carrier for nearly 30 years, and 24 years out of those 30 he spent delivering mail to the downtown section of Alexandria, Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A devout husband and a loving father of four, Mr. Thiels' life was cut dramatically short when on October 4, 2007, a distraught 64-year-old gunman went on a shooting rampage near the Rapides Parish Courthouse in Alexandria, Louisiana, wounding three and killing two, one of whom was John Thiels, and the other was Camille Giordano, II, a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An obvious and heartbreaking misfortune, Mr. Thiels lost his life while doing something that he had done so diligently for so many years, delivering mail. John Marty Thiels will long be remembered by many in the Alexandria, Louisiana, area for his years of service and his virtuous reputation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let us pay tribute to the life of this gentleman by passing <bill type="s" number="2272">S. 2272</bill> and renaming the Southpark Post Office Station in Alexandria, Louisiana, as the John "Marty" Thiels Southpark Station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my fellow Members of Congress in lamenting the senseless murder of 50-year-old Alexandria, Louisiana, letter carrier, John Marty Thiels, on Thursday, October 4, 2007. Mr. Thiels was a 30-year veteran of the Alexandria post office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 20 years of that time, he faithfully carried mail on the same route in downtown Alexandria and became well known in the community. On the fateful day of Mr. Thiels' death, a local deranged man went on a shooting spree, eventually taking the lives of five people, including Mr. Thiels, before police were able to take control of the situation. When Mr. Thiels' life was taken, he was simply going about his daily routine of delivering mail to a local law office in Alexandria, Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This terrible event goes to demonstrate that public servants are not immune from harm. On the contrary, many of them brave unforeseen dangers every single day, including innocent letter carriers such as Mr. Thiels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The death of Mr. Thiels was a senseless and heartbreaking tragedy for both his family and the community that he served so well for over three decades. Mr. Thiels' family and his community deserve our deepest sympathy and condolences for their loss. The naming of this post office is a fitting tribute to Mr. Thiels and his dedicated service to the postal service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
