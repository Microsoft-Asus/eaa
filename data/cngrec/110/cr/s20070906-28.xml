    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD my letter to Senator BYRD regarding my absence for rollcall vote No. 315.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. SENATE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, September 6, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. President, due to my presence at a critically important Armed Services Committee hearing regarding the Iraq war, I was unavoidably absent during rollcall vote No. 315. This vote concerned Senator Brown's amendment No. 2673 to the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill. I was questioning committee witnesses at the time the floor vote was called, and I abbreviated my questioning in order to arrive for the vote. However, I arrived on the floor shortly  after the vote concluded. Had I been present, I would have supported Senator Brown's amendment, which I cosponsored. That amendment prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs from outsourcing certain VA jobs to private contractors.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Jim Webb,</narrative>
