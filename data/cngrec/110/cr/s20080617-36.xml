  <narrative><bill type="s" number="3144">S. 3144</bill>. A bill to amend part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act to delay and reform the Medicare competitive acquisition program for purchase of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies; to the Committee on Finance.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I introduce, with my friend Senator Grassley and twenty-four other Democratic and Republican Senators, the Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Reform Act of 2008. In doing so, I would also like to recognize the efforts of Congressman Pete Stark, Congressman Dave Camp, and so many others in the House of Representatives who worked very hard on this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will delay the durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies competitive acquisition program. Many Members of Congress and I have received reports about potential inaccuracies in the implementation of the CAP program. These reports range from suppliers who believe they were wrongly disqualified to questions about the clarity and consistency of information that suppliers received during the bidding process. Some providers were awarded contracts to serve areas  in which they did not previously have a presence. Other suppliers were awarded contracts for service lines with which they have little or no experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support the concept of competitive bidding as a way to decrease costs, it is the obligation of Congress to make sure that these savings are not at the expense of beneficiary access to the care that they need in their own communities. I believe that Congress should take a closer look to make sure this program lives up to its potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to ensure that we are getting the best possible price and quality for beneficiaries, it is critical that the competitive bidding process be accurate and inclusive. I am most concerned about the impact that a poorly designed program will have on Medicare beneficiaries, many of whom are confused about what this new program means for them and are concerned that they won't be able to get care from someone in their own community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This means we must have as many bidders as possible who offer not only the best price but clearly meet high quality standards. Based upon the numbers we have seen as a result of bidding in phase one, I think we need to look more closely to make sure that we are not missing an opportunity to consider additional suppliers who have experience furnishing these services in the communities at play. Furthermore, we need to examine the bidding process outcomes to make sure that the suppliers being offered  contracts to serve patients in a selected area have the team on the ground to help patients in those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also heard concerns that some of the products included in the first phase of the competitive acquisition program may not be the best fit for this type of program because they require specialized handling or expertise. At the end of the day, the most important goal of the Medicare program is to make sure patients get the care that is appropriate for them, so we must tread carefully when we move ahead with a program covering these products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services put forth an admirable effort to implement a complex competitive bidding program in a short time frame. I think that many of the concerns that people have raised about the program can be resolved, but we cannot afford to ignore them. The beneficiary services at stake are just too important to move hastily; no matter how much money we believe we can save.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that it is worth it for us to delay for just a bit and take a closer look to make sure this program lives up to its potential. With a few minor tweaks here and there, I am convinced that the competitive acquisition program will live up to its promise to provide cost effective, high-quality services and products to patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Reform Act of 2008 with my colleague, Senator Baucus, to delay and reform the competitive bidding program for Medicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. We are introducing this legislation to address serious concerns that have arisen over implementation of the competitive bidding program which is set to take effect in certain areas of the country on July 1,  2008. The bill will delay the start of the competitive bidding program for 18 months and require the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to review the program and address significant issues that have been raised regarding implementation of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must act now before the competitive bidding program takes effect. We must ensure that the frail elderly who depend on diabetic supplies, oxygen, and other medical equipment for life-threatening conditions will continue to have access to essential medical products and supplies which are vital to their daily lives. The continued viability of much of the home medical supply industry is in serious jeopardy as a result of flaws that surfaced in the program during the first round of competitive  bidding. Many small home medical equipment suppliers are in danger of going out of business through no fault of their own if the competitive bidding program is implemented as planned. Losing a significant number of small suppliers from the home medical equipment industry would have severe, unintended adverse consequences on thousands of beneficiaries who need home medical</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These concerns are especially problematic right now in states such as Iowa in the Midwest which are already reeling from the disastrous floods and tornadoes we have experienced this past month. The loss of many more small businesses would be disastrous to beneficiaries whose access to needed medical supplies has already been severely limited, let alone the ripple effect this would inflict on local economies which have already been severely impacted by record floods which have harmed scores of  businesses and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard from many medical equipment suppliers that the rules of the competitive bidding program were unclear or were changed at the last minute, and that their bids were not considered. CMS has told us that roughly two-thirds of the bids submitted by suppliers were ultimately rejected for lack of proper documentation or other issues apart from price. This was done even though CMS had assured suppliers when the program began that they would be notified if their bids lacked the required documentation.  Two weeks before the bidding closed, CMS abruptly decided they would not provide such notification. Appropriately, this bill terminates the contracts that were awarded under Round One and pays any applicable damages incurred as a result of the terminations, if any. In the future, the bill requires</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am committed to ensuring that Medicare dollars are spent wisely and provide high quality products to seniors at the lowest possible cost. The program improvements required by this legislation will ensure more protections for beneficiaries and lead to lower prices and higher quality medical products while ensuring that beneficiaries will still have access to the medical equipment and supplies that they need. These improvements will also help  prevent many small home medical equipment suppliers from going out of business due to a flawed bidding process which unfairly eliminated them from the Medicare program for three years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our bill, the cost of delaying the competitive bidding program and adding additional safeguards to the program would be fully paid for by the durable medical equipment industry. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the delay in implementing competitive bidding and the reforms to the program included in this bill will increase Medicare spending by $3.1 billion over 5 years. To offset the cost of the legislation, in 2009 those DME items subject to Round One of the program will not receive  a CPI update, and payments for those items will be reduced by 9.5 percent. Items not subject to Round One will receive a CPI update in 2009, and all DME items will receive CPI updates in years 2010 through 2013. In 2014, those DME items which were subject to the 9.5 percent payment reduction in 2009 will receive an additional payment increase of two percent over the CPI unless they are covered by competitive bidding contracts then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As is true in many sectors, the DME industry is given a bad name by a few bad apples that spoil the barrel. Unfortunately, we hear on a regular basis from the Office of Inspector General and the Justice Department that the DME industry continues to have far too many incidents of waste, fraud and abuse. The multi-agency Medicare Fraud Task Force formed last year has uncovered numerous examples of criminal behavior and successfully prosecuted dozens of fraudulent or non-existent DME suppliers in  South Florida and elsewhere. In just over a year, the task force has brought more than 120 cases against nearly 200 defendants in South Florida alone who have been charged with a total of $638 million in fraud. We must have stronger safeguards to ensure that companies who participate in competitive bidding are actual, legitimate companies that can provide</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes standards which will lead to an improved competitive bidding program. Under the bill, all DME suppliers must be accredited and meet quality standards by October 2009. We also close a loophole that currently allows subcontractors to remain unaccredited. We heard many complaints about companies awarded contracts who had no presence in the competitively bid area and who then began to solicit subcontractors to assist in carrying out the terms of the contract they had been  awarded. Under the current program, subcontractors do not need to meet accreditation standards. Our bill requires that every company that supplies DME in the Medicare program must meet accreditation standards, whether they are primary suppliers or subcontractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to delay the competitive bidding program in order to ensure seniors continued access to needed home medical equipment and supplies and to remedy flaws in the bidding process and make other necessary improvements in the competitive bidding program.</paragraph>
