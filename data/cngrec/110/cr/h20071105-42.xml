    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose the proposed U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My opposition to the Peru FTA reflects America's opposition to the recent string of trade pacts that benefitted the wealthiest few at the expense of hardworking Americans. A recent poll revealed that six in 10 Republicans think free trade has been bad for the U.S., and that's just Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public is tired of waiting for this administration to "get it" and to start negotiating fair and smart trade deals that can benefit the little guy as well as the corporate fat cat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public is impatient and, frankly, so am I. Fair trade can create economic opportunities for everyone, big business and working families alike, at home and abroad. Fair trade can advance our economy without jeopardizing good jobs and encourage development without ravaging our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some say that the Peru FTA is better than what we've had in the past. I join the American people in saying, "It's not good enough."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Join me in standing up for American families. I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the Peru Free Trade Agreement.</paragraph>
