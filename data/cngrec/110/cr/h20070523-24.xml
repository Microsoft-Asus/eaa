    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>) to protect consumers from price-gouging of gasoline and other fuels, and for other purposes, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, gasoline prices are now at record highs. The average price of gas is $3.19 nationwide, with my home State of Illinois having higher prices than any other at $3.46 a gallon. Now, rising gas prices are one thing, and I fully recognize the reality of global oil markets, the current state of our refinery capacity, and the basic laws of supply and demand. But the gouging of American consumers is another matter entirely, and the bill on the floor, <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>, the Federal Price Gouging Protection  Act, ensures that American consumers are protected from companies that will prey on them during emergencies when they are most vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) for a fine piece of legislation that is both thoughtful and careful in its scope. On the one hand, the bill is tough and decisive. It gives the Federal Trade Commission the tools to crack down on and punish those companies that would price-gouge American consumers by unscrupulously taking advantage of unique energy shortages and unconscionably raising the price of gasoline on the American consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, the bill explicitly takes into account the totality of market forces, both domestic and international. <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill> preserves the ability of companies to mitigate against legitimate risks and raise prices as necessary. Simply put, the bill is carefully written such that if a company is found liable of price gouging under this act, then they are in fact price gouging. It is very difficult to argue that we are overreaching or too vague in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, I fully support Mr. Stupak's bill and its expeditious treatment on the suspension calendar. It is important for the American people to know we are on the ball, and that this ball is moving quickly to address their concerns. I urge Members of the House to pass the legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday in my hometown of Appleton, Wisconsin, the price for a gallon of gas hit  $3.45. Since President Bush assumed office, the price for gas has nearly doubled. Higher prices for gas punish all Americans, punish small businesses, students, senior citizens, farmers, and even our local, State and Federal Governments as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody is asking, why? Why did the price at the pump go up even when the cost per barrel went down? The most likely answer is price gouging somewhere along the supply line, from the oil company to the refinery to the speculators in the options markets who buy and hold the oil for only a nanosecond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People everywhere want answers, and here is what we can do. Today the House will consider the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. And along with Congressman Stupak and Congressman Rush and others, we will put a cop back on the block. What we need is effective and active oversight, not hide-and-seek politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's take this step together in the right direction. This bill defines what price gouging is. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Let's make no mistake about this. The last-minute changes don't improve this legislation. The revisions are simply fig-leaf changes to provide cover for oil patch Democratic Members who are being strong-armed into voting for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter how much you dress this up, this bill is still about price controls. We tried price controls in the 1970s, and they didn't work. It resulted in mass rationing, long lines at the pump, and consumer outrage. History is quite clear on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George Mason University economist Walter Williams has said: "Politicians of both parties have rushed in to exploit public ignorance and emotion. But there's an important downside to these political attacks on producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"What about the next disaster? How much sense does it make for producers to make the extra effort to provide goods and services if they know they risk prosecution for charging what might be seen as `unconscionable prices'?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Williams is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public deserves better. Congress has the responsibility to pass a balanced, comprehensive energy program that uses innovative technology to explore and expand our domestic energy supply, to move us towards energy independence. The last thing we need to do is to turn back the clock to the failed energy policies of the 1970s. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support passage of the Price Gouging Prevention Act, and I commend Congressman Stupak for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In eastern Connecticut, where I come from, the price of gas has reached its highest level in history, $3.26 today, up 31 cents from a month ago, and more than $1 since February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government Accountability Office reported on Tuesday that the increasing gasoline prices have cost consumers an extra $20 billion this year, and we are only in May. That is a tax on consumers. It is a tax on small businesses. It has a ripple effect all throughout our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is not just about driving over Memorial Day weekend. This is about whether or not energy prices are going to cripple the ability of this economy to grow and thrive and prosper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to put accountability into the system. The Stupak bill is not price controls, it is a system to make sure that the price is a fair one and is justifiable according to market conditions. Those are the tools that we are giving to the Federal Trade Commission.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond to that. We are dealing with a world energy market, a world energy market. This bill basically doesn't seem to understand that prices are set on world markets. Clearly what we need to do is understand that aspect of this to craft a meaningful energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why investment in technology to come up with a broad range of alternative energy sources is the appropriate way to approach this. We don't want to go back to the price controls of the 1970s.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, setting new records in the United States is generally associated with achievements and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this week our Nation hit a new record that most consumers are not celebrating. Gasoline prices were reported to reach nationwide averages of $3.20 or higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not hard to understand these prices if you look at the Republican-controlled Congress' Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided billions of dollars to the oil and gas companies while spending only pennies on renewable efforts for fuel that would allow us to get ourselves off the dependency on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans, we do not have a history of shying away from a challenge, and there is no reason to step down from the challenge that is ahead of us because of these Republicans. I think we can do better, and our history as Americans show that we will do better if we have the right leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Price Gouging Protection Act because it fulfills America's promise to do what Americans can do if they put their mind to it, and that is to do better and get off this dependency on foreign oil.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me first say that it is appropriate that the House bring this type of legislation in this Congress before the body because gasoline prices are high, and the American public is concerned about those high prices, so it is not inappropriate to consider legislation of this type. We did it twice in the last Congress, passed an anti-price-gouging bill, once as part of a larger energy package and once as a stand-alone piece of legislation. So there is nothing inappropriate about bringing  this before the body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, I think it is fair to say that it is inappropriate, at least in my opinion, to bring it before the body in the way it has been brought. The bill  that is actually before us, I don't know how many Members of the majority saw this bill as it is currently configured, but nobody in the minority saw it until approximately 2:45 p.m. yesterday afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I left the Capitol at approximately 6:15, it had still not been noticed that it was going to be on the suspension calendar this morning. It may have been noticed and I just didn't get that notice, but I was told it was up at 10 a.m. this morning, and now it's 10:45. So those of us in the minority have a certain sense of concern that we've not been contacted. We've not been asked for our input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We've not been allowed to negotiate, participate in any shape, form or fashion. All we've been allowed to do is come onto the floor, in my case at 10:45, and speak on the bill, and at some point in time, I assume there will be a vote on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did study the bill last evening. I have lots of concerns about this bill. I don't know what "unconscionably excessive" means. It's not defined in statute. As far as I can tell, it's not been defined in any case law. Apparently, it's going to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also asked my staff to check around, see if there had been price-gouging lawsuits brought in the various States. Over half of the States of our great Union have price-gouging statutes on the books. We're aware of one State, in the State of Kentucky, the Kentucky Attorney General has either filed a suit or prepared to file a lawsuit in Kentucky. There may be others, but that's the only one that I know of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's certainly no systemic outbreak of price-gouging lawsuits being filed around the country, and if we really had pandemic price gouging going on, I think the States that have price-gouging statutes would be using their State statues. They're not doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is that? Well, again, I'm not a trained economist, but it seems to me that what we have is a case of the chickens coming home to roost. We have not done much, if any, on the supply side for our oil situation in this country in the last 30 years; haven't built a refinery, brand new, from scratch, in almost 35 years. We've put almost every place that has any potential for new oil development off-limits. Can't drill up in ANWR, Alaska; can't drill off the coast of California; can't drill off  the coast of Florida; can't drill off the coast of South Carolina, North Carolina; can't drill off a lot of portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And funny things happen. As we've kind of sat on our supply haunches and not done anything, demand worldwide and domestically has gone up, and as demand goes up, if you don't have some ability to increase the supply, sooner or later that price is going to go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I wasn't here to hear Mr. Stupak's opening statement, and he may not have said this, but he said yesterday in the oversight hearing the price of crude oil has dipped slightly. He doesn't understand why the price of gasoline has gone up. And all you have to do is look at the housing market in northern Virginia to get the answer to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had supper last evening with my son who is working at the Department of Energy. They are living in a home that's probably 35 years old. I don't know what that home cost brand new when it was built, but a good guess would be $30-, $40,000. That price at the time was based on the cost of construction, the cost of the land, fair profit for the builder and real estate agent. So you could say the cost of that property was $30- or $40,000. Well, the people that own the home have just sold it. It  wouldn't be appropriate to tell the exact selling price. My son is renting it, but it's over $700,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, is that price gouging? No. It's what the market demand for housing in northern Virginia is. It's not related to the cost of the property, it's related to the demand for housing in northern Virginia. So those folks have made a nice profit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the same thing in the oil industry. Demand for oil is going up in China, demand for oil is going up in Europe, demand for oil is going up in Asia, demand for oil is going up in the United States, and if you don't have more of it, price is going to go up. Is that price gouging? No. It is what the market requires to balance limited supply with increasing demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of gasoline in the United States 3 years ago doubled. Demand actually increased 1 percent. Now, eventually, last time prices got to about $3 a gallon demand did dip slightly, supply increased a little bit, price went back down. Right before the last election, the price in Texas for gasoline got down to about $1.90 a gallon. Since my friends on the other side have won the election and taken over, the price has gone back up to what we see today. Is it their fault? It is not their fault  right now. It's not Bobby Rush's fault, it's not Bart Stupak's fault, it's not John Dingell's fault. It's not Ed Markey's fault over there in the corner. Although I'm tempted to blame Mr. Markey, but it wouldn't be fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Demand has gone up and supply has not gone up and the price has gone up, and it's going to keep going up until we do something, both on the demand side and the supply side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, is this the worst bill that's ever been on the floor of the House of Representatives? No, it's not. Is it the best bill that's ever been on the floor? No, it's not. You know, I think it is a flawed bill. The definitions are not there. The mitigating factors are not there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would be well-served, since it's on the Suspension Calendar, to defeat it, get 140, 150 votes, then go back to committee, have some hearings, try to develop a little bipartisanship, bring a different bill to the floor, and probably pass with an overwhelming margin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm going to vote against this bill, and I'm going to ask that all my colleagues take a serious look at it, vote against it, so we can figure out the right thing to do. And the next time we bring an energy package, don't just bring something that's symbolic to the floor. Let's bring a bill that helps build new refineries. Let's bring a bill that actually increases the supply. Yes, let's bring a bill that might do something to limit demand. I think the time has come to look at some of those  bills seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's bring a package that actually might do something, other than rhetorical, to bring gasoline prices in the United States back down to levels that we think are more appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't like to pay 3 dollars or more for gas anymore than our constituents do, but this legislation won't do a single thing to keep market prices down or address the reasons gas prices are rising. What it will do is threaten legitimate businesses with huge fines and hard-working people with long jail terms. Furthermore, the bill could quite possibly lead to price controls and 1970s-style gas lines. I oppose the legislation before us today for substantive reasons, as well as based on the process--or  lack of process--that has brought this bill to the Floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, Mr. Speaker, I want the American public to understand how the legislative process has broken down in this case. In light of your unprecedented intent to remove the minority's right to a motion to recommit, it should not surprise anyone in this chamber that the bill before us has bypassed the Committee of jurisdiction--The Energy and Commerce Committee--to come straight to the House Floor. The Committee did not hold a legislative hearing. The Committee did not hold a mark up. The only opportunity  my Committee Members had to seek input from the Federal regulators with expertise on legislation was yesterday afternoon during an oversight hearing--a hearing in which the Democratic majority did not even have a witness testify who represents the independent gas stations. It's really too bad their voice was not heard, because the little Mom-and-Pop gas store owner who sells 60 percent of the gas in the U.S. could go to jail for up to 10 years under this bill if they price their gas wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of my concern for the absence of certain witnesses at our oversight hearing, a new version of this bill was circulated only yesterday afternoon. That's right: we have had less than 24 hours to review the changes, but we are supposed to vote on it. Mr. Speaker, I thought things were going to be fair in this Congress, but I seem to have been mistaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration has issued a Statement of Administration Policy Against this bill. It indicates that it will lead to gas shortages and do nothing to help consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the substance of this legislation, I have serious concerns that this won't have the intended effect. The Federal Trade Commission is the expert on competition policy and has conducted several studies and investigations of the oil and gas markets markets. In its most recent investigation, the FTC studied each  segment of the industry after Hurricane Katrina. Guess what they found? No evidence of price manipulation at the refining level. To the contrary,  they found a competitive market. Transportation sector? No evidence of manipulation. Inventory levels? Again, no evidence of manipulation. Gasoline futures?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You guessed it, Mr. Speaker, no evidence of manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the FTC found was a competitive market that responded to the Katrina crisis by changing their priorities and shipping products to the areas that needed it. The FTC has studied the issue repeatedly, and has not found any evidence of price increases that were not a result of a change in market conditions or other factors that may affect the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It may surprise Members that the FTC is opposed to a Federal price gouging law. Why? Because they're concerned that it could do more harm to consumers than good. The Secretary of the Department of Energy opposes it, as well as the National Association of Convenience Stores, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Independent Gas Marketers of America, the American Petroleum Institute, and just about every economist who knows that price controls harm consumers when they cause shortages. What  is better, higher-priced gas, or no gas at all?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the sponsor of this bill that people who take unfair advantage of others should be punished. But we already have laws on the books to address those issues at the Federal and state level. Now we are going to add a Federal standard to the patchwork of state laws for gouging--a term which has no legal or economic meaning. I believe it is unnecessary and fear it will return us to the 1970s gas shortages. No retailer will want to supply the market at a higher price and risk  being fined millions and going to jail for years. And what wholesaler will risk $150 million in fines and possible jail time if they raise their price more than a competitor?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know many here would like to go home to their constituents over Memorial Day recess with a gas price gouging bill rather than address substantive Federal Energy Policy that might actually address the factors causing gasoline prices to rise. Republicans were able to pass many energy-related bills when we were in the Majority, though Democrats in the House and Senate voted against almost every piece of legislation that would have increased our domestic energy supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can understand a visitor to California might suspect they are being gouged at the pump when they fill up in San Francisco for upwards of $4 a gallon, but that is just a result of the Federal, State and Local taxes and other state fuel requirements. If something is broken, Mr. Speaker, it is not the free market. This Congress must act to increase domestic supply of gasoline, not enact feel-good legislation that is ill-conceived and ineffective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my friend from Texas that he should take a closer look at the bill. The bill explicitly takes into account market conditions, both domestic and international. The bill has two pages of mitigating factors. If the costs go up, and they are going up, this bill allows companies to capture the costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would have to just conclude, Mr. Speaker, that my friend from Texas needs to take a closer look at this bill because his arguments are just not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Rush for yielding me time. I'd like to respond to the gentleman from Texas and some of the claims he made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, Democrats have only been in the majority for 4 months, and we are looking for ways to end this pain that motorists are feeling every day when they fill up their car at the gas pump, and that is, to bring forth the price-gouging legislation you see before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Barton says we should not pass this for this reason or that reason. These are just excuses. He complains about the process. With all due respect, we learned the process from Mr. Barton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, they brought forth a gas price bill, was introduced on Tuesday, May 2, 2006. Wednesday, May 3, 2006, we voted on it. We never saw it. This bill has been around for over a year. So let's stop the excuses. American people don't want arguments about what process. They want relief at the pump, and that's what we're doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lookit, today Members of the House have a very simple choice. Vote to stand up with consumers, your constituents, who are paying record gasoline prices, nationwide average, record prices, or vote to protect big oil companies' enormous profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>, which has over 120 bipartisan cosponsors, would give the Federal Trade Commission the explicit authority to investigate and punish those who artificially inflate the price of energy. The bill would provide a clear, enforceable definition of price gouging; focus enforcement on the worst offenders, especially companies that sell more than a half billion dollars a year of gasoline. We strengthen penalties, both criminal and civil, with up to triple damage for those who would  price-gouge us; and direct the penalties collected to go into the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must pass without any more excuses this legislation. Today's legislation is truly a first step in addressing the outrageous prices we're seeing at the gas pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We'll be working to protect consumers from high natural gas prices. We've introduced the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices legislation to improve the oversight of energy trading in this country, and I hope we can move this legislation later this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the House of Representatives actually voted on a weaker bill, on May 3 as I indicated, brought forth by Republicans on price gouging. We passed that bill under suspension, like we are today, 389-34. The Senate didn't do anything with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to announce that since the Democrats are in charge, the Senate bill, very similar to my bill, has already made it out of committee, and we expect a vote on it next month. So we can actually bring relief to consumers now that the Democrats are in charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, every Member has a choice. Side with big oil or side with the consumers who are being ripped off at the gas pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank Speaker Pelosi for her work and leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor, also Chairman Dingell of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, and his staff for their help in putting forth a very fine piece of legislation that is much broader in scope than what we voted on last year, has stronger penalties and will truly give the American people relief at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before Members leave for the Memorial Day recess, vote to provide your constituents with some relief at the gas pump. Vote for <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I rise in opposition to this legislation, but I compliment my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak). He has, in fact, worked diligently on this issue, and I join him in my concern about prices that are charged to the American people. Indeed, he just indicated he would very much like to see relief at the pump, and so would I. I happen to drive a Ford F-250, which does not get good gas mileage, and I, along  with others, would like to see relief at the pump. I certainly commend all those who are cosponsors of this legislation as having good intentions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern, however, is that it will not achieve that result. The reality is we do have very high gas prices, and we have prices that have gone up dramatically in just the recent few months. We all want to know the answer for that, and I've spent some time trying to look at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I don't see evidence that there is price gouging and that high gas prices are a result of price gouging. What I see is that they are the result of policies of this government, and it seems to me that we ought to be looking at the policies of this government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, we as a Nation, this Congress, have imposed a tariff on imported ethanol. We could bring in ethanol produced in other countries at a dramatically lower price than the ethanol we're producing in this country today, but instead, we tax that ethanol and make it even higher priced. Last year, when the prices went up, I voted  against price-gouging legislation, but I dropped my own bill to suspend that tariff so that we could take advantage of  lower-priced ethanol. Unfortunately, the Congress didn't move in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago, I went to the commodities market in New York, and they told me the problem with gasoline prices is refineries. We do have a lack of refineries in this country, and I've dropped legislation to encourage the construction of more refineries. I think there is concern that the refinery industry is holding the capacity of those refineries right at the edge so the prices can be the highest possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one of the issues you hear is that part of the reason gasoline prices are so high right now is because of the conversion from winter gas to summer gas. That conversion is compelled by government regulations which drive up the cost and by government regulations which spell out precisely how it must be done and that they must draw down supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me, before we start tampering with the free market, which has served us so well, and before we start passing very wide ranging legislation of this type, we have to make a decision. Do we want the government to regulate prices? Do we want a huge new bureaucracy in there looking at a poor mom-and-pop gas station to see if they raise prices? Or do we want to look at the policies of this government which have held down supply and which have not met demand?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me this is simple and straightforward. I understand the urge to do it, but the problem is, if we empower a massive new government bureaucracy, we will not get relief at the pump which Mr. Stupak wants and which I'd like to see. We will indeed just create a large bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In my home State of Arizona, we have tried this. We have had attorney general after attorney general, even in my tenure, when I was in the attorney general's office, we investigated price gouging and could not find evidence of it. Let's look at the market forces that are causing these high prices. I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Illinois, and for his leadership on this bill, and the gentleman from Michigan. The bill before us today would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish wholesale or retail sale of gasoline or other petroleum distillates at prices that are unconscionably excessive or take unfair advantage of consumers during any presidentially declared national or regional energy emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we hear from the Republicans, don't interfere in the free market. Don't touch the free market. Don't have the Federal Government getting in on the side of the consumers. It's just a matter of supply and demand. That's what the Republicans are arguing. Don't interfere with the free market, even if it goes up to $3.20 a gallon for gasoline, $3.80 a gallon for gasoline, $4 a gallon for gasoline. Don't let the Federal Government help out the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know what? The Republicans are right. It is a matter of supply and demand. Consumers are forced to supply whatever money the oil companies demand from the consumers. The oil companies have the consumer over a barrel, a barrel of oil that the oil companies control and that they price. They price it wherever they want to put it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They tip the consumer upside down, the oil companies do, and they shake money out of the pockets of consumers at the pump. The Christians had a better chance against the lions than the consumer has against the oil companies at the pumps in the United States today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All we are saying is let's give the Federal Government a sword to get into the battle in the arena on behalf of the consumers in America. And the Republicans are saying, we don't want to arm the Federal Trade Commission so they can help the consumers so that they are not tipped upside down. It is clear that high gas prices are hitting families hard, but they are also causing our economy to stall and to sputter like a jalopy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today addresses one potential cause of high prices: price gouging by the oil companies. It sends a signal to oil companies that there will now be a regulator out there that has been empowered to take action when unconscionably high prices are being charged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The free market, I don't think so. I think that when we look at this oil market, we understand that the consumer is at the whim of the oil companies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in opposition to this legislation, because I certainly feel that it is going to increase the cost of gasoline to the American people. <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill> does purport to crack down on price gouging and marketplace manipulation by integrated large oil companies. Yet that is not what this legislation is going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a hearing in committee about it yesterday, and I wish, indeed, that we were going to have the bill before us for a markup. What I find in this piece of legislation is that it will put a target on the back of every small business owner who runs and operates a neighborhood convenience store, a filling station or a truck stop. As I said in our hearing yesterday, there are so many of these that are the local gathering spot. These are not people that are going to gouge their neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, I know it is tempting to react to constituents' frustration with high gas prices. We are all frustrated with that. But the way to do it is not passing a hastily drafted price-control legislation. We should be focused on the real problem and work for real results on this issue. That is what our constituents want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill> is not going to give us the real results. What we are going to see is a turn-back to energy policy, back to the Jimmy Carter era. It is a clumsy attempt, I think, to punish bad actors who take advantage of the public. But the bill adopts some vague language, employs some heavy-handed criminal penalties, some unenforceable civil penalties that no small business owner could afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do think it's a little bit of legislative overkill, and some people would call it unconscionably excessive. They are entitled to that point. It was my hope that Congress would go through regular order, would address some of the issues pertaining to this Nation's energy policy, and look for some real solutions to the root problem.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that's important to keep in mind is why are gasoline prices what they are, and it is not the retailer. When we look at what has happened to prices over all, let's keep in mind that we have become more and more dependent upon other nations. When we look at what's contributed to costs, look at this: Crude oil costs are 56 percent of the price; taxes are 18 percent of the price; refining nearly 17 percent of the price; distribution and marketing, nearly 9 percent of the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has happened with regard to crude oil prices, they have doubled since 2004, they have tripled since 2001, and they have gone up over 600 percent since the 1980s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what has happened, as the cost of a barrel of oil has gone from $11 a barrel to over $70 a barrel, is Congress has continually stood in the way of trying to come up with more sources. We have abundant supplies. We have the Atlantic coast, the gulf coast, the Pacific coast, the western States and Alaska. Whenever those come up for a vote, Congress shuts it down. Over 90 percent  of Federal lands are off-limits to exploring for the vast supplies of  oil we have there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have shut off some of our other sources, and some are still trying to do that with regard to using coal as another energy source. We have not funded fully the things we need to do for hydrogen fuel cell. We have not gone far enough with conservation, with our automobiles, with reducing homeowner uses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So between these issues of exploration, conservation, diversification, we have not taken the steps we need to do to truly reduce energy costs. It concerns me greatly that we are moving forward to blaming the retailer when we ought to be looking to blame ourselves. After all, if we have supplies of oil in the gulf coast, which we set off-limits to ourselves, and, yet, we let Cuba explore for them, something is terribly wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that what this Congress does is work more towards energy independence and recognize that it's changing the way we explore for oil and making sure that we do much more for diversification of our sources and conserving our huge energy waste in this country. That is what is going to lower the prices of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until we make this commitment as a Nation, and until we make this commitment as a Congress, we will not see these prices go down.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for the time and thank you for the opportunity to speak to this very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the rising cost of gasoline is causing huge problems for families throughout south Florida, which I represent, and certainly throughout the whole country. In south Florida a gallon of gasoline is well over $3.25 and rising. In fact, there is gas even at $3.59 per gallon in my local area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the excuse this time? Is it disruptions of oil in the Middle East? Not that I am aware of. I haven't heard. Hurricane damage to refineries? No, again. How about the summer driving season? Seems to me this is May. So, again, no excuses, no excuses, but we just hear more and more excuses from oil companies that it's the drivers, it's this or that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, there are a lot of answers here, but let's focus on where the market manipulation is going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my area, tourism drives the economy. When gas prices go up, the first thing families do is they stay within their budget and cut back on their vacations, vacations that many times are planned to Florida. When gas prices go up, families and businesses feel it, and it negatively impacts every part of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I am here today to show my strong support for the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. This bill, authored by my friend Mr. Stupak and others, would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to crack down on the people who price gouge. This bill is an excellent step in the short term because it protects consumers and gives the government the teeth it needs to go after market manipulators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the long term, we are only going to solve this problem by moving towards energy independence. American families can no longer afford to rely exclusively on oil for their energy needs. We all know that investing in alternative fuel sources is vital to our national security and to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being energy-independent is a goal that many of us have been talking about and working on for many years. That goal has never been more important than it is right now. But today is the time we need to make changes that will reduce gas prices for American consumers now, and in the future let's work towards energy independence.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have grave concerns about the bill before us today, specifically the lack of clarity in defining "unconscionable." I believe this term to be ambiguous, and, in fact, could lead to severe supply shortages in times of national emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this proposal, a gasoline station owner could receive civil and criminal penalties totaling $5 million and 10 years in prison for charging "unconscionable" prices. Yet there is no clear definition for what is unconscionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To add insult to injury, if a station owner were to charge less than the market price, he could also be subject to charges of undercutting the market. Were I a gasoline station owner in a time of crisis, I likely would shut down my pumps and sell Snickers bars and Coca-Colas and try to make money that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not defending those who would charge unfairly. I firmly believe, and, in fact, in my home State of Texas, we have a strong antigouging price statute already on the books. If it is determined that illegal pricing has occurred, the individuals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's be sure we do not create a climate which causes business owners to stop selling gasoline at a time in crisis when we so clearly will need those resources.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday we had a hearing on gas price gouging, and the Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission actually came and testified. On page 12 of his testimony, footnote number 24, I would like to quote the following: The statute mandating post-Katrina price investigation effectively defined price gouging as an average price of gasoline available for sale to the public that exceeded its average price in the area for the month before the event, unless the increase was substantially  attributable to additional costs in connection with production, transportation, delivery and sale of gasoline in that area, or to national or international markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When questioned yesterday, Commissioner Kovacic said, We've used it. We have the definition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation makes it clear to take these factors into consideration when you determine whether price gouging is going on: How much did it cost delivered at transportation? What was the bill of sale from the supplier. These are factors in the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FTC clearly understands it. Members of the House should be able to understand it. Vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his hard work on these issues, and I also appreciate my colleagues from the committee. But I am here to say to my friends that, as we look at this bill, I don't know what this bill does because the bill is so unclear. It didn't go through our committee. Like the other legislation we passed in this Congress, it is not likely to become law. I believe we have put around 21 bills on the President's desk so far this year, a dozen of them to name  post offices. And the reason for that is all of the bills we passed in the House don't create a result, they don't create law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just refer to one thing. It says you can't sell fuel in an emergency situation at a price that is, (a), "unconscionably excessive." Of course you shouldn't do that. We shouldn't allow that. But we should define what that means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the supporters of the bill has told me, well, every court will decide what that means. I have got to tell you, the mom-and-pop grocery and gasoline station owner can't wonder what every court is going to decide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is unclear. It needs work. It puts an undue hardship on people that are trying to make a living running a  service station, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that the American people are suffering right now, and they are demanding this Congress to take action right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can never be a more perfect time for this Congress to take action. Now is the time to take action. Now is the time, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to just inform my colleagues that scare tactics will not work this time. If they will look at this bill, they will see that scare tactics are nowhere in this bill. This bill is a scalpel, it is not a meat axe. This bill carefully speaks to the issues that the American people face. This bill is carefully crafted to take into account market conditions, explicitly listing those mitigating factors that will spur the FTC into action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any company that gouges should be sought out, should be identified, should be brought before justice, should be brought before the American people in the form of the Federal Trade Commission. A company will be found guilty of price gouging under this bill only, and I repeat, only if they engage in unconscionable pricing. We do not suspend free markets nor do we suspend the laws of supply and demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, the American consumers need us to act, they want us to act, they demand that we do act. Now is the time. Now is the time for us to act. I ask Members of this Congress to vote in favor of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill> is intended to stop and punish unscrupulous gasoline price gougers. The bill empowers the Federal Trade Commission to go after gougers at all levels of the gasoline distribution chain and to impose stiff penalties on violators. It also provides authority for the States to go after retail price gougers under Federal law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is not, however, intended to prohibit all increases in price--only those increases that grossly exceed the supplier's earlier prices and competitors' prices and that do not reflect reasonable responses to an emergency situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would not prohibit a seller from raising prices to compensate for extra risks, such as staying open while a hurricane is bearing down, traveling outside an affected area to secure additional supplies and transport them to people in need, or postponing regular maintenance to increase output during an emergency. These are all efforts that ameliorate a dire situation and the bill is not intended to discourage them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill would permit suppliers to reasonably factor in other local, regional, national, and international market developments in the quickly-changing and uncertain market conditions characteristic of energy emergency situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, Mr. Speaker, this bill is intended to prohibit grossly excessive, pernicious, and predatory increases in the price of gasoline during emergencies--but not to prevent or discourage fair and reasonable responses to unusual market conditions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>, I rise in support of the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act, and urge its passage by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gasoline prices are now at record highs. In my home state of Michigan, the average price of regular gas is $3.47 a gallon--a full 66 cents a gallon higher than it was at this time last year. According to the General Accounting Office, the rise in gasoline prices this year has drained consumers of an extra $20 billion. The six largest oil companies announced $30 billion in profits over the first three months of 2007 alone. This is on top of the $125 billion in profits they racked up last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other side says that we should do nothing. They say that it's a world market for oil, and therefore something we cannot control. How then do they explain that the cost of gasoline has been rising even in the face of falling world oil prices? We must face the fact that there is something wrong in the distribution chain, especially during times of energy emergencies such as when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. As a first step in attacking the problem, we need to give the Federal Trade  Commission the explicit authority to investigate and punish those who artificially inflate the price of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oil companies oppose this bill. The White House also has indicated that the President may veto the bill. With all due resect, we work for our constituents, not the oil companies and not the White House. I urge the House to stand with consumers and vote for this needed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. HARE Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R 1252, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oil prices are continuing to skyrocket, increasing the burden on American families, small businesses, and individuals who rely on their vehicles for their livelihood. Every day I hear from troubled constituents who are paying over $3.00 per gallon at the pump. Constituents like Richard Benefiel, a small business owner who called me yesterday out of desperation explaining he would have to shut down his shipping operation in less than 30 days unless relief was provided. On the other hand, Exxon-Mobil  raked in $9.3 billion between January and March--its best first quarter in history. This is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today is a much needed step toward addressing market manipulation by Big Oil and the egregious impact it has on the American consumer. The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act provides the Federal Trade Commission with new authority to investigate and prosecute energy companies who engage in predatory pricing, market manipulation, and other unfair practices, with an emphasis on those who profit most, thereby providing immediate and much needed relief to consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, this is only the first step in bringing down energy costs. Last year, our Nation hit its highest dependence on foreign oil, importing 771,000 barrels daily from Saudi Arabia and other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. This served as a wake-up call for the United States to begin taking measures to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. I refuse to continue to allow OPEC, which accounts for 65 percent of internationally traded oil, to continue to dictate our Nation's gas  prices. Antitrust laws must be put into action and greedy oil exporters need to be held accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that we voted yesterday to pass <bill type="h" number="2264">H.R. 2264</bill>, which authorizes the Justice Department to take legal action against OPEC state-controlled entities who conspire to limit supply or fix the price of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe that building a diverse energy portfolio which focuses on renewable, homegrown energy sources like ethanol, biodiesel, as well as wind, solar, hydro-power and clean-coal technologies is a critical step toward energy independence, which will bring down prices, and clean up our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act is a critical first step in addressing skyrocketing energy costs and I urge all my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400427" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to price gouging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good news for Florida consumers is that the state of Florida already has the ability to protect consumers from price gouging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Florida law finds that gouging has occurred when a commodity's price represents a "gross disparity" from the average price of that commodity during the 30 days immediately prior to the declared emergency. This applies unless the increase is attributable to additional costs incurred by the seller or to national or international market trends. In fact, Florida law enforcement fully investigated over 58 cases of alleged gouging after Tropical Storm Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violators of Florida's anti-gouging law are subject to civil penalties of $1,000 per violation. In 2005, the State of Florida enacted criminal penalties for those who engage in price gouging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the protections that Florida consumers already have in place through State law enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission has the authority to investigate and bring charges against those that engage in price gouging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a significant departure from previous legislation addressing this issue, Floridians who are gouged would not receive a rebate. Instead, <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill> would direct any fines collected from gougers to a program that largely benefits the Northeast and the Midwest. Previous legislation on this matter directed that any fines collected from price gouging be returned to the State where the gouging occurred so that the consumers could be reimbursed. <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>, however, directs that all of these funds  instead be placed in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance, LIHEAP, fund. Unfortunately for the residents of Florida, this is a fund that they get little benefit from. The primary beneficiaries LIHEAP grants are those living in the Northeast and Midwest. While New York and Florida have populations that are nearly equal, New York received 10 times the amount of LIHEAP money that Florida received ($247 million</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is more about show than about substance. Even the comprehensive investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, in the aftermath of hurricane's Katrina and Rita found no gouging or anti-trust violations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real driver of price for gas is the growing global demand for energy. The rapid growth in the worldwide demand for crude oil is being driven primarily by economic growth in China, India and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, during a Congressional hearing on this bill, the proponents of the bill offered some bizarre testimony. When asked if the oil companies were engaging in collusion--which is already illegal--a proponent of the bill offered that what was being engaged in is "conscious parallelism." He then offered that you cannot prove "conscious parallelism" in court, so this bill does virtually nothing to address that. Another advocate for the price-gouging bill testified before the committee  that "drilling [for oil] will do nothing to lower the price of oil." I am concerned that these individuals are so dedicated to an ideology that they defy common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important thing we can do to lower the price of gas for American consumers and to ensure our energy independence is to expand domestic energy production, expand refining capacity in the U.S. by reducing excessive burdens, encouraging more nuclear power, fostering the development of renewable energy, and encouraging conservation. Unfortunately, it took us 12 years to end the Democrat filibuster that kept America from developing more oil and gas off the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS. Last  year we were successful in opening a small portion of the OCS to oil and gas recovery, and I hope that we can build on that success. Also, last year we secured passage of legislation that allows for greater production of oil and gas from Federal lands. Unfortunately, Democrat leaders have introduced legislation and are holding hearings to close off those sources of domestic</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats expression of "outrage" over gas prices is a bit ironic given that they are the ones who have consistently proposed higher gas taxes, higher energy taxes like the proposed BTU tax, and who are presently moving forward with "cap and trade" global warming legislation along the lines of what has been adopted in Europe. As the Washington Post pointed out last month, this cap and trade system has led German consumers to pay 25 percent more for electricity than they did two years  ago, while German utilities are making record profits. This higher cost for electricity has made it difficult for some European countries to compete with cheaper foreign imports, resulting in European workers losing their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rhetoric simply does not match the policies being advocated by the Democrat majority.</paragraph>

Most of these individuals are on a fixed income that already limits their ability to pay for the prescription drugs and medical visits they need. The rising price of gas places them only further into a bind and forces them to make decisions that no American should ever face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I co-sponsored <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill> because I believe it is time for Congress to intervene on behalf of working Americans. This common-sense legislation simply ensures that oil companies play by the rules and offer consumers a fair price for gas, not one that takes advantage of circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a firm believer in the power of the marketplace to deliver the best possible services to American consumers. Free markets drive our economy and make it the most powerful in the world. However, when companies don't play by the rules, they must be punished because it is the consumer that ultimately suffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that passage of this legislation offers important protections to the people of my district in their daily battle with the price of gas. I encourage my colleagues to lend their support as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1252">H.R. 1252</bill>, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, which makes it illegal for any company to sell gasoline at excessive prices or to take advantage of market conditions by increasing prices during an energy crisis. It allows the Federal Trade Commission and the States' Attorneys General to bring lawsuits against corporations that charge excessive prices for gasoline. The bill also permits investigations of companies suspected of price gouging and requires honest and accurate reporting of pricing practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first month of the 110th Congress, the House took away $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies from the oil companies. This money will be reinvested in alternative, renewable energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday the House passed a bill by a bipartisan 345-72 vote, a bill that authorizes the Justice Department to take legal action against OPEC state-controlled entities and governments that conspire to limit the supply or fix the price of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hawaii's consumers pay some of the highest gasoline prices in the Nation. In 1998, the State of Hawaii filed a lawsuit against the major oil companies operating in our state. The lawsuit revealed that 22 percent of an oil company's nationwide dealer profits came from Hawaii, a state that represented only 3 percent of the market. Clearly, Hawaii's consumers were contributing an excessive share of the company's profits in relation to market share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since President Bush took office, gas prices have more than doubled, and previous Congresses have failed to protect consumers from price increases. For the first time in years, Congress has begun exercising its oversight responsibilities. This is important given that the six largest oil companies made $30 billion in profits for the first quarter of 2007, on top of the $125 billion in record profits for 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, which aims to reduce the burden of high energy costs on American families and businesses, build on efforts to increase energy efficiency, lessen our dependence on foreign oil, and cut greenhouse gas emissions in the longer term.</paragraph>
