  <narrative>STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS -- (Senate - June 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5658">S5658</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="Introducing S. 3136. A bill to encourage the entry of felony warrants into the NCIC database by States and provide additional resources for extradition; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3136">S. 3136</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fugitive Information Networked Database Act of 2008, or the FIND Act. This bill provides resources to law enforcement to ensure the entry of felony warrants into the national FBI database and to assist in tracking down and extraditing fugitives. It helps ensure that fugitives who flee their States will be located, apprehended, and brought to justice. It protects our communities by taking dangerous criminals off the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent series of articles in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, anywhere from 1.9 million to 2.7 million felony fugitives are on the run from law enforcement. When State and local law enforcement issue a warrant for a fugitive's arrest, they are expected to enter it into the FBI's National Crime Information Center database as well as into their own State and local databases. The national database is accessible to all State and local law enforcement agencies, which use the national database  to track fugitives around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national database is only as good as the information that States enter into it, however. Too often, State and local law enforcement agencies enter warrants into the State and local databases, but not into the national database. It is estimated that more than a third of all felony warrants have not been entered into the national database. That means anywhere from 800,000 to 1.6 million wanted felons can escape justice and remain at large in our communities simply by crossing State lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless a warrant is entered into the national database, a sheriff or police officer who stops a fugitive has no way of knowing that he is wanted in another jurisdiction--sometimes for a violent crime. Many fugitives go on to commit additional crimes in other States. Some know that if they can flee across State lines, there's a good chance they can--in some cases--get away with murder. This is inexcusable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard a range of reasons why State and local law enforcement have not been entering felony warrants into the national database. Some   reasons are valid. For instance, if law enforcement is using a person suspected of a felony as an informant, it's understandable that they would not want to enter the informant's name into the database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many jurisdictions don't enter warrants into the national database, however, simply because they don't have the time and resources to update and validate warrant entries, which is a resource- and time-intensive process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the burden of warrant entry and validation can be alleviated. By developing new databases, or by upgrading existing ones, to ensure compatibility and interoperability with the national database, State and local law enforcement can facilitate information sharing and seamless warrant entry into databases at all levels of government. With additional resources to hire personnel for the validation process, State and local law enforcement can enter felony warrants into the national database  without worrying about not having the resources to validate them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FIND Act addresses the problem of warrant backlogs by providing State and local law enforcement with the resources necessary to develop and upgrade their systems, and hire additional personnel to perform the validation process. Specifically, it authorizes $25 million for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 for grants to States to develop new systems or upgrade existing systems so that they are interoperable with the NCIC database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another reason law enforcement doesn't enter felony warrants into the national database is concern that the State will not have the resources to extradite the fugitive if he is found outside the State's borders. Helping State and local agencies enter their felony warrants into the national database is therefore only half the battle. We also need to ensure that when a dangerous fugitive is caught, the jurisdiction in which he is wanted can work with the U.S. Marshals Service to extradite him to  face justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I was drafting this bill, I spoke to one sheriff who apprehended an individual wanted for rape in another State. The sheriff notified that State that he had their criminal in custody, but when the State said they didn't have the resources to extradite him, the sheriff had no choice but to free the rapist into his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we in Congress do not provide law enforcement with the basic resources they need to extradite dangerous criminals like this, we fail in our most basic duty to those we represent--the duty to protect them from violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Marshals Service is on the front lines of fugitive apprehension and extradition. We authorized funds several years ago for the development of Regional Fugitive Task Forces that combine the resources and expertise of State and local law enforcement and the U.S. Marshals Service. These task forces have been very successful and could do much more to track down and extradite fugitives if they had the proper resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill authorizes an additional $20 million in fiscal year 2009 to fund existing and develop new regional task forces, and it provides $10 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. It also authorizes $3 million for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 to assist in the extradition of fugitives through the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transport System.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FIND Act provides essential resources to locate, capture, and bring to justice dangerous fugitives. It takes commonsense steps to protect our communities from rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals who have fled across State lines. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 3137. A bill for the relief of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3137">S. 3137</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, his wife, Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez and their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. The Rojas family are Mexican nationals living in the San Jose area of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story of the Rojas family is compelling and I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rojas and his wife Ms. Gonzalez originally came to the United States in 1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr. was just 2 years old. In 1995, they left the country to attend a funeral, and then re-entered on visitor's visas. The family has since expanded to include a son, Alexis Rojas now age 15 and a daughter Tania Rojas now age 14.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated themselves to community involvement, a strong work ethic and volunteerism. They have been paying taxes since their arrival in 1990. The family has been described by their friends and colleagues as a "model American family." I would like to tell you some more about each member of the Rojas family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rojas is a hard-working individual who has been employed by Valley Crest Landscape Maintenance in San Jose, California, for the past 14 years. Currently, Mr. Rojas works on commercial landscaping projects. He is well-respected by his supervisor and his peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time and talents to provide modern green landscaping and a recreational jungle gym to Sherman Oaks Community Charter School, where his two youngest children attend school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Gonzalez, in addition to raising her three children, has been very active in the local community. She has worked to help other immigrants assimilate to American life by working as a translator and a tutor for immigrant children at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School and the Y.M.C.A. Kids after-school program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has also coached soccer teams, and has recently directed a Second Harvest food drive for the school. Ms. Gonzalez also devotes many hours of her time to the organization People Acting in Community Together PACT, where she works to prevent crime, gangs and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to remain in the United States is the impact their deportation would have on their three children. Two of the children, Alexis Rojas age 15 and Tania Rojas age 14, are U.S. citizens. Jorge Rojas, Jr. has lived in the United States since he was a toddler. For these children, this country is the only country they really know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jorge Rojas, Jr. is currently working at Jamba Juice. He graduated from Del Mar High School in 2007 and has been accepted to San Jose City College. However, his dreams and aspirations have been placed on hold because he remains subject to deportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alexis and Tania Rojas are students at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School. They are described by their teachers as "fantastic, wonderful and gifted" students. In fact, the principal at Sherman Oaks has described all three of the children as "honest, hard-working academic honor students" and has commended all of them for their on-campus leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the values we hold dear. I have received 30 letters from the community in support of this family. Enactment of the legislation I have introduced today will enable the Rojas family to continue to make significant contributions to their community as well as the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>SAN JOSE, CA,</narrative>
  <narrative>March 14, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN: We are the Rojas Family: Jorge Rojas, Sr., 43 years old, supervisor, Valley Crest Landscape Co.; Oliva Rojas, 40 years old, tutor, Sherman Oaks Charter School; Jorge Rojas 19 years old, son; Alexis Rojas, 15 years old, son; and Tania Rojas, 14 years old, daughter.</narrative>
  <narrative>The reason for this letter is to ask for your help on our immigration status.</narrative>
  <narrative>We came to the U.S.A. in 1990, there were three in the family at that time: my wife Oliva, my son Jorge, he was l-year and 5 months old, and myself. Years later Alexis and Tania were born in California.</narrative>
  <narrative>After a long immigration process we were denied to stay in the U.S.A. and now we are facing a voluntary departure schedule on or before April 18, 2008, in the meantime we are asking to extend our departure until the kids finish the school year that ends on June 13, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Our main goal is to stay in the U.S.A. as legal residents, my kids were born here and grew up here, even my son Jorge was too young to remember were he was born, this is all that they have ever known. What I want the most now is that my kids keep going with their hopes and dreams and be able to stay in school and someday be great citizens in this Great Country.</narrative>
  <narrative>After several changes in immigration laws, we started a legal process trying to get a legal residence in this country. One day we knew thru other people that someone in the Los Angeles area could help us out to get a legal residence, wrongly we started a political asylum process, that later will be an application for cancellation of removal, we were misled, we were told that its only a way to get a hearing with an immigration judge and because we were in the U.S.A. for more than 10 years and  we have 2 citizen kids will be a lot easier, afterwards we found out that this person was not a lawyer and he was a notary, whom only submit political asylum applications and then turn everything to a lawyers that represent us in the hearings. A lot of trips to L.A. but one day received a call telling me that me case was move out to San Francisco and the next hearing will be there.</narrative>
  <narrative>At the first hearing in San Francisco the Judge instructed me to get a lawyer that represent us in the upcoming process. We hire a lawyer with immigration speciality, a real lawyer, it was on March 2003. He represent us I think the best way that he could, after almost 3 years on April 2006, we were denied to stay and granted with voluntary departure within 60 days, this happen on April 2006.</narrative>
  <narrative>Still we had another chance; appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, so in May 2006, we hired another lawyer with better knowledge in appeals. Our efforts to stay legally here never give up.</narrative>
  <narrative>On February 24, 2008 we received a decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals saying that we have to leave the country voluntary in the remaining 32 days after the final decision that will be made on March 17, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Now our last hope is if you can help us.</narrative>
  <narrative>We are a very close family that always been working and doing voluntary jobs and time to the community where for 14 years we belong participating not only with our kids, we were among parents and teacher helping.</narrative>
  <narrative>My wife Oliva has been a soccer coach and she is involved in the community association named "PACT" (Parents Acting in Community Together), helping too in the distribution of food with "The Second Harvest Food Program". Myself I was a soccer coach too and involved in a lot of jobs done to the Sherman Oaks Charter School, were my three kids attended.</narrative>
  <narrative>My kids now are emotionally affected because they can not understand all that is happening to us and of course to them, for me is really hard to explain them.</narrative>
  <narrative>Even so we all know the decision that had been made, we keep on going everything; work, school and time together as a family. We have our hopes and faith in something or somebody that is going to help us to stay in The U.S.A.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am pretty sure that with your help my whole family will keep this faith, hopes and dreams going and we will be part of this great country.</narrative>
  <narrative>I want to say ahead that myself and my family are deeply grateful for you time and for whatever you can do for us.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you so much.</narrative>
  <narrative>Update on this letter</narrative>
  <narrative>On March 17, 2008 we were granted by de I.C.E. Office with 60 days more until my kids can finish the school year, now our voluntary departure is schedule on or before June 18, 2008. That gives us more comfort and time; hoping that you can help us.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thanks again for your time and help.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative/>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, June 13, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN: In late February, staff from my office met with Jorge  Rojas and his wife, Oliva Gonzalez Rojas in regards to their immigration case and that of their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. After exhausting all appeals to the decision of the Immigration Judge, the family was scheduled to depart the United States under an order of voluntary departure to Mexico on April 18, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>My office supported their request to get an extension of the voluntary departure order until June 18, 2008 so that the two younger United States citizen children could finish the school year. As of this moment the family is still scheduled to leave the United States on June 18th. At the time of the first meeting, my office also referred the Rojas family to their U.S. Senators offices to inquire about the possibility of a private bill being introduced.</narrative>
  <narrative>Since February, my office has received many calls from individuals supportive of the Rojas family and concerned about their impending departure. My office was also contacted by People Acting in Community Together (PACT), members of the Santa Clara Interfaith Council, Santa Clara County Office of Human Relations, YMCA, and Sherman Oaks Community Charter School.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, on March 9, 2008, the Rojas family participated in a community forum organized by First Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto. The Rojas family participated on a panel which included a San Francisco Immigration Judge, the Director of the Santa Clara County Office of Human Relations, and one of my staff members. The event was co-sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Palo Alto, the Santa Clara Council of Churches, Multifaith Voices for Peace and Justice, and El Buen Pastor, Iglesia  Episcopal Church (Redwood City). The organizers have verified that there were a total of 115 attendees at the event, many of whom still inquire about the Rojas family and their situation.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is apparent that the Rojas family is a hard-working, beloved family that has contributed much to their community through their volunteer work. My office has been as supportive as possible of this family and of their efforts to exhaust all possible avenues to remain legally in the United States.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your attention to this important matter.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>ZOE LOFGREN,</narrative>

  <narrative>LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE,</narrative>
  <narrative>San Jose, CA, 12 March 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN: Jorge G. Rojas has been working for our company ValleyCrest Landscape Maintenance since 1994.</narrative>
  <narrative>Not only is he a valuable member of our team but has been instrumental in energizing the water conservation and sustainability issues as they relate to the LEED efforts in the Bay Area for commercial landscaping.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jorge Rojas is a technician in Urban Construction. He obtained his degree from Conalet Technical School in Guadalajara.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jorge's skills in that area will be a great loss not only to the company, but to the state of sustainability and green programs in Silicon Valley.</narrative>
  <narrative>Commercial clients are seeking LEED certification for their existing buildings and industry talent in this arena is critical.</narrative>
  <narrative>We at ValleyCrest urge our to consider drafting a private bill to secure permanent residency for him and his direct family.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jorge is also seeking an extension from the Immigration office to allow his American resident children to complete their graduation.</narrative>
  <narrative>We would appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this request.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Nada Duna,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>CHARTER SCHOOL,</narrative>
  <narrative>San Jose, CA, March 13, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I write this letter in support of the Oliva Gonzales Rojas and her family. Many years ago she and her husband, Jorge, left Mexico to come to the United States. At that time their oldest son was two years old. They have lived in the United States in California for the last eight en years.</narrative>
  <narrative>During that time they have consistently demonstrated their commitment to this country, appreciating the opportunities the United States has afforded them. In addition to their oldest son, they have two other children--a son and daughter, citizens of the United States. These children have demonstrated strong academic skills, and they have shown positive and consistent leadership. They understand the importance of service to community.</narrative>
  <narrative>Yesterday, Alexis, their son volunteered at Sherman Oaks, organizing our book room and hanging posters on the wall. He has received excellent modeling from his parents who have donated many hours of service to our school. They have demonstrated discipline and excellence in their work. Olivia works at Sherman Oaks as yard duty and as a tutor. Jorge, the father, has developed a highly successful landscaping design business, which caters to large-scale corporations and business parks.</narrative>
  <narrative>Oliva and Jorge are decent people, who came to America to live the American dream. For eighteen years they have worked hard, rearing their children, teaching them the values of perseverance, diligence, and sacrifice to achieve and to thrive. Pillars of the community, the family is universally loved and respected by all at Sherman Oaks School. It was Jorge, who planted trees and fixed the irrigation system to maintain the lush fields that are a mecca to our children and their families. Oliva serves  as the liaison for our school to the neighborhood. She tutors their children, organizes support for families in need, and integrates new immigrants into the school. Oliva and Jorge are good people, model citizens, and contributors to society.</narrative>
  <narrative>With great respect, I plead with you to consider the merit of this case. Specifically, I request that the family may stay, at least until the end of June, so that their children can complete this school year. Thank you for your consideration.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Nancy Atkinson,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>COMMUNITY TOGETHER,</narrative>
  <narrative>San Jose, CA, March 17, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN: I am writing to express my strong support for Oliva Rojas and her family and to ask for your assistance in postponing--and we hope canceling--their order of removal from the DOHS.</narrative>
  <narrative>Oliva was an active PACT volunteer leader for several years in the early 2000s and has continued to support our organization since then. PACT is a multi-ethnic, inter-faith grassroots organization that empowers every day people to create a more just community.</narrative>
  <narrative>For more than 20 years, PACT has helped ordinary people win extraordinary victories for our community, not by speaking for them, but by teaching them how to speak, act, and engage in the public arena for themselves. Thousands of PACT-trained, volunteer community leaders have worked together across ethnic, religious and socio-economic lines to create innovative and effective public policies that have improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people throughout Santa Clara County. For example,  PACT co-founded Santa Clara County's innovative Children's Health Initiative, which provides access to health insurance to all low-income children in the County and has served as a model for similar programs in twenty-three other California counties plus many other states, as well.</narrative>
  <narrative>Oliva was active with the PACT parent group at her child's charter school. She put in many hours every week to help improve the school for the benefit of all the children. She was also a leader in the effort to fight crime, gangs, and drug dealing in the neighborhood around the school, and helped organize large meetings with this purpose.</narrative>
  <narrative>I've been working for more than 15 years to involve everyday people in the public life of their communities. While most people feel disconnected and apathetic, Oliva is full of hope and exudes inspiration about her community. Even though she is new to this country, she embodies the values we hold dear, as individuals and as a society: committed to her family, hard working, involved in the community, participant in the democratic process.</narrative>
  <narrative>Our community needs Oliva and her family. We need so many more people like her. We would be a much weaker community without her.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your assistance.</narrative>

  <narrative>HONORABLE SENATOR FEINSTEIN: I am writing in behalf of the Jorge and Oliva Rojas Family and their eminent "removal" from the United States. I have had the good fortune to have known the Rojas family since 1999, when Tania Rojas was in my Kindergarten class. We did home visits that year, and I was immediately impressed with the close family ties and structure within the Rojas household. Tania was a fantastic student and we had a great year. Her mother, Oliva, was a ready volunteer for  anything that she could help out with at school, and was always an integral part of our school community. Two years later, I had Alexis in my fourth grade class. Another wonderful, intelligent, GATE (Gifted and Talented) student. That year, he talked about being an astronaut some day. And, of course, Oliva continued to do anything and everything to help out. Always with a positive "can-do" attitude and sense of humor.</narrative>
  <narrative>Oliva started out volunteering, but because she is so capable, she was soon hired by our school to do almost everything! As a charter school, we have had more flexibility in hiring than some schools. In the past, Oliva has helped out as a substitute, an art teacher, yard duty, tutor, and parent liaison. Students love and respect her. She is someone who is always willing to help out where needed. She has been a lifesaver to me, as a teacher, many times. Whether it's making copies for me at the  last minute, or helping out with our 4th grade overnight at Sanborn Park when my partner teacher got sick, or helping me design and build our altar for Day of the Dead--Oliva is always there. Her  background design for the 4th grade Opera every year, is always spectacular. She helps students with homework. She helps our Kindergartners in</narrative>
  <narrative>Oliva soon started working in the YMCA's after school and summer school program, where, once again, she was loved by all who worked with her. I believe she has worked with them for over 4 years. I am attaching this year's YMCA brochure, which, ironically, came to my house just this week. On page 7 is a picture of smiling staff members. Center front, is Oliva Rojas.</narrative>
  <narrative>Every October, the Rojas family participates with my husband with his theater group, Familia Aztlan, in their multicultural event celebrating Day of the Dead in San Jose. Both Jorge Sr, and Jr, along with Tania and Alexis, participate in the parade, wielding large, life sized, skeleton puppets. Oliva puts her creativity to use, painting the faces of children and adults alike.</narrative>
  <narrative>Oliva's removal from this country in mid April will put an extreme hardship on all the students and teachers at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School in San Jose for this school year. As a teacher at this school for 10 years, I can truthfully say that Oliva Rojas' position at our school touches every single student. I can't imagine how we would explain to our students why she was all of a sudden gone--mid year. What could we say to explain it to them? And they will ask.</narrative>
  <narrative>I respectfully ask for your intervention, in whatever way you can, to get an extension of at least until June for the removal of the Rojas Family. Ideally, this family merits full time, legal status in this country based on their many civic and artistic contributions, stable family, and work ethic. But, if this is not possible, at least, for the sake of the students, families, and faculty of Sherman Oaks Community Charter School, please intervene for an extension until June, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is truly this country's loss if/when the Rojas Family is "removed."</narrative>
  <narrative>Respectfully and hopefully,</narrative>
  <narrative>BARBARA LYNN,</narrative>

  <narrative>SENATOR FEINSTEIN, I am writing to you because of my concern for a co-worker and friend, Oliva Rojas. Although she and her family have been trying to legally stay in the United States for many years, her appeals have run out and she and her family will be leaving on a volunteer departure on April 18th.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am Oliva's supervisor at Sherman Oaks Elementary School in San Jose in the Campbell Elementary School District, a bilingual, dual-immersion school. Oliva reports to me everyday for 2 hours and works with grades K-6 with a specialty in Kindergarten. (She works other hours for a different supervisor.)</narrative>
  <narrative>I can't think of a time when I have been so disappointed in our government. This is a family that is a vital part of our community and Oliva is a valued co-worker. Because she is smart, trusted, responsible and nurturing, Oliva has been given many duties that go beyond her job description. (At one time, we were a charter school and Oliva was even able to substitute teach in classrooms and did a fabulous job.) Oliva's family has always been the first to step up and take action if something needed  to be done at our school to improve the grounds or atmosphere. They would be the first to volunteer to help at the many gatherings we would have. Oliva and her family are some of the most involved, unselfish people I have ever met.</narrative>
  <narrative>If Oliva leaves on April 18th, it would be a hardship to not only me and her fellow coworkers, but to each and every child she works with on a daily basis. We depend on her to be there because she handles the children in a very special loving way. Nobody could replace her. I have tried to fill her position with other employees at times when she is sick or at immigration hearings and it has not worked out. We need Oliva to be with us throughout this school year and beyond.</narrative>
  <narrative>I would like you to take a look at her case and help her and her family out in this matter. Please do whatever you can do to keep the family here in the United States.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>San Jose, CA, March 11, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN: We ask you to please urge ICE to allow Jorge Rojas, Sr., Oliva Rojas (his wife) and Jorge Rojas, Jr. (their 19 year old son) to remain in this country at least till the end of this school year, June 13, so that their U.S. citizen children, Alexis and Tania, may finish school. In fact, I would hope that the whole Rojas family could stay legally for the rest of their lives.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Rojas family has been a fixture of our community in San Jose for at least 16 years. We raised our sons, their Jorge Jr. and our Sam, together from 2nd grade on (both are now 19 and 20 years old respectively), spending many hours together. We were active together in People Acting Together (PACT) successfully pushing for health insurance for all children in Santa Clara Co. in 2000. Oliva is well-know to all children at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School (Campbell Union School District) due  to her early volunteer work at the school, then her paid position as an aide, and then as a YMCA worker running after school programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jorge Rojas, Sr. has been an active parent leader in the Sherman Oaks Community Charter School neighborhood in west center San Jose. It was Jorge, as a trained landscaping professional, who enlisted other parents to reseed and regrade parts of the school playground and to repair the irrigation system when the school district had no funds to do so. It was Jorge who led the work to plant trees from Our City Forest in front of the school to reduce heat and glare. It was Jorge who volunteered his  weekend operating the equipment and then doing the hand digging necessary to install a French drainage system (6 feet deep) into holes cut in the concrete to ensure proper drainage.</narrative>
  <narrative>It was both Jorge and Oliva who for years volunteered to coach soccer teams for neighborhood children after school. As bilingual parents, Jorge and Oliva have been key to bridging the cu1tural/language gap between neighbors in our multicultural neighborhood and school community. If this family leaves, they will leave a big hole in our community which has come to depend on them for leadership, translation, advice, hard work, and friendship. They will also leave a big hole in the hearts of many  of us who count them as close friends.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is tragic that a whole community would suffer such a loss due to a legal error made by an untrained, irresponsible "notario" years ago. This family has spent thousands and thousands of dollars in an effort to overcome the error of that notario and to legalize their status.</narrative>
  <narrative>We ask for your assistance on behalf of the Rojas Family and our community.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="Introducing S. 3140. A bill to provide that 4 of the 21 weeks of parental leave made available to a Federal employee shall be paid leave, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3140">S. 3140</bill>] Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the bipartisan Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. I introduce this bill with Senators Warner, Clinton, Kerry, Schumer, Mikulski, Sanders, and Durbin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has a simple and yet important requirement: that Federal employees be granted 4 weeks of paid paternity and maternity leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government is the country's largest employer, with more than 2.7 million employees. My state of Virginia is home to more than 100,000 Federal employees. As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government should be the leader in workplace policy. The Federal Government should provide benefits that are equal to what we call best practices in the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, according to the Office of Personnel Management, more than half of the Federal Government's employees will become eligible for retirement within the next 10 years. The Federal workforce is aging faster than the private workforce. The benefits desired by younger workers are offered by private sector employers, but not by the Federal Government. Although the Federal Government cannot compete with private sector salaries, we should be offering comparable benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current parental leave law for Federal employees is in need of an update. The Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act provides that, of the 12 weeks of unpaid leave guaranteed by the Family and Medical Leave Act, federal employees will be allowed to substitute 4 weeks of paid leave, as well as any accrued annual or sick leave for the birth or adoption of a child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This requirement mirrors a recent provision put forward by the Senate Armed Services Committee in the National Defense Authorization Act, which would allow 21 days of paid paternity leave for our military personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are introducing today is also an issue of fairness for the working family. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that more than 70 percent of women with children over the age of 1 are in the workforce and that both parents work in most families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families, in today's highly competitive jobs environment, there is little workforce flexibility to help working  women and men care for their families and still succeed at their jobs. This is particularly true for those Americans whose economic security is most at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note the parental leave practices of non-Federal employers. Research by the Joint Economic Committee has found that Fortune 100 firms offer paid leave typically lasting 6 to 8 weeks. Additionally, most of America's economic rivals provide paid parental leave, as do many other nations. The European Union requires that member countries offer 14 weeks of paid leave and most offer more than the required amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By contrast, our Nation's current laws force healthy, long-term federal employees to save up their sick days and vacation time so they can use this paid time off to care for their newborn or newly adopted child. Asking employees to cobble together accrued leave makes it difficult for relatively new employees or those who experience health problems to save up enough time for parental leave. We owe our civil servants a more thoughtful, worker-friendly policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that the House of Representatives recently reported a similar bill out of the appropriate House committee by a strong bipartisan vote. I hope the Senate begins similar action on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this pro-family, pro-Federal worker legislation.</paragraph>
