    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate one of Louisiana's favorite sons, NBA coach Avery Johnson, on the occasion of his receiving an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater, Southern University, at its upcoming fall commencement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in New Orleans, Avery Johnson has known success at every level of basketball. In 1983 he led the St. Augustine High School Purple Knights to an undefeated season culminating with a Class 4A Louisiana State championship. He would go on to star on the Southern University Jaguars basketball team, setting NCAA Division I records for both season and career averages in assists that still stand today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, Avery Johnson began his career in the NBA, where he would spend 16 seasons. Once again he found success with the San Antonio Spurs by taking them to their first NBA title in 1999 over the New York Knicks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Presently, Avery Johnson serves as the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks, where his star has only continued to shine brighter. Now in his third full season as coach, he has led the Mavericks to their first Western Conference title, been named 2006 NBA Coach of the Year, and won 150 games faster than any other coach in NBA history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his high achievement in sports and service to the community, Avery Johnson continues to leave a mark on the world, of which we are all very proud.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
