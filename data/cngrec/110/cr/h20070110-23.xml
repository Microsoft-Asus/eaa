  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, and I am glad it will pass today in the House of Representatives, because for too long the disparity between the wealthiest and the poor has been going on and continuing to grow in America. And it is in no small part due to the Republicans not raising the minimum wage in almost 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine this, you work for $5.15 an hour. You work all year round, and not your take-home pay but your gross pay is $10,700. That is $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minimum wage has not gone up. Real income, the buying power of the dollar has gone down for Americans. And the cost of health insurance, of gasoline, of home heating, of tuition at college has gone up by $5,000 since the year 2000. So this is an important law to pass today.</paragraph>
