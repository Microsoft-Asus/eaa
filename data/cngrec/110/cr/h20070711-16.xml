  <narrative>IT'S TIME WE END THIS WAR -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7496]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. HALL of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a recent CRS report shows that the United States is now spending $10 billion a month fighting the war in Iraq. That's over $2.5 billion a week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what does the American taxpayer get for this $10 billion a month? An Army being broken by repeated deployments; a National Guard that is unready or unable to respond to natural disasters or terrorist attacks at home because many of our men and women are in Iraq and most of our equipment is; an escalation in Iraq that has resulted in more death and little reduction in violence; an Iraqi government that is unable to govern, Iraqi security forces that refuse to fully stand up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war in Iraq has cost every man, woman and child in my district $3,077. For over $3,000 a person, the people in my district have gotten a war that was a strategic mistake and has made them less safe. It is time we end this war.</paragraph>
