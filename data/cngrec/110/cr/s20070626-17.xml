    <paragraph>Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that there be a limitation of 26 first-degree amendments to <bill type="s" number="1639">S. 1639</bill>, the immigration bill. This is the list of the 13 Democratic amendments, the 12 Republican amendments, and 1 managers' amendment, which each are at the desk; that there be a time limitation of 1 hour equally divided for each amendment; that they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments under the same time limitation; and that upon the disposition of the amendments, the  bill be read the third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>

    <paragraph>I object, Mr. President. We just received the substitute.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from South Carolina objects.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I renew my request and ask that we have an hour and a half per amendment, with the same conditions I just propounded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how about 2 hours per amendment, with the same conditions and provisions in the previous unanimous consent requests I made.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>

    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, with all deference to the majority leader, this procedure has excluded many of us from our right to offer amendments on the floor. I think he understands our discomfort with this process. There will not be an amount of time that will pave over the loss of our rights to offer amendments on this very important bill that needs to be dealt with. So it is not in terms of trying to delay what the majority leader is trying to do, but there is  not going to be a period of time on this particular set of amendments, unless there is a set of amendments that we will be allowed, as Senators in the United States of America, to offer on behalf of our constituencies.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>So I take it there is an objection.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, he always comes directly to the point. I appreciate him and his objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I tried to line up these 26 amendments for debate and vote. We have been told that no matter what the time per amendment is that would be allocated, that is not good enough. I also included second-degree amendments. That was objected to. I have no choice but to offer, after consultation with the Republican leadership, an amendment that contains these Democratic and Republican amendments and ask that it be divided  so that these  26 Senators may get votes in relation to their amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now call up that amendment, which is at the desk, on behalf of Senators Kennedy and Specter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will report the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to read.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in light of our discussion with the distinguished majority leader under which we won't take further action until tomorrow, so we can begin to digest this mammoth amendment, I move to waive reading of the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <narrative>(The amendment is printed in today's Record under "Text of Amendments.")</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I did have a conservation with the junior Senator from Louisiana and a number of his colleagues. I think it is only fair that they have the evening and night to work on this big piece of legislation. It took a lot longer to get here, as always happens. It is "always on its way," be here "right away," "another 5 minutes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, it took several hours. I think in fairness, it is only the right thing to do. We are going to come back at 10 o'clock in the morning. There will be no morning business tomorrow. I would say to all Senators, there is a briefing that starts at 10 o'clock with Admiral McConnell. I have not had the opportunity to speak to him yet. But I am confident that for any Senators who are unable to go to that briefing because of being obligated to be here on the Senate floor, another time can be  arranged that he and/or his staff would be happy to come and visit with another group of Senators. So we are not going to be in recess during the time of that briefing. But I would hope tomorrow we can get some movement on this bill, and the Senator from Louisiana and others will better understand this tomorrow, and make a decision of how if, in fact, they want to proceed, along with a number of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that being the case, I express my appreciation to the Senator from Louisiana and his colleagues we met with earlier today.</paragraph>
