  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week the Senate passed <bill type="h" number="3580">H.R. 3580</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, and sent it on to the President for his signature. This is the biggest drug safety reform in a decade, and I was proud to support it. Among other things, this legislation will help the FDA do a better job approving and monitoring prescription drugs and medical devices, encourage the research and development of medical treatments for children, and provide needed resources  to the FDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that the incentive which encourages more studies of medicines in children was preserved in the final version of this bill. Over the last 10 years, this program has helped provide worried parents and concerned physicians with information they need to make better decisions in prescribing treatment for young children. By extending drug patents in exchange for additional research on how these drugs affect children, this program has prompted studies on 144 products and led to 122  label changes on some of the most frequently prescribed medicines for children. Clearly the system works and should be continued, especially since to date only a third of drugs prescribed to children have been studied and labeled for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also am pleased that this legislation reinforces FDA's broad authority over prescription drug labels. Under current law, States are preempted from substituting their judgment for the FDA's scientific decisions based on exhaustive reviews of clinical data. If this weren't the case, medicine labels would become so overwhelmed with warnings designed to avert lawsuits that most Americans will simply stop paying attention to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Congress has decided to give FDA the authority to make expedited labeling changes, so that when prescription drug safety problems are identified the FDA and drug manufacturers can work together to quickly update product labels to ensure that the American people have the latest safety information. If a drug manufacturer comes to the FDA in good faith to discuss the possible need for an expedited labeling change--and if the FDA does not respond in a timely manner or decides that the  science does not require a labeling change--then that drug manufacturer should not be subject to frivolous lawsuits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that Congress came together in a bipartisan manner to approve this legislation. It can serve as a model for how the parties can come together to pass other meaningful bills during the remainder of the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
