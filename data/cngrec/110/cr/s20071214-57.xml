  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Before I ask this matter be completed, I want to say here is an example of cooperation between two Senators. Senators Dorgan and Kyl have worked on this for some time. There were some problems that were initially identified, but they have been able to work through this. This is a very important piece of legislation for Senator Kyl. For Senator Dorgan, it is an issue that is in his committee. I think it is terrific that this matter is done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The bill (<bill type="h" number="3739">H.R. 3739</bill>) was ordered to a third reading, was read the third time, and passed.</chair>
