  <narrative>EQUAL PAY -- (Senate - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3391">S3391</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is hard for me to understand how the Senate cannot support equal pay for equal work, the same for women as for men. That happened yesterday, on a vote of 56 in favor of proceeding to the bill on equal pay for equal work and 43 against. I do not understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is worse is my wife and many other spouses of Senators cannot understand that. I assure you, they are letting their husbands and spouses know how they feel--that they cannot understand how the Senate cannot proceed to a bill for equal pay for equal work for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the next time we try to move to a bill for which we have to hit the 60-vote threshold to get over the filibuster to get to the bill--we need 4 more votes--I hope somewhere over there we are going to be able to get them when we bring up equal pay for equal work for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
