    <paragraph>Mr. President, we began, as we have just spoken about, a very good debate today on minimum wage. Senator Gregg offered his line-item veto amendment. We had very stimulating debate on that matter from both sides. I filed cloture on that amendment. The cloture vote will occur on Wednesday, unless we decide to move it up earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, today I filed cloture on the underlying bill. The Republican leader and I discussed that at some length. If cloture is not invoked on the Gregg amendment, then we will go immediately to a cloture vote on the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the live quorum, with respect to these two cloture motions, be waived.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
