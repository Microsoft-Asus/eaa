  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on July 26, I introduced critical legislation to stem the rising tide of dogfighting in our country. Dogfighting is one of society's most barbaric and inhumane activities. The dogs are mistreated, starved and conditioned for aggression, and then allowed to literally destroy one another in the ring. As we have read in the recent indictment of Atlanta Falcon's quarterback Michael Vick on dogfighting charges, poor-performing dogs are tortured, maimed, and killed. This illegal  and despicable activity has no place in a civilized society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, dogfighting has expanded its hold in recent years. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that 40,000 people in the United States are involved in professional dogfighting, and fight purses reach as high as $100,000. As many as 100,000 additional people are involved in "streetfighting," informal dogfighting that often involves young people in gangs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would place a Federal ban on all aspects of dogfighting activity from owning to transporting to training dogs for the purpose of fighting, to participating as a spectator at dogfighting ventures. I hope this legislation will end the practice of dogfighting in our country, once and for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress's authority to make the lucrative commercial aspects of dogfighting a crime cannot be doubted. Just 2 years ago, the Supreme Court made clear in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress's authority under the commerce clause extends to local activities that are an integral component of interstate criminal activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is well within that standard. As demonstrated in the Vick indictment and by the many law enforcement records, animal welfare reports, and economic studies that will be entered into the Record on this bill the--dogfighting industry has become nationwide in scope, and Congress is well within its authority to address both the nationwide framework and localized branches that are a critical part of that extensive criminal venture. We are dealing with a criminal industry has developed  into a multifaceted, national and international commercial market that depends heavily upon illegal trafficking between States. Dogfighting is an inherently commercial and economic activity that has a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dogfighting is an interconnected, nationwide, lucrative commercial industry. In addition to high-stakes gambling, dogfighters exchange tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually on the purchase and sale of fighting dogs. Dog fighters also make top dollar by breeding or selling "stud" privileges for fighting dogs, and can make top dollar by breeding dogs that have proven themselves in the ring by killing multiple other dogs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This extensive commercial venture also requires trafficking in the specialized equipment necessary to train and house fighting dogs. There are even underground transport services to courier these dogs from one match to the next--assuming they survive. Dog fighters also make a living handling and training fighting dogs for well-funded sponsors--as we saw in the Vick indictment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It could not be clearer that the overwhelming majority of dog fights--if not every single dog fight--are truly economic endeavors that involve some element of interstate commerce, such as animals, equipment, breeders, or spectators having traveled across State lines. Many dog fights are conducted for the purposes of illegal gambling, and some gambling on the sidelines is almost always present at these fights. Dogfighting also burdens interstate commerce by increasing the risk of injury or disease  to both animals and humans, including dog bites, rabies, and heartworms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's more, small, localized dogfighting ventures, when viewed in the aggregate, have a substantial impact upon interstate commerce. As the allegations I mentioned earlier against Michael Vick and his codefendants demonstrate, large amounts of money are at stake in dogfighting matches, and winners often take home all or some portion of entry fees paid by other participants. The individual dogs used in fighting can have a commercial value of between hundreds of dollars and tens of thousands of  dollars per animal. All of the activities associated with dogfighting, including gambling and other illegal activities, equipment outlays, breeding expenses, and promotion costs are not only inherently commercial in nature but transcend State boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By way of example, there are dozens of Federal criminal prohibitions on the local creation, possession, and sale of narcotics and narcotic-making equipment. Congress recognized that the illicit drug industry had become nationwide in scope, and chose to exercise its constitutional power to address the localized branches of that extensive criminal venture. Likewise, this bill responds to the proliferation of dog fighting into a nationwide criminal network of local ventures, which Congress is similarly  authorized to address. Just look at the Endangered Species Act, which broadly restricts the killing, taking, or breeding of certain wild animals, in order to effectuate Congress's goal of preventing the extinction of imperiled species. The ESA has been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress's authority by every federal appeals court to address the issue, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to upset those judgments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effects of dogfighting on interstate commerce are neither indirect, remote, nor attenuated. Regulation of dogfighting is necessary to prevent and eliminate burdens upon interstate commerce. In addition, the regulation of dogfighting is an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme, the Animal Welfare Act, which mandates the humane treatment of animals in our society.</paragraph>
