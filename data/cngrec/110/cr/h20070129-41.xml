    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this weekend there was an extraordinary event right outside these windows. I come to the floor this evening to celebrate the hundreds of thousands of people who gathered on the Mall this Saturday because they have had enough of this immoral occupation in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Groups like Code Pink, United for Peace and Justice, Win Without War, and Peace Action did an exceptional job of organizing the march and rallying their members. We were fortunate to have many celebrity activists in attendance, as well as several Members of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what made the event successful was the energy and the passion in the crowd. It was a testament to the power of the grassroots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds of thousands, from the stage as far as the eye could see, packed on the mall, standing together to send a powerful message that Americans want to bring our troops home from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds of thousands standing together to say that 4 years of bloodshed is enough, that over 3,050 lost American lives is over 3,050 too many for a war we never should have started in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds of thousands standing together to register the disgust with the President's Iraq policy, the staggering civilian casualties, the billions upon billions of dollars wasted, human rights abused, our global credibility shattered, terrorists emboldened rather than defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every objective measure we could possibly use leads to the conclusion that what we are doing in Iraq has been a tragic failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And everyone can see that, Mr. Speaker, except the President, the President of the United States, who is asking us to sacrifice more of our tax dollars and more lives and limbs so he can win in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know what they say: The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. Fortunately, we have an antidote to this insanity. It is not another Iraq study group. It is not another bipartisan committee to debate and deliberate while more people die. It is not a nonbinding resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is comprehensive legislation that would have all of our troops home safely, out of Iraq, and contractors out of Iraq within 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is <bill type="h" number="508">H.R. 508</bill>, the Bring Our Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act, which I introduced with my colleagues, Congresswomen Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters, earlier this month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the real authors of this bill, Mr. Speaker, were the hundreds of thousands of people marching on the Mall this Saturday and the millions more Americans who they represent. By offering <bill type="h" number="508">H.R. 508</bill>, we are giving voice to their will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the marchers came back to Congress today to share their views in person. They want their elected representatives to know how strongly they oppose the continuing occupation and how strongly they support <bill type="h" number="508">H.R. 508</bill>, which would fully fund a safe military withdrawal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has challenged us to issue a plan. We have, and people gathered on the Mall this weekend showed their support. Enough is enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the name of national security, fiscal sanity and common decency, I ask my colleagues, sign on to <bill type="h" number="508">H.R. 508</bill> and bring our troops home.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
