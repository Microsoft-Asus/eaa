    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what kind of Nation would we be if we did not stand up and speak out in favor of liberty everywhere in the world?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 6, 1941, right here in this Congress, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt enunciated a voice for all the world, our four essential human freedoms, freedom from fear, freedom from want, freedom of speech and freedom to worship God in one's own way. These are the freedoms we fought two world wars for and won. These are the freedoms we must endorse everywhere in the world. I encourage the current leaders of Communist China to support these four essential human freedoms everywhere in the  world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soon, very soon, the Olympic games will be held in China, and wouldn't it be grand if China would compete fairly and openly on a level playing field, not just in the Olympic games but in marketing their products as well. We must ship our values overseas, not our jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the goal of our presence here on this floor. We must represent people here in these United States, not in China.</paragraph>
