  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is nice to be here with you in the chair, since we are discussing issues that are very important, of which you have been a part for a while around here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I wish to talk for a minute about the good news. The good news is that crude oil prices have gone down $16 a barrel in 3 days. That is a bigger drop in the prices of crude oil in history in terms of actual dollars. One of those 3 days it was an $8 drop. I do not know what this bodes for the future, but today it looks good, it sounds good, and it ought to make us feel good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we ought to do is something positive that will have a chance of showing the world; that is, the world that is buying and selling oil and buying and trading oil futures on the market, that there is going to be more oil coming on because the United States has awakened; we have decided that after 27 years of being asleep. We have all this property called the continental offshore, which is owned by the people of our country, and for 27 years we kept all but small portions of it under lock and  key. We had decided it was not worth opening that to drilling, even in modern days, when we have the cleanest and best way to go into deep waters and drill for oil. With oil spills being at a minimum, we kept it locked up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The year before last, we passed a bill that started the process of opening parts of this great valuable offshore owned by our people. Yes, the President of the United States waited around for us to act and finally decided he would lift the Executive ban, the Presidential moratorium that was on 85 percent of the offshore that has been locked up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no bones about it, now, when people say we have already let a lot of that land out to bid, 85 percent of the offshore--85 percent of the offshore--was under lock and key by moratorium until the President lifted the Executive ban. We now have imposed, on that same 85 percent, millions and millions of acres of offshore property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we have the situation where, come the first day of October, the Congress will have to act to put on another 1-year moratorium; the moratorium of Congress is 1 year at a time. We will have to act to put it on or there will be no moratorium, and it will be open for leases pursuant to the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, I attended a workshop held by the Energy Committee to discuss the price of oil. We had two leading experts, and we were very fortunate, except that I would say we have heard about enough from experts, and we have talked enough about the problem. We ought to do something within the next couple weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at this workshop was Dan Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, publisher of a very popular book on oil. He was accompanied by Roger Diwan of PFC Energy. Their message to us this morning, with many Senators asking questions, coming in and out of the room, was the same as I have been hearing from leading economists for the last several weeks. What did they say? Supply and demand problems are the reason why gas prices are so high, why crude oil prices are so high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader stopped by our workshop this morning to talk about the bill he has introduced today on speculation. He said that while he understood that speculation was not the only problem, he thought it was a big part of it and we should start there. Well, obviously, he controls how we start, so perhaps we will start with speculation. I, for one, think speculation is not nearly the problem of supply and demand, it is not nearly the problem of opening more property we own for drilling.  I think that is the real problem: to put more of that out to the oil operators of the country and get started on some real new production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am puzzled by the decision our leader has made about going first with speculation, antispeculation statutes. I am not against looking at that, but if there is something we can do to increase transparency, that is fine. But why would we start by addressing problems when the experts tell us they are not the real problem?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do the experts say? I will share with you a few comments of what they say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Yergin, a great expert, a very fluent man:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rise in oil prices can be explained by basic economic factors, such as limited growth in supplies in recent years, a weakening dollar, a global surge in energy demand, and a string of production disruptions in countries such as Nigeria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is speculation, but speculation, under most circumstances, is a positive thing. It provides liquidity and allows people to hedge their risks. And it provides price discovery. It can help allocate oil availability over time, depending on the pattern of future prices and so on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not speculation, it's supply and demand. We don't have excess capacity in the world anymore, and that's what you're seeing in oil prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why would we start with speculation, instead of supply and demand? Eighty-five percent of the continental U.S. lands offshore are being locked up by Congress; that is, we have a prohibition. The most conservative estimates of how much oil is in the Atlantic and Pacific offshore is 14 billion barrels. Now, I actually think that is totally wrong. I think we have many times that, perhaps as much as three times  that. We have not done a current evaluation,  so we are doing some enlightened guessing. Yet we are coming up with 14 billion barrels that is out there that we might be able to drill for and bring on board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me assure everyone that is no pittance. That is a lot. For some perspective, that is more oil than the United States has imported from the Persian Gulf in 15 years and more oil than we have gotten from the Gulf of Mexico in 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a plan to allow States to tap into those resources. The American people support that plan overwhelmingly. Why shouldn't we start there?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1998 to 2002, global demand rose by 4 million barrels per day. Since 2002, it has risen by 8 million barrels per day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In China, the number of cars on the road double every 5 years. The economy there is growing by 10 percent annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, through problems in places such as Nigeria, we have lost global supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be no surprise that prices have gone up. It is clear what this Senate needs to do about it: increase American production now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close by saying, the time has come to act on supply and demand. That means, as the American people are saying it: Start drilling on our property to produce oil and gas for our people instead of getting more and more from others overseas and actually sending all our wealth overseas, putting us in a ruinous situation, where we are growing poorer and poorer by the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from Virginia would like to speak.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Virginia is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a long history of supporting opening the OCS to drilling. Aside from being a longtime supporter of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, I have also engaged in attempts to open the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf Coasts to drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we were successful in opening a portion of the gulf, the Pacific and Atlantic coasts remain off limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of focusing my effort on all the off-limit portions of the OCS, I have concentrated over the last year on opening the coast of Virginia, for exploration of natural gas only. I think the history on this effort demonstrates a momentum shift in the minds of my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June 2007, I offered an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2007 that would allow for the exploration of natural gas in Virginia only. Extraction of natural gas could only occur if the Governor and State legislature approve such a move.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That vote lost by a vote of 44 nays and 43 yeas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of those 44 nays, there are two Senators who are now cosponsors of the Gas Price Reduction Act, a bill that includes a drilling title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the nonvoting Members, I think we could win this vote today, on an up-or-down vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fact is significant because it represents a shift in momentum and the way my colleagues are now thinking of rectifying this energy crisis in which our Nation finds itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague, whom I have been these 30 years sharing this floor with from time to time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have collaborated on so many things together.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>But now, as both of us are looking forward to quietly stepping down, I say to the Senator, you are carrying as full a weight as you ever did, and you are the man of the hour among our peer group to work on this energy question because of the depth and background you have on this subject.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, sir.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>So I commend you on your efforts with respect to drilling. But I wonder if you would bear with me a minute. Several years ago, I started on this, trying to drill offshore. Do you remember that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, sir, I do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>You always said to me, well, there will come a time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, sir.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>But I kept putting in bill after bill, and Senator Alexander joined me on one. And now--</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>The time is here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>The President has joined, and the time is here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the votes that were actually cast on my amendment at one time, where I lost by--it was actually 44 to 43--1 vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Or I would have received a majority vote at that time, notwithstanding the 60 votes required for passage, and we might be a little further down the road if that had happened.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>These people are gathered--I would say almost a quarter of Americans are gathered around the kitchen table every night looking at the increased costs in their food, the increased costs in their heating and their gasoline, trying to figure out how they are going to make ends meet,  with relatively small amounts of dollars in the overall picture. But to them, it is the difference between buying a little extra food and having the choice to forego it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, let me just say to my good friend from Rhode Island, I am sorry we have gotten a little bit behind. My remarks are not very long, and I will be happy to proceed on leader time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am happy the leader should proceed. I simply wished to have an idea of how long it might be so I know when I would begin.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, if I could make an inquiry of the distinguished leader while he is on the Senate floor, at some point I would like to work into the queue. If my good friend from Rhode Island is following the leader, perhaps I could follow him. Is there a standing order?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="GROUPED BY HOME STATE">
    <paragraph>If I could indicate to the Senator from Virginia, we are under an order that allocates the time of one-half-hour blocks, and I have our first Democratic half hour. So it would probably be more convenient and better, if the Senator simply followed the Republican leader, and I just deferred some additional time to allow him to speak directly after the Republican leader, and we can adjust the order accordingly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I appreciate that courtesy, and I will just take, say, 6 minutes following the distinguished Republican leader.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, my remarks are on another issue, but I was here for the colloquy between my good friend from Virginia and my equally good friend from New Mexico. We all know they are both retiring from the Senate later this year, but it is serendipitous that this issue has arisen at this particular time, when the American people are demanding the kind of action that the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Virginia have been promoting for years. So I think it  is a good thing that while they are still here in their service to our country, we will be debating this issue vigorously next week, and all of us hope for success.</paragraph>
