    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 14th annual National Public Lands Day, which will be celebrated on Saturday, September 29. I am pleased to acknowledge the efforts of volunteers around the Nation who will come together to improve and restore one of America's most valuable assets, our public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Public Lands Day has fostered communities of volunteers around the Nation. When it started in 1994, there were 700 volunteers working in only a few areas. This year nearly 110,000 volunteers will work at more than 1,300 locations to protect public land for the enjoyment of future generations. The spirit that guided the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1930s continues today in National Public Lands Day, our latest commitment to care for our country's natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has a grand tradition of conservation. When Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, it was the world's first national park. The idea of a national park was an American invention of historic proportions that led the way for global conservation efforts. One of the earliest and most energetic conservationists was President Teddy Roosevelt. He dedicated 194 million acres of national parks and national preserves, which set a lofty standard for all who follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over one-third of America is public land. They are places of continuous discovery, where we go to find ourselves, to uncover our history, and to explore for new resources. We are not the only ones to visit our public lands: millions of tourists, many from overseas, enjoy our national parks every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our public lands are part of who we are and their diversity reflects our identity. In many areas, they provide timber, ore, and forage that are the economic bedrock of rural America. In other areas, Congress has designated them as wilderness, places "untram-&#xD0;meled by man, where man is a visitor who does not remain."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize the thousands of Federal employees who manage these lands year-round. The Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and other Federal land management agencies ensure that public lands in Nevada meet the changing needs of our communities. They provide a vital, though rarely reported, service to our Nation, managing our public lands for our children and grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Public Lands Day encourages volunteers to join in that service. Across Nevada, at places like the Black Rock Desert, Lake Mead, Boundary Peak, Sloan Canyon and the Truckee River, volunteers will work to improve our public lands. This year's focus is the defense of native species from invasive weeds. Noxious weeds are a serious problem that has plagued the West for years. Exotic weeds push out native plants and provide plenty of fuel for wildfires. In Nevada, we know about this threat  all too well. National Public Lands Day volunteers in Elko, NV, will help to repair the damage from last year's record-setting fire season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The preservation of our public lands is a priority for me. Our public lands are part of what makes the United States a great Nation. I voice my gratitude to all who will participate in National Public Lands Day this year.</paragraph>
