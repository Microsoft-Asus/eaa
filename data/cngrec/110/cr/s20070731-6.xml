    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, following consultation with the Republican leader, may at any time proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 127, <bill type="s" number="849">S. 849</bill>, the Openness Promotes Effectiveness of Our National Government Act of 2007, sponsored by Senators Leahy and Cornyn, and that the bill be considered under the following limitations: that there be a time limit of 2 hours of general debate on the bill, with the time equally divided  and controlled between the chair and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee or their designees; that the only amendment in order be a Leahy-Cornyn technical amendment, which is at the desk; that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, with the above occurring without further intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will object, I believe it will be possible, with the sponsors of the bill, to reach an agreement that will obviate the necessity for a great deal of floor time or amendments on the floor. I have met with the sponsors of the bill and have presented ideas about ameliorating some of the deficiencies the Department of Justice brought out about the legislation. Last week, I had a long conversation with Senator Cornyn, who is here.  I believe if we can continue those discussions, in a very brief period of time--perhaps by the end of this week--it would not be necessary to devote a great deal of time to the consideration of the bill. Because of that, at this time, I will object to that particular procedure, but I hope we can report back to the majority leader that we have reached an agreement on the bill in the near future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would be satisfied if the junior Senator from Arizona could work on this. I hope there can be an agreement reached that we can take this bill up maybe when we get back, with a limited amount of time and amendments. It is very popular legislation--the Freedom of Information Act--which our friends in the press  love, and other organizations around the country. It is very important. I hope we can move forward on this bipartisan piece of legislation.</paragraph>
