  <narrative>LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13865]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. ALTMIRE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill passed by Congress reinvests in our Nation's future in a fiscally responsible way, and it is fully paid for with no deficit spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President vetoed this bill because he apparently believes that a better course of action would be to deliver massive cuts in critical domestic priorities, such as funding community health centers and medical research grants through the National Institutes of Health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Labor-HHS-Education bill vetoed by the President strengthens education by training 51,000 more teachers, and helps 173,000 more dislocated workers with job training and employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, unlike the budget-busting funding bills that were passed by previous Congresses and signed by this President, this bill is fully paid for and does not add one penny to the Federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we must override the President's veto and pass this fiscally responsible bill.</paragraph>
