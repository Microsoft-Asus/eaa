    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America can rightly claim to be the greatest military power. This status is due in no small part to our overwhelming supremacy in air and space. Air Force men and women have produced an unsurpassed record of achievement. Never before has our ability to project military power depended so heavily on air and space capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an Air Force veteran and cochairman of the House Air Force Caucus, I know firsthand how the Air Force provides our Nation a unique military advantage. However, what is most impressive is the dedication of the men and women of the United States Air Force who work hard every day to ensure air supremacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me leave you with the words of one of the Air Force founders, General Hap Arnold: "Air power will always be the business of every American citizen."</paragraph>
