    <paragraph>Mr. President, the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike G. Mullen, has made a statement to our American soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and their families. I was privileged to get a copy of this, and I think it is the type of letter every Member of the Senate should be allowed to read. So I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>To America's Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and your families, I am honored today to begin my term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As I do, allow me to thank you for your service at this critical time in our Nation's history.</narrative>
  <narrative>Whether you serve in Baghdad or Bagram, Kabul or Kuwait--whether you find yourself at sea in the Pacific, flying support missions over Europe, on the ground in Africa, or working every day at stateside bases--you are making a difference and so is every person in your family. Your service matters. And I do not take it for granted.</narrative>
  <narrative>The world is a dangerous place. The hundreds of thousands of you who have deployed since September 11th--many of you more than once--already know that. You've stood up to those dangers. You have lost friends to them. You may even have lost some of yourself to them. The dangers of this new and uncertain era have hit you and the people you love squarely in the gut. I will not lose sight of that.</narrative>
  <narrative>Nor should any of us lose sight of the need to continue serving. The enemies we face, from radical jihadists to regional powers with nuclear ambitions, directly and irrefutably threaten our vital national interests. They threaten our very way of life.</narrative>
  <narrative>You stand between these dangers and the American people. You are the sentinels of freedom. You signed up, took an oath, made a promise to defend something larger than yourselves. And then you went out and did it. I am grateful and honored, to be able to serve alongside you.</narrative>
  <narrative>The law says my main job is to advise the President, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council on issues of military readiness and capabilities. I will do that. But, I also see myself as your representative to those same leaders, an advocate for what matters to you and your families--your voice in the policies, programs, and processes that affect our National security. I will not forget the impact my decisions have on you.</narrative>
  <narrative>I will remember that you, too, comprise a great generation of patriots, and that among you are combat veterans with battlefield experience that many at my level have never and will never endure. I will tap that experience. I want to make sure we learn from it.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am not interested in planning to fight the last war, but neither am I interested in ignoring the valuable lessons we continue to learn from this one. It would be foolish to dismiss the knowledge you have gained. I will not do that.</narrative>
  <narrative>I know the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are taking a toll on you and your families. They are taking a toll on our equipment, our systems, and our ability to train as well. I worry, quite frankly, that they are taking a toll on our readiness for other threats in other places.</narrative>
  <narrative>But that does not mean our struggles there are not important. They most certainly are important. They are vital.</narrative>
  <narrative>To the degree the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contribute to or detract from a stable,  secure Middle East, they bear a direct effect on the security of the United States. That is why my number one priority will be developing a comprehensive strategy to defend our National interests in the region.</narrative>
  <narrative>Next on my list is resetting, reconstituting, and revitalizing our Armed Forces, especially the Army and Marine Corps. I believe our ground forces are the center of gravity for the all-volunteer force and that we need to make sure that force is correctly shaped and sized, trained, and equipped to defend the Nation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, I intend to properly balance global strategic risk. We must stay mindful of our many global security commitments and of the core warfighting capabilities, resources, and partnerships required to conduct operations across the full spectrum of peace and conflict. The demands of current operations, however great, should not dominate our training exercises, education curricula, and readiness programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan will one day end. We must be ready for who and what comes after.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is much to do. The speed of war, the pace of change, is too great for any of us to manage it alone. I need your help, your ideas, and your input. Whenever I travel to the field and to the fleet, I expect you to tell me what's on your mind. Tell me what you think. I need your constant feedback. I can't succeed--we can't succeed--without it.</narrative>
  <narrative>You made a promise to defend this country. Let me make one to you: I will listen to you. I will learn from you. And I will endeavor to lead always with your best interest at heart. The way I see it, that is my job now.</narrative>
  <narrative>M. G. Mullen,</narrative>
  <chair> The senior Senator from Florida.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to pick up on the earlier debate on the Sessions-Nelson amendment, No. 3141, that was offered by Senator Vitter, and just say I do not think this will be controversial because it is bringing the appropriations bill in conformance with exactly the provision that is in the Defense authorization bill on the Aegis BMD Program with an additional $75 million. This Aegis system has extraordinary effectiveness and promise, going after weapons, particularly  in the boost phase. It is a sea-based system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to explain what it does and why it is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate Armed Services Committee fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill that was recently adopted by the Senate, there is an authorization for an additional $75 million for the Aegis BMD program, in addition to authorizing the full budget request for the Aegis BMD program. That increased funding authorization came from our committee markup of the budget request, which was initiated in the subcommittee that handles missile defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the honor to serve as the chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, and I am pleased to have Senator SESSIONS as the ranking member of that subcommittee. For the Armed Services Committee markup of the Defense authorization bill, our Strategic Forces Subcommittee prepared a proposal for the portion of the defense budget within our jurisdiction, which includes ballistic missile defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subcommittee proposal included an additional $75 million for the Aegis BMD program, which was allocated as follows: $20 million for an increase in the production rate of the interceptor missile for the Aegis BMD system, known as the Standard Missile-3, or SM-3); $45 million for long lead of an additional 15 SM-3 interceptors; and $10 million to accelerate development of computer software for the Aegis system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment mirrors exactly the additional funding authorized by the Armed Services Committee, and approved by the Senate this last Monday. It recognizes that the Aegis BMD system provides an important capability against the existing threats by short- and medium-range ballistic missiles to our forward deployed forces overseas. It also recognizes that the President's budget request did not provide enough funds for this capability. So we are proposing to add more funding to build additional  near-term and effective capability against existing threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, when Senator SESSIONS was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, the subcommittee initiated legislation to make it U.S. policy that our priority in missile defense should be on effective near-term capabilities. That legislation was later enacted into law and is now our national policy. This amendment would take an important step to implement that policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Aegis BMD system has had an impressive development and testing program, with a commendable track record of successful and operationally realistic testing. I would note that the Navy is a critical component of the success of this system, since it has operated the Aegis weapon system and its standard missile variants for many years on its ships. The Navy has ensured that this missile defense capability works well with its existing systems and procedures, as is necessary to ensure the system  would work in real-world combat operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note that the Aegis BMD system is planned to improve its capability significantly over the coming years, especially with a larger and faster interceptor we are developing cooperatively with Japan. The improved version of the Aegis BMD system is expected to be able to defend against intermediate-range missiles and some long-range missiles, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment does what I believe the administration should have done. It would place greater emphasis and greater resources into an effective, near-term capability to defend our forward deployed forces, as well as our allies and friends overseas, against existing and near-term threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support for this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a couple of minutes of comment. I know Senator Kyl withdrew his amendment. But I do want to have the Record corrected, because I was listening to part of the debate when I was back in my office. I think it is important to have an accurate Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from Arizona indicated that the space-based test bed program which I oppose is not a program that would primarily be a space-based missile defense program.

    <paragraph>Let me read the unclassified portion of the Pentagon budget justification for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The space test bed is being explored as a potential solution to enhance ballistic missile defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess you can come to the floor and say: Well, that is not what it is. But you probably would have to ask the Pentagon to cut out this page from its budget justification book.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want the Record to reflect something that is half way accurate. All of us understand what that program was intended to be. This is what the Defense Department says it was intended to be. So when I come to the floor and talk about why this program ought not proceed, it is not authorized, it has not been funded in either the House or Senate appropriations bills and, besides, it is a program that will eventually weaponize space by putting ballistic missile defense interceptors in space,  I have the facts on my side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then to have someone say: Well, that is not what it was. Gosh, you must not understand it, Mr. Dorgan. Well, I am sorry; I do understand it. So does the Pentagon. They say again:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Space Test Bed is being explored as a potential solution to enhance ballistic missile defense capability in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went to a small school, but I can understand this. And I read fairly fast. There is not a lot of reading on this page. So I wanted the Record to reflect what is accurate about the issue of the space test bed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this country has an enormous responsibility with the question of nuclear weapons, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, attempting to find ways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles to protect this country in dozens of different ways against threats that exist against our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it would be a profound mistake for this Congress to decide, without authorization, with very little debate, to begin funding a program that eventually will provide weapons in space. We would be apoplectic if we believed a program existed or was begun today in the Duma or in China, because we would believe it would be a threatening approach for them to weaponize space. I think they would view the same with activities we would undertake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is we can work with others in the world with respect to nonproliferation and with respect to protecting all of us from those who would be aggressive in our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, my colleague suggested, because I said you can almost always find a general to support a program at the Pentagon--that I denigrated generals. My point was not to denigrate generals. But every program that exists, and every idea, has sponsors and support. You show me a program, I will show you a number of people who are involved in that program, believe in that program, and want that program to move. It is the generals and colonels and captains and lieutenants, and that is the way  the system works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I promised I was going to compliment the manager and the ranking member. I did it before, but let me do it again. This is a big piece of legislation, hard to put together, and not easy to manage. But they have been on the floor now for some while trying to move this legislation through. Much of it is very important for this country. I hope we can move to final passage in an expedited way.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have the floor, I understand my good friend, the Senator from New Jersey, is concerned. There appears not to be parity between the northern border and the southern border. I share his concern about some of the issues of racism that have been floated into the debate regarding our southern border. I think he would admit that there are differences between the northern border and the southern border. We are blessed to have friends on both our northern and southern borders. The failure of  the administration to take a truly bipartisan approach to comprehensive immigration reform and the failure of this body to go forward and work its way all the way through to a final immigration bill reflects some of the problems we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way to solve them is not to close the border to a historic neighbor on the longest unguarded frontier in the world, one of our largest trading partners. We already have policies of this administration that are about to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars in jobs in the United States, which do nothing to enhance our security, with the cockamamie idea from the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security requiring passports to cross between Canada and the United States. This  will do very little to improve our security. Instead of working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to find a way where we could have safe, easy transfer between the two countries, keep commerce going, especially after this administration has so badly handled our economy that our dollar has slipped dramatically, the administration wants to hastily implement ill-conceived barriers to cross-border travel. We seem to want to poke our thumb in the eye of a good neighbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not fault the Senator from New Jersey for his amendment. I understand the reason he does it. As he can well understand, I disagree with the idea of a fence along the Canadian border, just as I voted against erecting a fence along the southern border last year. I wish we could show some sense in real immigration policy with our southern border. It is a fault in this country to pretend we don't have illegal immigrants looking for a better life and to think that we are going to solve the problem  by denying them access to social programs, deny their children access to our schools, deny them access to assistance with food, deny them access to health care, and to threaten prosecution of our churches if they show their respect for the commandments and actually want to help the least among us.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the views of my distinguished colleague from Vermont. I particularly appreciate his support for comprehensive immigration reform for which he has been a champion. However, I must take the opportunity to note that the underlying amendment Senator Salazar and I were addressing, for which no point of order was raised against and which, in essence, was adopted by the Senate, goes to the very heart of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, there was a colloquy between Senator Tester and Senator Graham that basically said to some degree that, in fact, the resources Senator Graham had in his amendment, adopted by the Senate, could go to the northern border. What Senator Salazar and I want to make clear is that, in fact, either we protect all of the country or we protect none of it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am happy to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to make sure: The Senator would have been within his rights to have made a point of order against the Graham amendment had he wanted to; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I didn't have notice of it before it was called up for a vote; otherwise, I would have had the opportunity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>I had heard about an hour before the vote that we were having it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would note for the Senator, however, that his concern was in the underlying Graham amendment as well. So here we are, where we as a body consistently pursue one course of action on one part of the U.S. border, and on the other border we actually say it is quite different. The reality is, some of us on this issue believe there has to be some consistency because, if not, some of us believe either it is about securing the country or it is not. If it is about securing the country,  you can't secure one border and say the other border is free for people to cross undetected, as has been well documented by the Government Accountability Office, by the 9/11 Commission, and by the fact that the millennium bomber came through, and a host of other things. Either we are going to have security, which means north and south, or</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Senator, for one, intends to ensure moving forward that as we have other appropriations bills, I will make it my business to be on the Senate floor to raise points of order because either it is about securing all of the country or it is about securing none of it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President: I want to speak at this point with Senators Inouye and Stevens on the amendment offered by Senator Salazar and myself designating $5 million--the amount requested by the Pentagon and previously approved by the House--for the Missile Defense Space Experimentation Center, a facility within the Missile  Defense Integration and Operations Center on Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, CO. May  I ask, are the chairman and ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee aware of the potentially valuable work proposed for this center?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am as well, and I note that this amendment was submitted yesterday--coincidentally on the day when it became obvious that our Nation's missile defense system is, according to today's New York Times, "up and running."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Exactly. We hear frequent mention on this floor about the other, non-Iraq dangers facing this country, and our national missile defense system is designed to deal with some of the most worrisome of those threats--an accidental or rogue nation launch of ballistic nuclear weapons against our country. I am sure the chairman and ranking member agree on the value of this system, and that a system as technologically complex as this one requires constant analysis, demonstration, and integration?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Certainly.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>I further, then, suggest that the Missile Defense Space Experimentation Center fulfills this role, and also supports advanced technology and algorithm development, and other mission areas such as space situation awareness, technical intelligence, and battle space characterization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The MDSEC facility buildout began in fiscal year 2006 and continued through fiscal year 2007 under the STSS program. As the MDSEC supports multiple satellite operations and experiments, the fiscal year 2008 request of $5 million is contained within the MDA Space Program Element. The MDSEC provides the Missile Defense Agency a common support infrastructure and connectivity to the BMDS for the two satellites to be launched in 2008. It will also integrate space data in support of the missile defense  mission such as ongoing experiments using Defense Support Program data for missile defense, planned experiments with data from MDA and other defense and national security systems. MDSEC further supports mission integration of space-based missile track--boost and midcourse phases--sensor and weapons</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the mission and task for the MDSEC require our support and I urge the distinguished chairman and ranking member of this committee to give their full support to this program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>I pledge to my friend from Colorado that when we sit down to discuss this matter with the House I will continue to support the ballistic missile defense system.

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is unfortunate and sad, I think, that the Senate--and I would say the administration--has made a decision to prematurely draw down the National Guard presence at the southern border. That is an unwise event, and it signals uncertainty about our commitment to completing the lawful strategy we have for immigration at our border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not impossible for us to create a lawful system of immigration, but we have to do some things. We have allowed unlawfulness to continue for an extraordinary amount of time, to the extent that it is going to take us some effort now to reestablish a rule of law. But the whole world will be better off and everyone who wants to come to our country will be better off if they know what the rules are, how to apply, and have an understanding that their competitors who would like to come here are  not going to be allowed to come illegally and then be rewarded by amnesty while they wait in line to come lawfully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the amendment I have offered will fully fund Operation Jump Start at its original level--the 6,000 National Guard troops--through the end of fiscal year 2008. Currently, the Department of Defense has plans only to keep 3,000 at the border instead of the full 6,000 who were to be deployed through 2008. Furthermore, Operation Jump Start is actually now scheduled to end completely on July 1, 2008. So the increased funding provided for here--and I do believe it is an emergency and it is a legitimate  emergency expenditure to create lawfulness at our border, which will protect the national security of the United States--this increased funding will be needed to do these things: keep Operation Jump Start at the deployment level that has been so successful and keep Operation Jump Start running until this time next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 15, 2006, President Bush announced Operation Jump Start, which was the employment of up to 6,000 National Guard members to the southern land border. According to Operation Jump Start Year 1 Review, its intent was to provide:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An immediate means to enhance border enforcement operations while Border Patrol increased its own internal enforcement resources through hiring additional Border Patrol agents, mission support personnel, and procuring and applying new technology and infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OJS is providing interim support as Border Patrol recruits, hires, and trains 6,000 additional Border Patrol agents by the end of calendar year 2008--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>End of calendar year 2008; that is December of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would simply carry the strength of the National Guard through September 30, 2008, the fiscal year. That is important because we are facing a rather substantial drawdown without this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So deployments began on June 15, 2006, to give us a bit of a background. By August 2006, an average of 5,677 National Guard personnel were deployed. By June 2007--that is June of this year--an average of 5,759 were deployed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning, on the border, the National Guard has supported the Department of Homeland Security by providing, among other things, the following skills: construction of tactical infrastructure; that is, fencing, roads, and lighting and those kinds of things that are really critical if we are serious about making sure people just don't walk across our border. You have to have those things. We made some progress in that regard, although, in truth, we should have made more. They are involved  in fence repair, welding, and facility maintenance. Many of these are engineer Guard units with a lot of capabilities in this area. They provide vehicle and fleet maintenance. Many of these are transportation units that are skilled at fleet maintenance. Entry identification teams, surveillance and reconnaissance teams, law enforcement communication assistance, intelligence analysis--we have a lot of those capabilities in the National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would say they are not being utilized on a daily basis to patrol the border and make arrests. We decided that would not be what they are deployed for. But they are really providing a lot of capability that frees up a limited number of Border Patrol agents to be the front-line troops, to go out and make the arrests and do the day-to-day work that has to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the operation is undeniable. By early December of 2006, just 6 months after the deployment began, Robert Gilbert, the chief Border Patrol agent for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jointly, we are making a definite impact on the border. The professionalism and dedication and training the Guard units have brought to our mission and our fight, the way they have made it their mission and their fight, is more than we expected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That same month, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, LTG Steve Blum, stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was here 2 1/2  months ago and things that I didn't think would be possible in a year have already been accomplished. Infrastructure is up, fencing is up, roads are built, lighting is up, and apprehensions are down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those aren't just words. The success of Operation Jump Start is tangible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Year 1 Review:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Force multiplication has allowed more Border Patrol agents to remain in the enforcement mode, not the support mode. The additional manpower has allowed DHS to return 563 agents to frontline positions. The result is referred to as "badges back to the border."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Guard presence has added 337 miles of expanded border surveillance capabilities along the southwest border. Guard personnel provide 6,500 hours of camera monitoring. Somebody has to monitor the cameras. There is no doubt that an electronic fence, as some have said, is not a worthless idea. You can use cameras and electronic technology to enhance our capabilities at the border, but in the high-traffic areas, it is not a question of seeing people, it is a question of how you can detain them  if they are coming illegally. So I think we made progress there with the help of the National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guard personnel have assisted in apprehending more than 10 percent of the aliens apprehended during the past year--a total of 84,878 apprehensions. Overall, apprehensions of illegal immigrants trying to cross the border are down by 25 percent. What most experts conclude that means is that an estimated 25 percent fewer illegal immigrants are attempting to cross. The Guard's presence is, in fact, having a deterrent effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the help of the National Guard, marijuana seizures are up 22 percent. The Guard was responsible for seizing 201,000 pounds of marijuana at the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, when we talk about security and the need to do something about openness and illegality at our border, we have to consider drugs to be a big part of that. Guard personnel have assisted in the seizure of 4,783 pounds of cocaine, 703 vehicles, and $60,000 in currency. So this is an important matter in the success we are having.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Guard presence has produced sizable gains in critically needed tactical infrastructure along the border. They have already repaired 428 miles of roads. You have to have roads if you are going to be effective in maintaining a border. And 16 miles of all-weather roads have been repaired and maintained. They have installed 58 miles of vehicle barriers. At least it prohibits people from driving into our country loaded with drugs or illegal items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have constructed 18.2 miles of fencing, which is a disappointing number. After all that we funded in this Congress, which was 700 miles of fencing, we have only 18 miles completed.  We voted for it. We talked about it. We go back home and tell our constituents we have done it. The President says we are doing it. The Secretary of Homeland Security says we are doing it. We have not accomplished much, but the Guard has played a role by using their  engineering capability. Frankly, if they had been focused more on actual barriers, they probably would have accomplished more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real reason is the way we planned this out has been very slow in development, in terms of building our fencing. In fact, we are informed that the fencing numbers are improving right now; that miles of fencing are appearing and coming much more rapidly on line than before. If you examine the situation closely, you will see there appears to be a move afoot to draw this out and end up with far less fencing than the Congress contemplated both with our authorization and appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security indicates that the Guard's presence will have an even greater impact on tactical infrastructure over the next year:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The deployments will be focused on providing a greater residual value by raising the percentage of troops that are working on tactical infrastructure projects. This infrastructure will greatly enhance the ability of the men and women of the border patrol to access the border and be more effective in the enforcement efforts for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OK. What they are saying is they have projected in the coming months that the Guard is going to be even more effective because they will be providing a greater residual value by raising the percentage of troops working on infrastructure projects. Now, there are people who don't want infrastructure at the border, and they would like to bring the troops home, I suppose, before that happens. That would be a big mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard is helping the border to save lives. In the last year, they have rescued 91 people--illegal aliens--in the area who were in desperate trouble for lack of water or being lost. They rescued them. Now, this is what has happened. Despite the proven success of the program, the operation is scheduled to stop by next July. Troops are already being reduced. By the end of July, troops were down to 4,500; that is July of 2007. By the end of August of this year, troops were down to 3,500.  So it dropped even more. Today, only 3,000 personnel are on Operation Jump Start orders, and, of those, only 2,300 are actually at the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So already there has been a drawdown of more than half of the National Guard personnel, and not communicating that to the American people is leaving us in a difficult situation, I suggest. The National Guard was supposed to fill the gap until 6,000 new Border Patrol agents could be recruited, hired, trained, and stationed at the border. That goal has only been accomplished halfway. Only 3,000 new agents have joined the 1,000 who were on the border when President Bush announced Operation Jump  Start. The National Guard is assisting in fence and other critical infrastructure construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secure Fence Act that we passed mandated that the Department of Homeland Security construct more than 700 miles of new fencing. The administration's goal apparently is not to do that. Apparently it is to just complete 300 miles by the end of the whole next year, 2008. So with 2 years of authorization and funding, they will have only completed less than half of the fencing. To date, only 70 new miles have been constructed, for a total of 145 miles of fencing on the border. That is not the  kind of signal we need to be sending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason that is important is because it has a psychological impact, as well as an actual apprehension impact. What about alien apprehensions? To date, alien apprehensions on the border are down 25 percent. While this is positive, because it indicates the attempts at crossings are likely down by 25 percent as well, the job is certainly not finished. The year before that, we arrested 1 million people at the border. Can you imagine that? One million people were arrested at the border. It is not  an exaggeration to say that it is a wide-open, lawless area that needs attention from our Government. If we don't give it, we are breaking faith with the American people because we have said we are going to fix that, we are going to do something about it. We just haven't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to tell you there are some people who really don't care about it. They talk about it, but they don't care. We have some progress; 25 percent is a lot. It is not insignificant. But if we really got that fencing up and built, if we kept the National Guard down at the border, if we broaden the Border Patrol and motivate them to be as effective as they possibly could be, I absolutely believe--absolutely believe--we can reach a tipping point where the whole world begins to say the border of  the United States is no longer wide open; that you can get in trouble going across there. Most people are getting caught. It is an entirely different place, so maybe we better not try it this time. Maybe somebody suggested we can do that, but that is not a good idea. But for the last 20 years-plus, it has been a well-known fact worldwide that you can just walk across our border, if you have very much initiative, and be successful at it. If they catch you, nothing ever happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I will conclude by noting that, according to the year review of Operation Jump Start:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OJS is one of the many enforcement initiatives employed to expand enforcement capabilities to gain better operational control along the Southwest border. OJS, combined with other initiatives, such as Operation Streamline, Zero Tolerance, Arizona Border Control Initiative, and the Expedited Removal Program, has resulted  in a cumulative, positive impact on current levels of border control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good news. A positive impact. What it should do is give us encouragement. If we will just follow through, expand what we are doing, adjust to the changing tactics of those who want to enter illegally, and do it with will and determination and a positive attitude, we can make a difference. We can end this open border, end the illegality that has made the immigration system a mockery of law and an embarrassment to our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Jump Start is a proven success. It is a critical component of our strategy. Guardsmen are filling critical law enforcement roles. They are building fencing and infrastructure and interdicting narcotics and conducting surveillance and reconnaissance; and, by the way, a substantial majority of our cocaine and methamphetamines, for that matter, are coming into our country through Mexico. I talk to law enforcement officers in Alabama all the time. They say we used to get a lot out of Miami  and south Florida. Now it is all coming across the Mexican border. So we have a law enforcement interest in this also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason Operation Jump Start should end this June. At a minimum, it should be extended until all 6,000 Border Patrol agents are on duty. The way we have been going, we authorize it and say we are going to add 6,000 Border Patrol agents, and they don't get added, if you want to know the truth. We have seen that happen time and time again. They said we were going to continue this Operation Jump Start and the National Guard, but we have already reduced our Guard personnel by more than  half. That adds credibility problems with the American people. No wonder they are suspicious about what we are doing here. This amendment will provide the needed funding to keep Operation Jump Start at its original capacity, 6,000 Guard personnel, instead of what they have planned now. It makes no sense to the American people to say</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, to sum up, the good news is we have made some progress, but we have not really begun to get to finishing up. If we get the fencing up and keep our Guard there full-time and get our new Border Patrol agents up and we move to ending the catch-and-release and adopt the Texas plan, where individuals are prosecuted for violating the laws by entering illegally--that has reduced border crossings in that area by 45 percent or more--and if we can do other things  like  that, this will work and we can make good progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, I think some are not desirous of us being successful. Everything that tends to work seems to be delayed and slowed down and undermined. If we move forward, we can send a message to the world that our National Guard is there, our troops are there, the Border Patrol has been increased, we are building barriers, and you are not going to get in easily anymore, so you better wait in line and come here lawfully, and the whole country will be better off. This amendment will be a big  part of doing that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to discuss the need to continue development of a vital next-generation battlefield surveillance and management radar system. Battlefield surveillance and management is more important than ever for the safety and effectiveness of our military, engaged in a variety of combat operations. With the advent of increasingly difficult-to-track targets, new technology is critically important to keep pace with expanding threats to our men and women in uniform. Indeed,  U.S. technology should be honed to detect threats such as cruise missiles, rockets, as well as slow moving land based targets common on the battlefield in counterterrorism operations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee knows, production of the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar aircraft, or JSTARS--our Nation's principal platform for performing these vital missions--was canceled in 2003, with its last delivery occurring in 2005. The E-10 multisensor command and control aircraft was intended to replace this platform, but that too was canceled last year. Fortunately, after constructive discussions with the Department of  Defense, the Pentagon agreed to continue developing the high-tech sensor and radar technologies that were being designed to outfit the E-10, the multiplatform radar technology insertion program, or MP-RTIP. Unfortunately, the Department of Defense would only commit to developing the system via supplemental</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="BATTLEFIELD SURVEILLANCE AND MANAGEMENT RADAR SYSTEM">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for bringing up this critical matter. The threats that our troops face on the battlefield continue to grow. We, and they, are fortunate that they have JSTARS and its radar to give them a critical edge. JSTARS has proven its value on the battlefield many times, beginning with Desert Storm when it was rushed to the field to give our commanders an unprecedented view of the battlefield. Since then, every warfighting commander that has testified before us has said  that JSTARS is absolutely essential to success. Indeed, as the senior Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, the cancellation of the E-10 means that JSTARS will remain essential for years to come. But the radar on JSTARS is aging at the same time that the battlefield is getting more complex and threats harder to detect. Fortunately, MP-RTIP can be available to put on JSTARS. I believe we must move quickly to develop a version of MP-RTIP and install it on our JSTARS aircraft to give our commanders</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to add to my distinguished colleague from Connecticut's remarks. While our troops deserve nothing less than the best equipment, it is also essential that we maintain the ability to domestically produce this type of advanced technology. I am convinced that failure to support MP-RTIPs continued advancement would result in a devastating loss to our domestic industrial base, essential for producing this type of crucial radar technology. Additionally, it would seem as though  we had wasted the $1 billion already invested in this vital program. Now is not the time to forgo dominance in the realm of battlefield surveillance and management--and that is precisely what would happen if we ended domestic production of this vital system.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, on Patriot missiles. It is my understanding that the Patriot missile is the Army's only fielded air and missile defense capability. With only 13 total deployable battalions in the force, the Army operational and personnel capacity to respond to the needs of the combatant commanders is severely stressed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="PATRIOT MISSILES">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue. As the Senator knows, I am a strong supporter of the Patriot.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="PATRIOT MISSILES">
    <paragraph>Your support is well known and very much appreciated. This year is a very active year for Patriot--the Patriot pure fleet effort will upgrade three tactical battalions from the PAC-2 to the PAC-3 configuration and the Patriot "Grow the Army" effort to upgrade two nontactical battalions of Patriot equipment from the PAC-2 to the PAC-3 configuration, and purchase the remaining new equipment for stand-up of these battalions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that the funding for this effort is a little complicated. The Army requested $208 for the Patriot pure fleet effort and $294 million in the amended fiscal year 2008 President's budget request to fund the activation and equipping of the first additional battalion fiscal year 2008 with the second in fiscal year 2010. This fiscal year 2008 funding is critical to this schedule to procure long lead materials to prevent slip into fiscal year 2012 and beyond. I understand that  providing these funds in fiscal year 2008 avoids almost $100 million in costs. And if that funding is provided, the plan for Patriot pure fleet and the "Grow the Army" initiative is executable and not ahead of the need to establish the two additional battalions. I believe that fully funding the Army's amended request in fiscal year 2008 is in the best interests of the taxpayer and will avoid almost $100 million in costs if the Army can award all this work under one contract.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the esteemed Senator from Hawaii in order to speak about the important role medium to high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, play in operations across the world today. We are concerned that the DOD is simply not fielding enough of these systems. Despite constant increases in procurement and assurance from the Department that they are working to address this requirement, medium to high altitude UAVs remain a low density high  demand asset.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Indiana for raising this important issue and agree with my good friend that improving our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities is a critical issue for our military today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE">
    <paragraph>As my chairman is already fully aware, today's counterinsurgency and counterterror operations remain intelligence driven. The ultimate success of so many of our military's missions depends on the effectiveness of our intelligence capabilities. Truly, each and every single operation has an intelligence component.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not believe that these assets can ever replace people or the human intelligence they produce, but they remain highly valuable given their limited footprint and ability to collect data across multiple spectrums. Simply put, they are force multipliers. Systems like the Predator, Reaper, and Sky Warrior have long loiter times and an ability to strike immediately. Further, they do not have to wait on the arrival of other manned assets before engaging a target, which is something that we cannot  currently duplicate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have visited Iraq and Afghanistan, where I was told over and again the importance of these ISR assets. Further, during a recent Armed Services hearing, I was able to question our new Special Operations Commander, Admiral Olson, about medium to high altitude UAV requirements. He told the committee that there is currently a 30 UAV orbit requirement in CENTCOM. However, we only have 12 orbits available today. I find this unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In both major theaters of operation, we have been told how difficult it can be to have constant surveillance of suspected enemy hideouts. Given that insurgents are nearly always local, these hideouts and safe havens can often be in the midst of innocent bystanders and be difficult to observe covertly. Having eyes on a site to provide the target discrimination our commanders need is invaluable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter how long American forces remain in either theater, I strongly believe that some of the last assets to leave will be ISR collection in nature. Medium to high altitude UAVs do just that, and I ask that my colleague from Hawaii look to address this significant shortfall in the upcoming fiscal year 2008 supplemental appropriations bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to enter into a colloquy with my friend from Hawaii, the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Inouye.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us includes two significant cuts to the President's budget request in the area of Army research and development on combat vehicle and automotive technology. The House-passed version of this bill and both the House and Senate-passed versions of the National Defense Authorization Act do not include these cuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first cut of $10 million eliminated funding for a fuel efficiency ground vehicle demonstrator, FED. This program is scheduled to be a 3-year effort by the ground vehicle experts at the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center to develop a tactical ground vehicle that is significantly lighter and more fuel efficient than current high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles, HMMWVs. Specifically, this program will focus on the overall design of the vehicle as well  as components including hybrid electric propulsion systems, fuel cells, advanced batteries, and new armor solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project is key to advancing technologies that will allow the Department of Defense to meet the fuel efficiency goals it has established. Additionally, this project is complementary to the development of the new joint light tactical vehicle and will provide an opportunity to demonstrate a number of new technologies, including on-board power solutions, that can  be spun into the vehicle as its development moves forward. Lastly, this project provides  the opportunity to test technologies that will give our military new capabilities, including silent overwatch and mobile power sources on the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second cut of $14.215 million eliminated funding for future combat systems, FCS, science and technology activities in the area of robotics. FCS is the Army's only major transformation project, and we must remain committed to this program. These funds would be used to support the development of electronics and control systems for unmanned ground vehicles that will eventually be integrated into the FCS network. Without these funds, the Army will not have the ability to build a large scale unmanned  ground vehicle demonstrator to test new robotics technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These funds are critical to advancing and testing new robotics technologies so they can be rapidly deployed to our warfighters around the world. Cutting these funds will reduce the Army's ability to develop and test robotics technologies needed by our troops and increase the risk that they will not be available for rapid transition into the hands of warfighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure my colleague would agree that we should do more, not less, to achieve increased fuel efficiency in our military ground vehicles and more rapidly mature the capabilities of unmanned ground vehicle technologies.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="ARMY R &amp; D--FED">
    <paragraph>My colleague from Michigan raises some important points. Reducing fuel consumption in the field is an urgent need of our military. It will not only reduce costs but also reduce the risk to our troops because fewer fuel deliveries will need to be made to dangerous areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also agree that future combat systems, and especially the new robotics technologies it will bring, are critically important to our troops. These technologies will continue to play an important role in the transition of our military to a more mobile, lethal, and effective force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commit to my colleague from Michigan that the committee will reevaluate the cuts he has highlighted when the bill goes to conference with the House.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to offer for the Record, the Budget Committee's official scoring of <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill>, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, provides $459.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2008, which will result in new outlays of $312.2 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the bill will total $476 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate-reported bill is at its section 302(b) allocation for budget authority and $3 million below its allocation for outlays. No points of order lie against the committee-reported bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="ARMY R &amp; D--FED">
    <paragraph>Madam President, the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is one of the most important of the appropriations measures that we will consider this year. This legislation will provide critical funding for the men and women in our Armed Forces who, at this very moment, are in harm's way. Because we must continue to support them, I support the passage of this bill, but I have serious concerns over the earmarks contained in the committee report accompanying this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill reported out of committee appropriates over $448 billion. This is more than $3.5 billion below the President's request and, notably, does not include any additional funds for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As is the case with so many of the appropriations bills that come to the floor, the report accompanying it contains numerous earmarks that were neither requested nor authorized, to the tune of over $5 billion. During a time of war, we should be making every effort to support  the President's budget request instead of slashing it and then adding earmarks for favored projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day, we ask the brave men and women who fight for freedom on behalf of our great Nation, and their families, to make sacrifices. They sacrifice in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere throughout the globe. We in the Congress should exercise some degree of self-restraint and sacrifice, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me mention a few of the add-ons that were included in the bill's accompanying report: $2 million for a project involving brown tree snakes; a total of $3 million for an electronic futures trading program; $2 million for research on high-pressure microwave processing for meals-ready-to-eat; $2 million for the Marines to buy boot socks cushioned with merino wool; $2 million to buy extended cold-weather gloves for the Army; $2 million for research on a technology that extracts pure water from  the air; $2 million for research on a multispectral fingerprint device; $4 million to study the Northern Lights; $6.5 million for small instrument development for Magdalena Ridge Observatory; and $10 million for Eielson Utilidors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, there are also many earmarks that may be for worthy causes, but there is no compelling national defense reason for these items to be funded through this legislation. These earmarks include $150 million for a peer-reviewed breast cancer research program; $80 million for a similar prostate cancer research program; $10 million for ovarian cancer research; $27.5 million for the Hawaii Federal Health Care Network; $10 million to a program called Ceros, for river and oceanic research; $6.1  million for research on a new engine called homopolar hybrid drive; $2 million for research into putting humans into a state similar to hibernation so they can be kept alive long enough for doctors to administer treatments; and $3 million for research for a 2D-3D face-recognition system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we are engaged fully in the global war on terror, it is imperative that we get the most out of each and every defense dollar. The money that is being diverted to projects like the ones I have mentioned could instead be used for body armor or other critical needs to protect our troops and help win the war on terror. The earmarks I have mentioned are just a small sampling of the many unrequested earmarks that fill the accompanying report. These earmarks are draining our precious resources and  are not vital to our long-term national security. I strongly encourage the Federal agencies affected to use their judgement to ensure they are not allocating resources to projects that are not legislatively mandated or authorized but rather, are merely the wish lists of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the report accompanying the bill, there are several authorizing provisions, which by their nature have no place in an appropriations vehicle, including language directing the Air Force to provide funding to continue the operation of the 36th Rescue Flight assigned to Fairchild AFB in Washington State and a provision requiring funding for Naval archeology programs in the Lake Champlain Basin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, in the bill, a provision directs the Air Force to complete upgrades and additions to Alaskan range infrastructure and training areas, as well as at Hickman AFB in Hawaii. A similar provision calls for $3 million to be spent on upgrades and maintenance at the Pacific Missile Range Facility. Another provision prohibits the disestablishment of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of these authorizing provisions are outside of the scope of defense policy, including language providing for the Navy to transfer up to $20 million  to the Interior Department for any expenses associated with the construction of the USS Arizona Memorial Museum and Visitors Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to discuss the "Buy America" restrictions that cost the Department of Defense and the American taxpayers. Like in previous appropriations bills, this year's bill imposes a number of "Buy America" restrictions. For example, the bill would prevent the Defense Department's purchase of particular welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain; carbon alloy or armor steel plate; ball and roller bearings, unless they are manufactured in the United States. It would put similar restrictions  on the Department's buying public vessels, food, certain textile materials, particular Navy supply ships, as well as its purchase of coal as a fuel source for certain military installations in Germany. Another "Buy America" provision prohibits the Department's buying any supercomputer that is not manufactured in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to be very concerned about the potential impact on readiness of our restrictive trade policies with our allies. From a philosophical point of view, I oppose these types of policies as protectionist. I believe free trade is an important element in improving relations among all nations and essential to economic growth. From a practical standpoint, "Buy America" restrictions, such as those contained in this bill, could seriously impair our ability to compete freely in international  markets and also could result in the loss of existing business from long-standing trade partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no doubt that some of these provisions may be important while others are questionable at best. What is important is that we follow the authorization process and restrain ourselves from using appropriations bills to authorize projects on this bill that have not been requested by the Department of Defense, nor approved by the authorizing committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there can be no doubt that this legislation is very important to the ultimate success of our ongoing war on terror. Yet I believe it is important to point out to the American taxpayer where some of their money is going and some of it is not going to projects that have anything to do with our defense.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="ARMY R &amp; D--FED">
    <paragraph>Madam. President, I rise today to express my support for <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill>, the fiscal year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. We have no greater obligation as elected officials, than to take care of our troops and their families who have sacrificed on our behalf. I am proud to support my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee who have crafted a bill that sets the right priorities for our military and our country by providing critical equipment and training, strengthening  military health care for our troops and their families, and giving our military families the pay raise they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today provides over $1 billion more for National Guard equipment than the administration requested. This funding is critical, not only to support National Guard troops who are fighting for our country overseas but to the Guard's ability to protect us here at home. National Guard units across the country have been giving up the great majority of their equipment to units headed to Iraq and Afghanistan. The resulting shortages were felt just recently in Greenburg, KS, when  that town was flattened by a tornado. Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius said the State's response was hampered because much of the equipment usually positioned around the State to respond to emergencies was in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Maryland does not face the same threat of tornadoes, my home State, like every State, has its own unique challenges. Maryland must be prepared to respond not only to hurricanes and severe snow storms but to attacks against Federal assets in the national capital region. After the mobilization of several Maryland Guard units to Iraq, the Guard has said it is without the necessary equipment to provide the robust response that Marylanders and the rest of our Nation expect. <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill> takes action  to address this critical shortfall in my State and every State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important bill provides military personnel 3.5 percent pay raise, half a percent more than the administration requested. President Bush has threatened to veto this bill over the 0.5 percent additional increase stating that the "[t]roops don't need bigger pay raises." Well, I disagree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 3 percent raise would be enough to keep pace with the average increase in private sector wages last year. The 3.5 percent raise is enough to not just match the private sector but to slightly close the estimated 4 percent gap that remains between average military and private sector raises. This gap hurts recruiting and retention for our All-Volunteer Force and is not a handicap our military should shoulder when the war effort has forced the military to increase its overall size at the same  time it has depressed recruiting efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill> makes care for our mentally and physically wounded military men and women a priority. The legislation adds $948.9 million above the President's request for military health care, totaling $23.5 billion. Of the $23.5 billion, $486 million was added to reverse planned cuts to military hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill> provides significant funds to develop treatments for the signature injuries of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan including brain injury and loss of limbs. Uncontrolled internal or external hemorrhage is the foremost preventable cause of death in the prehospital period for military combat trauma. Some 50 percent of the deaths our troops have suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan could have been prevented if better products were available to control bleeding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure provides $73 million to fund programs authorized in the Senate-passed Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warrior Act. The Wounded Warriors bill addresses the urgent medical needs of wounded servicemembers, especially those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly proud that <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill> funds promising techniques being pioneered in Maryland to develop bandages that are capable of stopping severe bleeding in the field and limb and tissue transplants that are viable over the many years we hope our young wounded warriors will live after returning home from war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill> places a premium not only on providing our troops the equipment they need to avoid injury in the first place but to develop better technology going forward. The legislation provides $75.4 billion, $268.9 million above the administration's request for research, development, test, and evaluation of new technologies. Some money will go to folks in Maryland developing methods of detecting explosives at a greater distance as well as hybrid and alternative fuel source engines. These engines  not only reduce our dependence on oil and decrease emissions; they reduce the need to ship fuel along supply routes in Iraq and Afghanistan that have been a point of vulnerability for our forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am proud to be part of a body that is meeting its obligations to our troops, their families, and our military as an institution. I applaud Senators BYRD, COCHRAN, INOUYE, and STEVENS and my other colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their excellent work and look forward to quick passage of this critical legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to take a moment to say that my wife and I watched closely Ken Burns' production of "The War" or, as Katharine Phillips Singer from Mobile,  called it, "The Wah." Some of the people we know there have enjoyed and been so impressed with the remarks of Senator Inouye as he was interviewed about his experiences during World War II. His heroism and commitment to America was demonstrated in so many different  ways in that program. He spoke so eloquently and so insightfully about the nature of war, the difficulty and brutality of war. I think not only did he affirm the courageousness of our soldiers, but he gives us cause to look for ways to avoid such events in the future. It is worth noting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully, that whole production will be seen around the country and more people will get a better picture of the enormity, the breadth, the commitment our Nation gave during that decisive period in our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Stevens also, of course, was a person who served courageously in that conflict. It is an honor for me today to be with these two fine patriots as we apparently move to final passage of this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I was pleased to support the fiscal year 2008 Defense Appropriations Act. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my good friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens for their leadership in managing this bill with such impartiality and expediency. Not only does this bill fully support the facility, training and equipment requirements of our men and women in uniform, but it  also provides a much needed increase in funds for military health over the President's budget request to ensure that members of our Armed Forces receive the care that they deserve. As chairman of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, I strongly supported the additional inclusion of $73 million to fund the programs authorized in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warrior Act which addresses shortfalls in the care provided to our injured or ill soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also applaud the inclusion in this bill of a provision which recognizes the dedication and sacrifices made by both the members of our Armed Forces and their civilian counterparts by providing a 3.5 percent increase in basic pay for all servicemembers and civilian personnel, a 0.5 percent increase above the President's request. I was also pleased to support the addition of $1 billion to properly equip the National Guard and Reserve forces who risk their lives to defend our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this bill moves toward conference I will continue to work with my colleagues in both the Senate and the House to ensure that our military members and their families have the resources they need and the support they have earned.</paragraph>
