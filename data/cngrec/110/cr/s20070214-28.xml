    <paragraph>Madam President, I wanted to take this opportunity to say a few words about my close friend and colleague who passed away yesterday, Congressman CHARLIE NORWOOD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that with the death of CHARLIE NORWOOD the State of Georgia has lost one of her favorite sons. We were elected to serve in the House of Representatives the same year and represented adjoining districts in Georgia and South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHARLIE was a dear friend of mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have never met anyone in politics with more passion about what they believe than CHARLIE NORWOOD. He was a great representative for the people for the people of the 10th district of Georgia, and in his years of service he made a real difference in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt CHARLIE's leadership, his wisdom, and his wit will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time to keep CHARLIE's family in our prayers. But we should also celebrate a life well-lived. Knowing CHARLIE NORWOOD like I do, I am confident he would not have wanted it any other way.</paragraph>
