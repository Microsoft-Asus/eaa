    <paragraph>Mr. President, in short, we are going to be in late tomorrow. We hope to finish this bill Wednesday by the time we recess for the Jewish holiday. We tried to clear a few nominations tonight, but there were some objections on the Republican side. We hope to get those cleared for the President tomorrow.</paragraph>
