    <paragraph>Madam President, the night is late. Morning is fast approaching. I appreciate everyone's cooperation. We are going to be in a series of pro forma sessions and likely we will be doing no more work until we come back after the reconvening of the new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate everyone's work over the past many hours. I have already given my remarks. I only say that I would hope the President, who has worked so well with us the past few weeks on this legislation, would now consider using TARP money to help the auto industry and the workers of this country. Any conditions that were proposed by all Senators--Senator Corker, Senator Dodd; anything they wanted to put in there, they could do anything they wanted. I would hope they would consider  that and do it as early as tomorrow.</paragraph>
