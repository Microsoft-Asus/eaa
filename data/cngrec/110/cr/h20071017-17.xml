    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when we talk with our constituents, we are constantly hearing over and over, protect our freedoms, make certain that America is secure. Making certain that our homeland is secure is something that comes to the forefront this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat RESTORE Act does fall short. It falls short of what is needed to give our intelligence community the effective tools they need to detect and prevent terrorist activities. That is what we want to do, prevent it. This bill would restrict the intelligence community, and in many cases it gives the appearance of favoring those who do not have our best interests at heart. Is that a message that we would seek to send? Our intelligence community deserves the full resources of the Federal  Government, not the red tape of a typical bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we agree that proper oversight is necessary, oversight should never prohibit the men and women in the intelligence community from doing their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my Democrat colleagues to reconsider their support for the RESTORE Act.</paragraph>
