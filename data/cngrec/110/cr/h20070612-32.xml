Con. Res. 164</bill>) authorizing the use of the rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the concurrent resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support <bill type="hc" number="164">H. Con. Res. 164</bill>, which authorizes use of the rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through a lifetime of research and development aimed at curing world hunger, Dr. Borlaug has exemplified how science and humanitarianism can intersect to address the needs of developing countries that have been ravaged by the effects of hunger and poverty. By introducing high-yield, disease-resistant varieties of wheat to India, Mexico and Pakistan, Dr. Borlaug developed sustainable, renewable food sources that are frequently estimated to have saved over a billion lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The results of Dr. Borlaug's research were remarkable, yet not surprising given the commitment of this man of science to find practical, applicable solutions to the world's problems, not, as he put it, chase academic butterflies. Dr. Borlaug's efforts to apply science to stimulate agricultural yield have been frequently credited as being a major milestone of the Green Revolution, and he himself has often been cited as the father of that movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1970, Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in India and Pakistan, and for his role in the Green Revolution. When he was advised in October of that year that he had won the enormous honor, Dr. Borlaug was where he spent many of his hours--in the farm fields of Mexico. When his wife drove an hour to reach him in the fields and advise him that the media was waiting for his reaction, Dr. Borlaug declined to return to the house, saying that he and his assistants still had  much more work to do, as he continued to record data on his test plots. It was there that the TV camera crews found him 2 hours later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the Nobel Prize, Dr. Borlaug has been recognized with the 1977 U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 2002 Public  Welfare Medal from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the 2002 Rotary International Award for World Understanding and Peace, and the 2004 National Medal of Science. He has also received numerous honorary degrees from around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though he has received many accolades, Dr. Borlaug has been quick to point out that his work alone will not be enough to cure world hunger. In 1986, Dr. Borlaug created the World Food Prize, an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by continuing to improve the quality, quantity and availability of food in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to support <bill type="hc" number="164">H. Con. Res. 164</bill> to authorize use of the Capitol rotunda to honor Dr. Norman E. Borlaug as he receives the Congressional Gold Medal. It is fitting that such an honor be bestowed upon a man who has done so much, for so many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concurrent resolution was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
