    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="hr" number="1202">H. Res. 1202</bill> which supports the goals and ideals of National Guard Youth Challenge Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1202">H. Res. 1202</bill> was introduced by our colleague and ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) on May 15, 2008. This resolution was considered by and reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on July 16, 2008, by voice vote and has the support and cosponsorship of 62 Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America today, we are facing an epidemic of young men and women dropping out of high school. Even with programs like GEAR UP, each year we continue to see that nearly a million and a quarter students fail to graduate from high school, and that there are approximately 33 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 who have not earned their high school degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These facts help to highlight the importance of recognizing the efforts and achievements of the National Guard Youth Challenge Program. The National Guard Youth Challenge Program strives to improve the education, life skills, and employment potential of America's high school dropouts through public awareness, scholarships, higher education assistance, mentoring, and job development programs. The program can be found in 28 States as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia and at each  site you can find a difference being made in the lives of so many deserving young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since it began in 1993, the National Guard Youth Challenge Program has assisted over 75,000 students. The success rate is astounding: 80 percent earn their high school diplomas or GED, 26 percent enter college, 18 percent enter the military, and 56 percent join the workforce in career jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Virginia for sponsoring the measure at hand and given the significant contribution that the National Guard Youth Challenge Program makes to our nation, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="1202">H. Res. 1202</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join Congressman Dicks and me in honoring the students and graduates of the National Guard Youth Challenge Program and the people who support them by passing <bill type="hr" number="1202">H. Res. 1202</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 7,000 students drop out of high school every day, putting each of them at risk for drug use, gang violence, and abusive relationships. The National Guard Youth Challenge Program is a 17-month voluntary intervention program that gives at-risk youth a chance to develop and grow in positive ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What few people realize is that the National Guard Youth Challenge Program is the second largest mentoring program in the United States. The program emphasizes service to community, leadership development, team building, life skills training, health education, physical activity, educational and vocational instruction, citizenship, positive relationships with adults and peers, and career planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception in 1993, over 77,000 former high school dropouts have graduated from 35 youth challenge programs in 29 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Seventy-four percent of these graduates have earned their high school diploma or GED, and each year 25 percent go on to college, 20 percent enter the military, and 55 percent join the workforce in career jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A joint State and Federal effort, the National Guard Youth Challenge Program is growing and continuing to make a difference in the lives of our youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope you will join us in supporting the past, current, and future students of this program, and the goals and ideals of a National Guard Youth Challenge Day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1202">H. Res. 1202</bill>, a resolution that supports the goals and ideals of a National Guard Youth Challenge Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure celebrates the success of the National Guard Youth Challenge Program. Implemented by the National Guard in participating states, the program aims to address the growing national epidemic of high school dropouts by improving the education, life skills, and employment potential for "at risk" youth through military-based training and supervised work experience. The program is fundamental in giving young people a second chance to obtain their high school diplomas and to become productive  citizens within their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Guard Youth Challenge Program is results-driven and cost-effective. Since its inception in 1993, nearly 80,000 students have graduated from the program, and more than 90 percent of its graduates earn their high school diploma or GED, go to college, enter the military, or join the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I served as Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, I met with program participants and staff on numerous occasions and was impressed by the achievements of its graduates. The National Guard Youth Challenge Program has made a lasting impact on young people  and communities not only in Hawaii but across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a co-sponsor of this resolution, I appreciate the opportunity to offer a statement in support of House Resolution 1202, supporting the goals and ideals of National Guard Youth Challenge Day. I thank my colleague, Mr. Davis from Virginia, for having introduced this resolution so that today we are able to vote on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my career I have had a deep interest in programs that help our youth to develop into good citizens; citizens who will carry our Nation into the future, and citizens who are able to enjoy the satisfaction that comes from realizing their individual potential throughout their lives. It was a little over two years ago that I had my first direct contact with the National Guard Youth Challenge Program. I learned much about the program from meetings here in Washington, DC, where I heard about  its 80 percent success rate in participating youth getting a high school diploma or GED. I heard about the success in graduating over 77,000 youth from programs in 30 states and territories. And I learned about the impressive numbers of graduates going on to jobs in the economy, joining the military, or continuing their education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The statistics are impressive, but the experience that had the greatest impact on me was my visit to the Oregon National Guard Youth Challenge Program in Bend, Oregon. I was truly astounded by the stories that I heard from the young men and women there who found in themselves a desire to change, and made the commitment to the Youth Challenge experience to fundamentally change the direction of their lives. Many of these were youth who might otherwise have resigned themselves to a future of low  expectations that could include drug and alcohol abuse, gang membership, and dead-end job prospects. But they took a chance on the Youth Challenge program, and through their own commitment and hard work found value, discipline and direction for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am pleased to be able to tell my colleagues that the State of Washington is well on its way to establishing a Youth Challenge program of its own. The support from the State government and the community have been absolutely fantastic. Governor Chris Gregoire, our State Superintendent of Public Instruction Terry Bergeson, the Adjutant General Tim Lowenberg, and the legislature in Olympia, Washington have been enthusiastically behind this program all the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home town of Bremerton, Washington, the Superintendent of Schools and the school board have embraced the program and look forward to our program at the Washington Youth Academy making a difference for youth from across the entire state. At the Federal level, the National Guard Bureau has been unwavering in its support of all of the programs across the country, and for starting this new program in the State of Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The great thing about this program is that it sells itself. It just takes coming in contact with the positive energy young men and women in the program and their families to become a believer. By this time next year, I look forward to being able to report to my colleagues that the Washington Youth Academy will have graduated its first class of 150 youth who will be on a fundamentally different and more positive path for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I take great pleasure in supporting this resolution, and commend the National Guard Youth Challenge Program to the attention of all of my colleagues.</paragraph>
