  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9189">S9189</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to go immediately to the Defense authorization bill. The debate will be on the Dorgan amendment. Senators DORGAN and SUNUNU will each get 10 minutes to speak this morning. We will vote, I would announce to everyone, as soon as they finish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of people who are concerned about the schedule today. If we start to vote early, we will extend the vote for whatever time is appropriate to make sure people have the opportunity to vote. As I indicated earlier this week, the next weeks' work period will be very busy. We should have some late nights and hopefully no weekends, but that is even possible. There will be no votes on Monday.</paragraph>
