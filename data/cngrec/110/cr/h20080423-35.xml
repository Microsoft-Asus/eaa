    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand for the purpose to move <bill type="h" number="5479">H.R. 5479</bill>, which seeks to pay tribute to a Civil War veteran and hero, Mr. Alonzo Woodruff, by designating the North Kidd Street Post Office Building in Ionia, Michigan, after this forgotten soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5479">H.R. 5479</bill>'s introduction came on February 25, 2008, introduced by Representative Vernon Ehlers of the great State of Michigan and is cosponsored by the State's entire congressional delegation. The measure was considered and approved by the Oversight and Government Reform committee on March 13, 2008, which brings us to this morning's discussion on the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History reveals that Alonzo Woodruff was a Union soldier during our country's Civil War and received the Medal of Honor for his courageous acts of service at the 1864 Civil War Battle of Hatcher's Run in Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Woodruff's story of heroism and service provides an interesting glimpse into 19th century history. According to legend, Alonzo Woodruff was only 22 years old and recently married when the Michigan farmer joined the Union cause at the end of 1861. Two years later, Woodruff risked his life in hand-to-hand combat when he charged into Confederate lines to rescue a fellow soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in honor of Mr. Woodruff's heroism and dedication to preserving the United States, I would urge that we pass <bill type="h" number="5479">H.R. 5479</bill> without reservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would recognize the author of this resolution, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers), for as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the best part about this particular bill and our action on it is to inform us once again how important it is to remember those who have served this country well and have passed on, and to not forget them, because in this case, an entire community, after a period of 145 years, forgot the significance of this individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of this bill to designate the Ionia, Michigan, Post Office, located in my district, as the "Alonzo Woodruff Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, students from Ms. Maureen Powell's eighth grade American social studies class at Ionia Middle School heard about Alonzo Woodruff and the fact that the community had neglected him. They raised private funds, with the assistance of VFW member Commander Denny Craycraft, to place a monument honoring Alonzo Woodruff in front of the Ionia Courthouse. I attended that ceremony and learned a great deal about Alonzo Woodruff, a sergeant on the Union side during the Civil War, who was  an amazing man and did much for his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Michigan native, Sergeant Woodruff was born near Detroit in 1839 and was married to Harriet Hill in 1859 in Ionia County. Alonzo Woodruff was 22 years old when he joined the Union cause in 1861. At the Battle of Hatcher's Run in Virginia, Sergeant Woodruff fought, in hand-to-hand battle, to save and free a fellow soldier. He did this again on the same day by charging Confederate lines single-handedly to rescue another comrade held by a Confederate soldier. Sergeant Woodruff even made the Confederate  soldier his prisoner. For these actions, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both Patricia Provot and Sandra Provot Elmer, great-great-granddaughters of Alonzo Woodruff, support this initiative, as does Mayor Dan Belice of the city of Ionia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is most appropriate to honor Sergeant Woodruff by naming this post office building in his honor. We must remember the sacrifices made not only during the Civil War, but in every war, by prominently displaying Sergeant Woodruff's name in the Ionia Post Office. It is my hope that more people will remember and honor the bravery of all our young men and women who are fighting for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise today in support of this bill to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 117 North Kidd Street in Ionia, Michigan, as the "Alonzo Woodruff Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born near Detroit in March of 1839, Alonzo Woodruff was a simple man. He was a farmer by trade, but the recently married Woodruff decided to join the Union Army when tensions flared between the North and the South. He was 22 years of age at the time. In March of 1862, he was assigned to the 1st U.S. Regiment of Sharpshooters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October of 1864, Union forces continued their advance on Confederate lines at Hatcher's Run, Virginia. It was on October 27, 1864 that this simple farmer earned a place as an American hero. Posted on the extreme left of the Union line, Sergeant Woodruff and his comrade in arms, Corporal John Howard, encountered Confederate forces flanking their position. After discharging their weapons and being unable to reload, Corporal Howard engaged the Confederate leader in hand-to-hand combat, only to  be overwhelmed and severely wounded in both legs. Unloaded rifle in hand, Sergeant Woodruff fell upon the Confederate soldiers and through desperate hand-to-hand combat rescued Corporal Howard and facilitated their escape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additional accounts claim that later that same day, upon witnessing a  wounded private from his company being marched away as a prisoner by a rebel soldier, Woodruff again took decisive and brave action. Though he was severely wounded in the struggle, Woodruff succeeded in freeing his comrade, and in turn made the Confederate soldier his prisoner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 29, 1896, Sergeant Alonzo Woodruff was awarded the Medal of Honor. His citation reads, "Went to the assistance of a wounded and overpowered comrade, and in a hand-to-hand encounter effected his rescue."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, Woodruff settled in Lake County, Michigan, where he and his wife raised their three children. Alonzo Woodruff passed away in 1917, a true American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to support this bill honoring the life and actions of a simple man who answered the call to fight for the sound future of his country. In a violent and difficult time, his bravery embodies a commitment not only to his comrades, but also to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
