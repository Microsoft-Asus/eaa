    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of House Resolution 57, a resolution congratulating Illinois State University on 150 years of educating students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State Normal University was founded in 1857 as Illinois' first public university and opened with an enrollment of just 43 students. The university's very beginnings were touched by history. Four years prior to his election as President, Abraham Lincoln himself drafted the original bond guaranteeing that the citizens of Bloomington, Illinois, would finance Illinois State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally established as a teachers' college, Illinois State University now offers undergraduate degrees in more than 160 fields of study and 39 graduate programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the university enrolled more than 20,000 students, and 83 percent of its new freshmen students were in the top half of their high school graduating class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public colleges, as we know, provide a great service by offering affordable options of higher education and encouraging access for minority and low-income students. This role is increasingly important as the cost of attending college continues to increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State University has embodied this spirit of access to higher education in public service. It is not more clear than in its mission statement. And that mission statement reads: "We devote all of our resources and energy to creating the most supportive and productive community possible to serve the citizens of Illinois and beyond."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State University has graduated many notable alumni who have given back to the university, the State of Illinois, and this country in so many ways. There are an estimated 155,000 Illinois State University alumni living around the world, and many of these students have gone on to great accomplishments, including Thomas Edison's State College president George Pruitt; two-time Academy Award nominee John Malkovich; and former U.N. Ambassador for the U.S., Donald McHenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Illinois State University on 150 years of service to their students and alumni, the State of Illinois, and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to resoundingly pass this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 57, a resolution congratulating Illinois State, as it celebrates on February 15 its 150th anniversary of its founding. I would like to thank my good friend, Mr. Weller of Illinois, for introducing this resolution and recognizing the important role Illinois State University plays in educating the citizens of Illinois and many other States in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With more than 20,000 students, Illinois State University is a large-scale university with a small-college feel. Of the 20,000 students, there are 3,000 students enrolled in graduate degree programs. In addition to a number of graduate certificates, Illinois State offers 63 undergraduate programs and over 47 master's degrees, specialist and doctoral degree programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State University has been ranked as one of the 100 best values in public education by Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine. ISU actually jumped four spots, from 83 to 79, in Kiplinger's newest edition and was only one of two State schools to make the list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-six percent of Illinois State University students receive financial aid, and the school has a low default rate of 2 percent, well under the national default rate of 4.5 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State also recognizes the importance of educating students to become good teachers. Founded by Jesse Fell in 1847, Illinois State was the first public university in Illinois and was quickly established as a teachers' education institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, 150 years later, the university is the second largest producer of teacher education degrees in the country. In fact one in seven Illinois teachers holds a degree from Illinois State. Mr. Speaker, Illinois State University is a remarkable institution, and I would like to congratulate all of those students, the alumni and past and present employees on all that they have accomplished over the past 150 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution honoring Illinois State University on its 150th anniversary. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller) for sponsoring this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to add my voice as a Representative who has many hundreds of students and alumni from Illinois State University. I want to congratulate all of those associated with the university through those 150 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all of the years of success that they have had, it is a great value, a great part of our public university system in the State of Illinois. As a former college professor, I understand the importance of an education. I know how difficult it is today, especially, to pay for education. Schools like Illinois State give the opportunity for students in Illinois to get a great education at a great value and allow them to pursue so many things as they move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today I just want to congratulate the students, the alumni, the teachers, the administrators, everyone at Illinois State University on their 150th anniversary.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="57">H. Res. 57</bill>, a resolution honoring and congratulating Illinois State University on its upcoming 150th-year anniversary. I introduced this resolution with my good friend and colleague, Congressman TIM JOHNSON, with the support of the Illinois delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to note that the Illinois State University campus is located in the 11th Congressional District which I have the privilege of representing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 15, Illinois State University will start a year-long celebration marking the day that the founder, Jesse W. Fell, took up the campaign of creating the first public institution of  higher education in Illinois and having it housed in the Bloomington-Normal area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February of 1857, then-Governor William Bissell signed a bill, legislation creating Normal University, and established the board of education for the State of Illinois as its governing body. After Jesse Fell secured financial backing totaling $141,000, future President Abraham Lincoln, then acting as attorney for the board, drew up the bond guaranteeing that Bloomington's citizens would fulfill their financial commitments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established originally as a teacher education institution, then known as Illinois State Normal University, it has developed into a multipurpose university, recognized around the world with degree programs in the bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, approximately 20,000 undergraduates and post-graduate students attend the university, supported by an outstanding university staff of 3,200 employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also note that ISU today benefits from the support of over 65,000 alumni living and working around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues today have shared much about Illinois State University, but here is a few little-known facts. The model for student teaching that today is used nationwide was invented by Illinois State Normal University teacher Cecilla Lauby, who today is 94 years old and still lives in the town of Normal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of every eight teachers in Illinois graduated from Illinois State University. Illinois State University's insurance program is so popular and respected that Lloyd's of London sends it executives each year for management training. And as others have noted, Illinois State University has made the Kiplinger list for the 100 top universities in public education three straight times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State's physic's program is ranked as one of the top in the country. Illinois State's first president, Charles Hovey, recruited a regimen of teachers to fight in the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State is also the home of the Gamma Phi Circus, the oldest collegiate circus in the United States, which was founded in 1929. That circus today is one of two collegiate circuses in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would note that Watterson Towers dormitory on Illinois State University, is considered one of the tallest college dormitories in the world and is the tallest structure between the cities of Chicago and the City of St. Louis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State University has been a model for higher education institutions around this country over the last 150 years. I would like to note a very good friend of mine, Illinois State University's current president, Dr. Al Bowman, and congratulate him, his great staff and all of those affiliated with Illinois State University as they mark this great achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illinois State University has been a model for higher education institutions around this Nation for the last 150 years. I wish them all the best in their year-long celebration. I also want to thank the chairman of the committee, Chairman MILLER, and Ranking Member McKeon for allowing this bill to make it to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in wishing Illinois State University congratulations as it marks its 150th anniversary.</paragraph>
