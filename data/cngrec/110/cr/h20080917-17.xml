  <narrative>(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this country was really founded upon sacrifice, investment and opportunity for all, but over the last few years, we've seen the focus being on the wealthiest 1 percent in America to the exclusion of the rest of us, and that House of cards has come tumbling down on Wall Street over the last couple of weeks with the failures of the biggest corporations in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The policies of this administration not to regulate and the policies to only borrow and spend are causing this country turmoil, and the hardworking people in the middle are going to have to pick up the pieces. It is time for renewal. It is time for a change. The policies of the Democrats and of Barack Obama are going to change the direction of this Nation and make it stronger and make it the Nation that it can be.</paragraph>
