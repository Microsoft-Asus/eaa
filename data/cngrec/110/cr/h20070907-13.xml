    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am compelled to come before the body today to talk about my deep concern about our continued engagement in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 4 1/2  years, we have gone from "mission accomplished" to "mission untrue," and, in the words of one of our colleagues here on the Republican side, to "mission unknown." In fact, we are arming and fueling this growing civil war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have found Shia on Shia violence, Sunni on Sunni violence and Shia on Sunni violence. Our troops have no idea what the mission is anymore. I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that this is "mission impossible." It is time to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently we found that 190,000 weapons are unaccounted for. There are plenty of weapons in the ministry of interior, which has come to be a police force against our own troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we need to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
