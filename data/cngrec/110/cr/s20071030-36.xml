  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Steve Brimm of Spearfish, SD, for his nearly 40 years of service to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Mr. Brimm is retiring from his position as project leader to the D.C. Booth Fish Hatchery where he has served for the past 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The D.C. Booth Historic National Fish Hatchery is one of the oldest operating hatcheries in the country dedicated to fish culture and resource management. Under Steve Brimm's leadership, the fish hatchery has continued to thrive and benefit not only the Spearfish community but the entire Black Hills region. By forging partnerships and nurturing cooperation within the fish hatchery system, Steve has given the D.C. Booth Fish Hatchery a chance to become one of the most well-preserved fish hatcheries  in the United States. The hatchery has become an archival site for the Fish and Wildlife Service's fishery materials, and a functioning fish rearing facility, as well as being a tourist and economic attraction for the city of Spearfish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his dedicated service, Steve has been honored on both a State and national level. He was named a 2007 Take Pride in America National Award winner by the United States Department of the Interior and the Hatchery Helpers Youth Volunteer Program that Mr. Booth helped to develop was awarded a 2003 Take Pride in America National Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Steve Brimm on this special occasion and thank him for all his years of service to the D.C. Booth Fish Hatchery, the city of Spearfish, and the State of South Dakota.</paragraph>
