    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the dire situation in Africa that does not receive the attention it deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, along with Senator Russ Feingold, I introduced a concurrent resolution that I hope will eventually bring some peace to the ravaged region of northern Uganda. Specifically, it calls on the Government of Uganda and the so-called Lord's Resistance Army to recommit to a political solution to the conflict in northern Uganda and to recommence peace talks that are vital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also urges immediate and substantial support for the ongoing peace process from the United States and the international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the tragedy in Darfur rightfully has been receiving a great deal of attention as of late. But to the southeast of that region, another tragedy has been developing for nearly two decades. More than 200,000 Ugandans have died from the violence and disease brought about by the conflict between the Ugandan Government and the LRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is particularly disgusting about this conflict is the forced recruitment of children by LRA. The boys are turned into killing machines and the girls into sex slaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former U.N. Under Secretary General Jan Egeland has called the crisis in northern Uganda the biggest forgotten humanitarian emergency in the world today.</paragraph>
