  <narrative>CAMEL NO. 9 CIGARETTES -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11130]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss an important public health issue, particularly for young women and girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mother, grandmother and a former school nurse, I know all about the annual back-to-school shopping ritual. Each fall, kids and parents hit the stores to stock up on school supplies and new clothes. Unfortunately, this fall there's a new must-have item being advertised, and believe it or not, it's Camel No. 9 cigarettes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's being brought to our daughters, granddaughters and nieces by the folks at R.J. Reynolds, the same company that thought cartoon character Joe Camel was a responsible product spokesman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Camel No. 9 cigarettes are just the pink version of Joe Camel, or as one Oregon newspaper put it, "Barbie Camel." And R.J. Reynolds' tobacco marketing strategy is complete with fashionable giveaways to young women that include berry lip balm and mini hot pink purses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tag line for Camel No. 9 is "light and luscious," which sounds more like a tasty treat than a cancer-causing cigarette. Now there's even a Camel No. 9 stiletto line which evokes images of the sexy shoes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I'd like to remind R.J. Reynolds that there's nothing sexy about emphysema or dying prematurely from cancer. No amount of pretty pink packaging can obscure the fact that lung cancer is the number one cancer killer among American women, a truth that underscores big tobacco's desperate search for new smokers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we expect this kind of sleazy marketing from tobacco companies, I've been terribly disappointed that they've found a new and unexpected ally in women's fashion magazines. These magazines set the styles and trends for the country. They have historically served as legitimate sources for information on women's health and fitness, and they've sold out the well-being of their readers to help big tobacco in their search for new victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So back in June, 40 of my colleagues joined me in writing to the publishers of 11 leading women's magazines. We asked them to voluntarily stop accepting misleading advertising for deadly cigarettes, particularly for Camel No. 9. When not one of these magazines bothered to formally respond to our first letter, we wrote again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This time seven of them did respond, but none have committed to drop the ads. Several defended themselves by pointing to their editorials on the dangers of smoking, but how can a young impressionable reader possibly take that seriously when they can flip the page and find an advertisement for cigarettes that make them look as sexy and sophisticated as perfume?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just look at this ad printed in the October edition of "Glamour." This "Dressed to the 9s" piece encourages the "fashion forward" woman to embrace a vintage look and more closely resembles the magazine's regular editorial content on the latest fashions. The ad also helpfully recommends starting a vintage makeover with a little black dress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite frankly, it would be more appropriate to exhibit how it would look with black lungs and yellowed teeth readers would have after a life of smoking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This sort of deceptive advertising is brilliant in the eyes of marketers but shameful in the eyes of anyone who cares about public health. These ads are obviously targeted to appeal to young women and girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And although this magazine may claim that girls and teens are only a small fraction of their readership, I think that everyone can relate to the familiar scene of a young girl in line at the grocery store with her mom, flipping through the magazines that the cool older girls are reading. This is exactly what they would see in this issue of "Glamour." There's two more pages I don't have time to flip through myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen recently wrote on Camel No. 9 cigarettes and this deliberate effort to appeal to young women and girls. In her piece she noted that her own 18-year-old daughter had tried Camel No. 9, describing its taste and smell with words like perfume, caramel, and chai tea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So R.J. Reynolds and leading women's fashion magazines are pushing pink stiletto cigarettes that smell like perfume, taste like chai on ad pages that are virtually indistinguishable from the regular fashion content of the magazine. Yet, they continue to insist that this ad blitz, timed perfectly to coincide with the start of school, is in no way targeting our children? It would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, we're going to be having a hearing on <bill type="h" number="1108">H.R. 1108</bill>, introduced by my colleague HENRY WAXMAN, which would give FDA the authority to regulate tobacco, including advertising, and I hope that the magazines that are printing these ads don't wait until Congress passes a law in order to do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Camel No. 9 advertising blitz that greeted our students at the start of the school year is any indication of their intentions, I shudder to think of the tricks and treats R.J. Reynolds and its new friends in the magazine business have in store for our young women and girls this Halloween.</paragraph>
