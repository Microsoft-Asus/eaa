    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Israel's 60th anniversary and the progress it has made as a nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May, 1948, after almost 2,000 years of exile, Jews returned to their homeland and made the State of Israel a reality. Israel is a model of democracy in action and a pillar of humanity in the Middle East. Its civil liberties are guaranteed by laws, and its laws are protected by an independent judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its founding in 1948, Israel has been constantly aware of the necessity of a strong defense. Wars, conflicts, and terrorism have taught it the importance of utilizing innovative technologies to protect democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. was the first nation to recognize Israel as a state 60 years ago. Now our countries continue to cooperate in the fight against global terrorism and work together to create and maintain a strong ballistic missile system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month we celebrate how far Israel has journeyed since its birth. It is a model of human rights, democracy, and freedom. We are proud to call Israel an ally.</paragraph>
