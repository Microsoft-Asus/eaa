  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the war in Iraq, congressional Republicans have stood on the sidelines as the Bush administration proved time and time again that it could not manage the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Democrats took control of Congress we vowed things will be different. Mr. Speaker, we are living up to that promise. In the last month, House and Senate committees have held 52 hearings on the war in Iraq. Congress is finally asking the tough questions of this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week each of us has an opportunity to speak on the President's troop surge. Every single Member of this House will have 5 minutes to speak on the resolution. The House has not debated the issue of war like this since the first gulf war in 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people want Congress to take its oversight responsibility seriously. And this new Democratic Congress is doing just that.</paragraph>
