  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) In January 2003, the Government Accountability Office identified Federal real property as a high-risk area, citing excess property as a long-standing problem.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The magnitude of the problem with excess Federal real property continues to put the government at risk for lost dollars and missed opportunities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The Administration has stated its goal is to reduce the size of the Federal real property inventory by 5 percent, or $15 billion, by disposing of unneeded assets by 2015.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The Federal inventory includes many properties that are no longer relevant to agencies' missions and agencies are spending billions of dollars to maintain these unneeded properties.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) The costs of preparing a property for transfer or sale continue to hamper some agencies' efforts to address their unneeded properties and serve as a disincentive to disposal because, in the short-term, it can be more beneficial economically to maintain a property that is not being used than to dispose of it.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Agencies should give greater attention to right-sizing their real property portfolios.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the Federal inventory of unneeded and costly property.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand in support of <bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill>, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act, which is a sensible, bipartisan effort to address some of the problems with the current Federal property disposal process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are three key provisions in this bill. The first allows the General Services Administration to help pay the cost of other agencies' disposal activities. In particular, GSA will be able to help agencies pay costs with regard to properties that have yet to be declared excess. These costs include environmental cleanup, demolition, surveying, and life cycle costing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another key provision modifies existing law to make clear that when a property has been transferred to a nonprofit organization or a State or local government for a public purpose and that public purpose is no longer being met, the property must revert to the Federal Government, which must dispose of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final major provision allows all agencies to retain the proceeds from the sale of Federal surplus properties. These proceeds will be used for disposal activities such as developing and implementing a plan to identify and declare properties excess, appraisals, utilization studies, and life cycle planning. The Office of Management and  Budget has stated that allowing agencies to retain the proceeds will provide agencies with the funds necessary to cover  upfront costs associated with disposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does not waive any existing law regarding the screening process and therefore does not affect the access of homeless providers or State and local communities to these properties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Representatives Moore and Duncan for introducing this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for their dedication to this issue for many years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill>, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act, which was introduced last month by Representatives Dennis Moore of Kansas and John Duncan of Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would expand the number of agencies allowed to retain the proceeds from the sale of surplus Federal real property and would expand the authority of the General Services. It is very clear that this is a good bill, and I support it. It is also very clear that it is a step in the right direction but does not get us to where we really need to be. In fact, this is simply the tip of the iceberg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government is the largest landowner in the country. As such, it is essential that the government manage its properties as efficiently and effectively as possible. More importantly, property which is no longer of use to the Federal Government should be removed from the inventory. Unfortunately, over the years Federal property disposal processes have become increasingly cumbersome and unwieldy, and agencies often decide it's easier to sit on property than to try to get rid of it. In  fact, when we as a Congress have done rounds of BRAC, we have often had to do supplemental appropriations of dollars in order to give away property that has become surplus. In fact, OMB estimates a backlog of more than 21,000 properties in need of maintenance and repair carrying a price tag of more than $18 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Republican control, the Congress spent a considerable amount of time working, mostly on a bipartisan basis, to reform the Federal real property disposal system. The proposals we put forward for substantial changes provided real reform. Although <bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill> does not contain the kind of substantive reform put forward in prior Congresses, it is nevertheless an improvement on the current system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I therefore ask my colleagues to strongly support this legislation as a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing, today we have handled a great many important resolutions on the floor and some laws. We've done this on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we finish our suspensions for the House Oversight and Reform Committee, I would simply ask my colleagues, the Speaker, to take note that this past week, prices rose once again on gasoline in America. Up 17 cents in a blink of the eye, up a dollar since this Congress switched hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very clear that we need to begin operating on a bipartisan basis to bring down the price of gas and diesel fuel. We can only do that if we work on as much of a bipartisan basis as we work on these resolutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would ask all of my colleagues to note that the real problem America cares about today is not the 100 years of the Congressional Club. It is not, in fact, Arnold Palmer's accomplishments. It is not even Frank Sinatra's doing it his way. It is, in fact, America's inability to cope with rising gas prices, staggering unemployment, and the inability to live in one's own home. I ask that my colleagues take note of that and that we work on a bipartisan basis to bring a real resolution to these  problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to live in a democracy when we can recognize our athletes, when we can recognize our entertainers, we can recognize all of our people, along with doing the people's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea of a democracy says anyone at the lower end of the social economic scale as well as those at the top need recognition. We need to work together across aisles, not to be hampered by games that can be played, but sincerely coming together as a body representing the 280 million Americans and those who are not quite citizens and to do their work without phony procedures blocking our ability to make progress.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill>, as amended, and commend Chairman Waxman for taking steps to address Federal excess and surplus property issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill> authorizes the Administrator of General Services to obligate funds to pay for a variety of services that must be conducted before a property can be declared excess to the needs of the reporting agency. These services include title searches, site remediation, site security, and other activities necessary for a property to be declared excess. Further, the bill authorizes the General Services Administration to be reimbursed by the agency for these expenses from the proceeds of the sale  of the property. The net proceeds are retained by the donor agency and can be used only for disposal-related activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Waxman for recognizing the concerns of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure regarding the eligible uses of these net proceeds, and for working to address these concerns. The committee was particularly concerned that agencies, using this new-found source of revenue, would engage in real property activities that would otherwise need to go through the prospectus process and thus the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The  version of <bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill> being considered today specifically addresses the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's concerns by prohibiting the use of proceeds for activities or projects subject to the prospectus process and other requirements of section 3307 title 40, United States Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill>, as amended, and support placing the General Services Administration back in a leadership role for property disposal activities of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5787">H.R. 5787</bill>, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act. This is a bipartisan solution to address some on the deficiencies that exist in Federal real property management. I want to commend Representatives Moore and Duncan for introducing this bill, and Ranking Member DAVIS for working with me over many years on property issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As GAO has indicated by placing Federal real property on its "high risk" list, problems abound. One such problem is that unneeded buildings are in the Federal inventory. The magnitude of the problem with excess Federal real property means that agencies are spending billions of dollars maintaining properties no longer relevant to agencies' missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act seeks to address some of the hurdles that agencies are facing regarding disposal of their unneeded property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One key provision allows the General Services Administration to use its funds to prepare properties to be declared excess by other agencies. Agencies and GAO have testified that the cost of preparing a property for transfer or sale serves as a disincentive to disposal because, in the short term, it can be more beneficial economically to maintain a property that is not being used than to dispose of it. Basically, it is cheaper to pay to mow the grass and have a security guard than to do appraisals,  surveys, and environmental studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another key provision allows all agencies to retain 100 percent of the proceeds from sale. Most large landholding agencies already have this benefit. However, smaller ones, such as the Federal Communications Commission, which owns vacant towers, do not. After GSA obtained the authority to retain proceeds in 2005, its disposals increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill clarifies that when a piece of property has been given to a nonprofit or State or local government for a public purpose and that public purpose ceases to exist, the federal government must revert the property and dispose of it. The bill also calls on GSA to issue guidance on disposing of excess properties and requires agencies to develop and implement plans to dispose of their excess property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a commonsense measure and I am hopeful all members will be able to support it.</paragraph>
