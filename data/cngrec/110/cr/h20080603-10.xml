  <narrative>THE LITTLE FELLOW FROM IRAN -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4836]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the little fellow from Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is ranting and saber rattling again against Israel and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The L.A. Times reports the dictator said, "The Zionist regime of Israel ..... is about to die and will soon be erased from the scene". And, "The time for the fall of the satanic power of the United States has come and the countdown to annihilation ..... has started."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The devil of the desert is preaching hate and murder in the name of radical Islam. Throughout history more people have been murdered, pillaged, tortured, and plundered in the name of religion than any other reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Iran's dictator's involvement in supplying aid against the United States in Iraq, his support of Hezbollah, and his desire to have nuclear weapons to use against Israel, the world of nations must not diminish this loose cannon's evil ambition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Freedom-loving people of all nations and religions must see the dictator as a menace. Hopefully, the people of Iran will replace their trigger-happy leader with a regime that wants peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the meantime Ahmadinejad should never doubt the United States' resolve for a safe and secure Israel. The U.S. will do whatever necessary to keep the flame of liberty burning at home and in the Middle East, even if the little fellow doesn't like it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
