    <paragraph>Today, I rise with a heavy heart. Recently a good friend of mine, Sheriff Gary Clark of Caldwell County, passed from this Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Caldwell County lost a true leader and public servant, and many of us lost a dear and beloved friend when Sheriff Clark went home to be with his Lord after a brief, but valiant, fight against cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us who knew and loved Gary grieve the loss of his friendship. We are also grateful to know that he is no longer in pain and no longer suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sheriff Clark cared deeply for the needs of families and relentlessly pursued drug dealers and criminals in Caldwell County. He made a career of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was Sheriff Clark's passion for fighting against the scourge of methamphetamine and drugs that brought the White House drug czar to Caldwell County. His progressive innovative vision for law enforcement will create enormous benefits for years to come, not just in Caldwell County, but across western North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Caldwell County lost a hero and heaven gained a treasure. My prayers are with his family and with his friends in this time of loss. He lived a determined life, a proud life. And the legacy he leaves continues on because the good a man does lives long after he is gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we mourn the loss of Gary Clark, a great public servant and leader in North Carolina, a true law enforcement leader and a hero to those of us from western North Carolina.</paragraph>
