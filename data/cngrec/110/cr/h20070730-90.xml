    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor "Horn in the West," which this year is in its 56th consecutive season and is the third oldest outdoor drama in the United States. "Horn in the West" is also the oldest Revolutionary War drama in the Nation. It brings theatre-goers into the life and times of that legendary frontiersman Daniel Boone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Boone, North Carolina, "Horn in the West" outdoor drama captured the heart of this great struggle for freedom that was fought by mountain settlers in Appalachia during the Revolutionary War. In its 56 years of existence, the show has wowed more than 1.4 million people with its storytelling ingenuity and historical acumen. To this day it is not only entertaining thousands each year; it is also preserving a valuable story drawn from our Nation's early formative years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Horn in the West" was written by Dr. Kermit Hunter, an accomplished author and playwright who wrote more than 40 other historical productions. Dr. Hunter, who passed away in 2001, was a dedicated spokesman for the genre of the outdoor drama. His drama highlights the early freedom-seeking settlers who migrated to the Blue Ridge Mountains in an attempt to escape from the tyranny of British rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story of "Horn in the West" is told through the lens of Dr. Geoffrey Stuart, who came to the Blue Ridge with his family to study smallpox. A freedom lover himself, Stuart joined the band of colonists in opposition to the British. "Horn in the West" ushers the audience into a great moment in the lead-up to the Revolutionary War when this group of patriots suffers defeat and capture at the hands of the British in 1771 at the Battle of Alamance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Stuart, a model of the American spirit to forge ahead in the face of opposition, must rescue his son who is one of those captured by the British. The story weaves its way through Stuart's life, his important intervention with the Cherokee tribe, and his partnership with Daniel Boone. "Horn in the West" is the story of a man and a Nation coming to terms with the meaning of liberty and independence in a tumultuous time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to commend the people at "Horn in the West" for their steadfast commitment to bringing this important time and place to life for audiences in the town of Boone every year. They embody the ideals of America that this production encompasses: a love of freedom, a strong belief in the common man, and a dedication to what is right even in the face of uncertain odds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cast and supporting staff and board are dedicated to "Horn" and are doing a great job with very limited resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Daniel Boone Theatre that houses the outdoor production of "Horn in the West" is a magnificent setting for this historical play. When it was first reviewed, the critics raved that the theatrical setting was "one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful, in America" and that "the theatre alone is worth the price of admission."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Daniel Boone Theatre merits such praise. It is a masterful blend of architecture and landscape. Designed by the NC State School of Design and built in 1952, it deserves its title as the best outdoor theatre in the east. It sits on 35 acres of Blue Ridge Mountain terrain and was designed specifically with "Horn in the West" in mind. The theatre blends into the mountains with its careful use of native stone and landscaping. The theatre's designers took great pains to integrate existing vegetation  into the landscape so that today enormous rhododendron which were moved up the hill create a natural screen between the theater and the parking lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Horn in the West" production and the Daniel Boone Theatre are priceless pieces of North Carolina and American history. They preserve something of our past that in today's era of sound bite and image-obsessed is desperately needed. They remind us of our roots in a liberty-loving and free people who would give everything they held dear for the cause of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that "Horn in the West" continues to dazzle audiences with its depiction of our shared history. It is a valuable part of our history and culture, and I wish it many more decades of successful production</paragraph>
