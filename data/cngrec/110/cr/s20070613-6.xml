    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an hour this morning. The majority controls the first half, Republicans control the final 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the period of morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the comprehensive energy legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under an order entered last night, the time following morning business until 11:45 will be equally divided between Senators BOXER and INHOFE, dealing with an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe regarding oil refineries. So at 11:45, the Senate will vote in relation to the Inhofe amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other amendments are expected to be offered after the Inhofe amendment is disposed of, and votes will occur throughout today's session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator McConnell and I have a meeting at the White House this afternoon, so I don't think we will have a vote until about 3:30 or so after this first vote. I will also state it appears, because we need to move this Energy bill along, there will likely be no morning business tomorrow, so we should alert Members to that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding the Republican leader has something which he has to attend to.</paragraph>
