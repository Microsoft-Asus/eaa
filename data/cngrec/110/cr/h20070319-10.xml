    <paragraph>We are at the anniversary of the beginning of the war in Iraq. Things are not going well. Our troops are strained. Our generals are speaking to the President of the United States, who does not seem to be listening. I would like to read this to the President of the United States on this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked last month by a House panel whether he was comfortable with the preparedness of Army units in the United States, he stated simply: "No, I am not comfortable." Mr. President, that is one of your generals. General Peter Schoomaker, Army Chief of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday: "We have a strategy right now that is outstripping the means to execute it." Mr. President, that is one of  your generals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army Vice Chief of Staff, General Richard Cody, described as  "stark" the level of readiness of Army units in the United States which would be called on if another war breaks out. The readiness continues to decline of our next-to-deploy forces, Cody told the House Armed Services Committee Readiness Panel last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, hear your generals and end this war now.</paragraph>
