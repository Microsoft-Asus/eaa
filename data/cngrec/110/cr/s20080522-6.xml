    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader time, the Senate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany <bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>, the supplemental appropriations bill. There will be 2 hours of debate prior to a series of up to four rollcall votes in relation to motions to concur in House amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding the 2-hour time is equally divided between the parties. Is that true?</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, under the direction of Senator Byrd, Senator Murray will allocate the time on this side. I would further tell all Senators, because of the procedural glitch we had with the farm bill, we have not totally worked out what we are going to do on the farm bill yet. I had a conversation with the Speaker. I have spoken to both Parliamentarians--the House and Senate Parliamentarians. I think what we are going to do, as the House has done--I think at this time  it is our intention to override the veto of the President. He vetoed 14 of the 15 sections of the farm bill. Through a clerical error, section 3 was left out. As a result of that, section 3 will be sent to us from the House later today, having been passed, and we will</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, after we finish the work on the supplemental, we are going to go to, hopefully, the farm bill and the budget and complete all that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As all Senators know, for a number of personal reasons, not the least of which is the wedding of Senator DAN INOUYE on Saturday in Los Angeles, and his best man is Senator Stevens, they are not going to be here tomorrow. So as a result of that and other things, we are going to do our very best to complete work on what we have today, and we should be able to do that.</paragraph>
