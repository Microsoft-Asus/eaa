  <narrative>THE GOVERNMENT BAILS OUT FANNIE AND FREDDIE -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7857]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's no secret that our country is facing economic uncertainty with a rapidly rising national debt and a lingering housing and mortgage crisis. Just weeks ago, our Congress orchestrated a sweeping effort to prop up government-sponsored enterprises--GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--which own or insure half of our Nation's mortgages by exposing American taxpayers to vast financial risk. Now, just this past weekend, the Treasury has finalized a plan to officially bail out  Fannie and Freddie, a step I had hoped our government would not be forced to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It used to be argued that simply chartering Freddie and Fannie didn't mean that the Federal Government was on the hook if these mortgage giants collapsed, but now no one can make that case anymore. The recent and worrisome events occurring in the United States' housing market have revealed that the Federal Government bears significant risk in its chartering of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Although these two GSEs are supposed to make the American dream come true, the reality is that they are contributing  relatively little to the overall quality of the U.S. housing finance system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, they have created exorbitant risks both for the taxpayers and for the entire economic system that cannot be adequately addressed by simple regulation alone. Over the years, Fannie and Freddie have been allowed to incur $5.2 trillion in debt by borrowing $1.5 trillion and by guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities worth almost $4 trillion. Unfortunately, since January of this year, Fannie and Freddie's stock has also declined by about 90 percent. The collapse of these two, their  common shares, coupled with the current credit, housing and mortgage crisis and illiquidity of our markets, has clearly demonstrated that the financial and regulatory structures we have been operating have failed us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the hasty passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (<bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>), which I voted against, Congress granted the Treasury a broad new authority to inject capital into the struggling mortgage giants if that's needed. To the surprise of few, with a collapse imminent, the Treasury decided this past weekend it would transfer the control of Fannie and Freddie and place it into conservatorship, which is akin to the filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Treasury will now commence with buying  mortgage-backed securities from banks in the open market at the expense of American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this move will probably lower interest rates on home loans by, maybe, about 1 percent, the bailout won't stabilize home prices or swiftly curb the rate of foreclosures, which are currently at an all-time high. Thus, the immediate effect of the Treasury bailout of Fannie and Freddie will serve to benefit, for the most part, international stock exchanges and large central banks in foreign countries. To be specific, one of the biggest, immediate beneficiaries of this bailout will be the  central banks in Asia, such as the People's Bank of China, which has billions invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four years ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee: "The existence or even the perception of government backing undermines the effectiveness of market discipline," and he was right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must find an effective way to free our economy from the grips of this avoidable financial instability. In order to do so, Fannie and Freddie must be restructured and set on a path towards gradual privatization, for placing Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship is not a good long-term solution. Privatization is the most viable solution to mitigating the enormous risks posed by these out-of-control GSEs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be sure we never find ourselves in this situation again, Fannie and Freddie must be removed entirely from the government's account, be placed in direct competition with other financial institutions and be subjected to the effective discipline of the U.S. market. In this way, we can stabilize these important mortgage firms, restore confidence to investors and shareholders and relieve American taxpayers from the burden of another costly bailout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I call for an immediate investigation by this body into Freddie Mac's unreported financial results of almost $9 billion. Let's ask former CEO  Franklin Raines to explain these fraudulent audits that were presented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people deserve better than what these GSEs have to offer. We cannot allow them to leave us with a legacy of debt to be shouldered by hardworking Americans, for as Thomas Jefferson so aptly said a long time ago, "[the] principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling our future on a very large scale."</paragraph>
