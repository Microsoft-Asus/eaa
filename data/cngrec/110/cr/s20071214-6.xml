  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the order now before the Senate indicates we are going to move to the FHA bill as soon as we finish the farm bill. One of the key players on the Republican side is not going to be available this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would therefore ask unanimous consent that we go to the FHA bill before we do the farm bill. There is preliminary work on the farm bill to sort out germane and nongermane amendments anyway.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
