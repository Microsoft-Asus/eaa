    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the prices at the pump continue to hit record highs, House Democrats know that the  American people are struggling with these outrageously high prices. Some people are having to choose between buying gasoline and food. Others cannot afford to go to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the Bush administration conducted the bombing, the war and the occupation of Iraq, the price of gasoline was as low as $1.35 per gallon. Now it's over $4 per gallon. Oil was $23 a barrel. Now it's over $130 a barrel. There is no way, no way you can convince the American people that the price at the pump is not related to this misguided war and occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effects of the Bush-Iraq recession, and that is what it is, are devastating our economy and wreaking havoc on the lives of families and children. It's time our Republican friends in the Bush administration join us in supporting our legislation to bring down the price of gasoline, and it is time to end the war and occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Believe me, this will bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.</paragraph>
