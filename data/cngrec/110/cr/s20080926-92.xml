  <narrative>HONORING DORIS J. JOHNSON -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9648">S9648</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday morning I met Doris Johnson of West Memphis, AR, who was selected by Experience Works as the recipient of the 2008 Changing Lives Award for Outstanding Senior Community Service Employment Program, SCSEP, Participant. I want to congratulate Mrs. Johnson on receiving this award and changing her life through participation in the SCSEP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to her participation in the program, Mrs. Johnson's sole work experience was helping to run her family's sheet metal shop business for nearly 45 years. She managed many of the day-to-day office tasks which included sending and receiving invoices on behalf of the business. Unfortunately, in 1986, her husband's health began to deteriorate, and she suffered a heart attack herself. It was at this time that their son began running the company until it was eventually sold, when her husband passed  away in 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After her heart attack, Mrs. Johnson was not employed for nearly 20 years. In fact, her husband's death was very painful, and she rarely visited friends or ventured out of the house. But at the age of 77, realizing she needed additional income just to make ends meet, she contacted Experience Works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who are not aware, Experience Works is the Nation's oldest and largest provider of job training and employment opportunities for older Americans. Each year, Experience Works serves over 20,000 older workers and local communities through the SCSEP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly before her 78th birthday, Mrs. Johnson was placed with the Amazing Grace Thrift Shop on a training assignment. She quickly learned to sort and fold clothes, as well as price and sell items. In a short time, she and another SCSEP participant tripled the sales at the store.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She soon was encouraged to take a new job as a receptionist with the Arkansas Rehabilitation Service, ARS. It was not an easy transition, though. Mrs. Johnson suffered from hearing loss and was concerned about her ability to answer the phone. In addition, the phone system was rather intimidating, and she was unsure if she could adapt. The staff at ARS was impressed with her, though, and they worked to help her obtain new hearing aids. She was also a quick study during phone training. She not  only developed the skills to become a good receptionist but also took the initiative to take a phone list home so that she could learn employee names and extensions. Her work ethic, people skills, and ability to learn new task set her apart. In fact, her training supervisor has requested that she become the office assistant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has certainly made a difference in Mrs. Johnson's life. She says, "Being in the program has made a complete turnaround in my life." She displays a newfound confidence, and with some extra income, has returned to becoming an active senior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Johnson, I want you to know that you are an inspiration, not only to me and my colleagues but to the millions of seniors around our great State and across this country. Thank you for all you do, and good luck in your future endeavors.</paragraph>
