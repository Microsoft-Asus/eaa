    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 704 provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of this rule and <bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill>. I want to thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Subcommittee, Ms. Norton, Chairman Oberstar, and the ranking members, for drafting this legislation to authorize three new economic development commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3246">H.R. 3246</bill> establishes the Northern Border, Southeast Crescent and Southwest Border Regional Commissions and reauthorizes the successful Delta and Northern Great Plains Regional Commissions. These five commissions will  help bring economic development to regions of our country that desperately need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation creates a Northern Border Regional Commission that will bring much-needed job creation and economic development resources to the Northeast region. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and upstate New York will all benefit tremendously from the establishment of this commission because it will assess and address the very specific needs, assets and challenges of this region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several decades, upstate New York, including my congressional district, has experienced a consistent pattern of economic distress resulting from substantial loss in the manufacturing sector, coupled with an aging infrastructure and lack of opportunities for a skilled workforce. My district alone has seen a staggering loss of more than 14,000 manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2005. This has been devastating to our local communities; however, this loss isn't an anomaly. It is extremely  characteristic of several States in the Northeast. A targeted regional approach like this one created by this bill can help bring economic vitality to this region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The three new commissions are modeled after the highly successful Appalachian Regional Commission, ARC. The commission similar to the ARC will create Federal-State partnerships where local development districts and other nonprofits bring project ideas and priorities from the local level to the commissions to promote economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the Northern Border Regional Commission will be charged with investing $40 million per year, rising to $60 million per year by 2012, in Federal grants focused on local transportation and infrastructure projects, broadband development, alternative energy projects, agricultural development, and health care facilities. With regional planning, technical assistance, and funding of projects aimed at encouraging economic prosperity, this Commission will help local communities work together  to support common developmental goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, the numbers speak for themselves. Since its creation, the ARC has reduced the number of distressed counties in its region from 219 to 100, cut the poverty rate from 31 percent to 15 percent, and has helped 1,400 businesses create 26,000 new jobs. In fiscal year 2005, each dollar of the ARC funding leveraged $2.57 in other public funding and $8.46 in private funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking from personal experience, six counties in my upstate New York district have experienced similar success being a part of the ARC. The Village of Sherburne in Chenango County is a great example of how small ARC grants are extremely helpful in leveraging funds from State, local and private sources for economic development initiatives that create jobs. A $200,000 ARC grant to improve aging water infrastructure in Sherburne, New York, a problem that is plaguing many States in the Northeast,  was able to leverage close to $4 million in State and local community investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Northern Border Regional Commission will not only extend benefits to economically distressed counties in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont; it will give upstate New York counties like Oneida, Herkimer, Cayuga and Seneca the opportunity to enjoy the same benefits their neighboring counties in the southern tier enjoy under the ARC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to ensure that every American has access to job training, employment-related education and high-tech infrastructure so that we can retain and grow our global competitive edge. I am confident that the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act will help us achieve that end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act, which would authorize $1.25 billion to create three new regional commissions and replace two other regional commissions. These five regional commissions would be Federal-State partnerships that would provide grants to State and local governments to promote infrastructure and economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I believe that comprehensive, regional approaches to addressing infrastructure and economic development needs often can be beneficial, I am not convinced that creating five commissions and the layers of bureaucracy associated with them is necessary to provide grants to communities most in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act was originally considered by the House on September 17 under suspension of the rules, which limits debate, bars amendments and requires a two-thirds vote for passage. Bills typically considered under suspension of the rules are bills and resolutions to name post offices and Federal buildings, congratulate sports teams and to raise general awareness of other issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generally, bills authorizing $1 billion in government expansion are not considered under a process with limited time for debate and no opportunity for amendment, but that is what the Democrat majority chose to do with the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act last month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of concerns either with the underlying bill or with the way in which this bill was originally considered, it failed to garner a two-thirds vote and did not pass under suspension of the rules. This closed rule does provide for more time to debate the merits of the underlying bill, but, unfortunately, it also shuts Members out from offering amendments to make this perhaps a better bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Republicans believe that every earmark should be debatable on the House floor. Republican Leader Boehner has introduced a proposal to improve the House rules and allow the House to debate openly and honestly the validity and accuracy of earmarks contained in all bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, 196 Republicans have signed a discharge position to bring this measure to the House floor for a vote. Unfortunately, we are still 22 Members shy of what is needed. Therefore, I not only would encourage all Members of the House to sign the discharge position, but I will also be asking my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question so that I can amend the rule to the House to allow the House to immediately consider House Resolution 479 introduced by Republican Leader Boehner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital that the House of Representatives act today and pass House Resolution 479 so that we can show American taxpayers we are serious when it comes to earmark transparency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question, Mr. Speaker, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings. But I must say that I am a bit confused as to what earmarks and what the statements that he just made have to do with this rule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Washington.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be more than happy to tell you. We  think that the intent on both sides of the aisle was to have all earmarks have a transparency to them so we know where those earmarks come from. Under this rule, we are self-executing an amendment, and that amendment is not covered, is not covered under the transparency. Now, I don't know if there is something within that bill that has earmarks that aren't being reported, but Leader</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding on this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. With all due respect, I couldn't disagree more. While some of my colleagues on the other side continue to criticize our new earmark rule, the fact of the matter is that the House Democratic majority has implemented the most honest and open earmark rule in the history of the United States House of Representatives. But don't take my word for it. In this week's CQ Weekly, Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense is quoted as saying: "The House has  given us more information than we have ever had before on earmarks, and they deserve credit for that."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the other side continues to talk about their plan to modify the earmark rule, but what they don't tell you is that their earmark rule would not cover any measure not already covered by the earmark rule presently in effect. It is important to remember which side actually abused the earmark process, and who actually stepped up to the plate to reform the system and provide transparency. We didn't wait until 2 months before the election; we responded to the people's call for more openness  on the first day of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems quite clear to me that the minority is more concerned with obstructionism, while we are focused on actually meeting the needs of our constituents. That is exactly what this bill does and what the underlying rule does.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Washington.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I appreciate that he has a little bit different view than I have. I would ask the gentleman, what bills are covered by the earmark rule, transparency rule, that you are talking about today? What bills?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>This bill today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>The rules only cover appropriation bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I may reclaim my time, the bill today is covered by it. As I say, this bill is about helping Americans. This is about putting Americans back to work and about putting money back into the development of infrastructure, into financing hospitals, and doing the kind of things that I was sent to Congress to do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, passage of this bipartisan legislation, which this rule provides consideration of, is a critical step toward helping some of our neediest communities achieve economic parity with the rest of the country. The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act authorizes the creation of five regional economic development commissions under a common framework of administration and management. These commissions are designed to address problems of systematic underdevelopment  in their respective regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In general, the five commissions authorized in this bill will utilize the successful Appalachian Regional Commission model, which facilitates a bottom-up approach. Local development districts, nonprofit organizations, and others bring projects and ideas to the commission from the local level, ensuring that the actions of the commission reflect local and regional economic development needs and goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned a short while ago, the Northern Border Regional Commission created by this legislation builds on the success of the ARC. It would be charged with investing $40 million each year in Federal resources for economic development and job creation in the most economically distressed border areas of Maine, New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont. This commission will help fund projects that both strengthen traditional sectors in the region's economy and help to diversify it.  The Northern Border Regional Commission is focused on helping areas in the Northeast that have higher levels of unemployment, a significant loss of population, and significantly low household incomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is yet another example of true bipartisan cooperation often seen on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote "yes" on the previous question and the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material referred to previously by Mr. Hastings of Washington is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="704">H. Res. 704</bill> Offered by Mr. Hastings of Washington</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sec. 3. That immediately upon the adoption of this resolution the House shall, without intervention of any point of order, consider the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="479">H. Res. 479</bill>) to amend the Rules of the House of Representatives to provide for enforcement of clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. The resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to final adoption without intervening motion or demand for division  of the question except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules; and (2) one motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on ordering the previous question.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.</chair>
