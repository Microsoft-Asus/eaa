    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007. The bill has seven provisions and is revenue neutral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill will repeal this excursion into private companies collecting the debt for the Internal Revenue Service. We've had many hearings, and the Internal Revenue Service, on more than one occasion, had indicated that, given the resources, they could do a more effective job than having to subcontract out to private firms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's nothing magic about privatization. Just saying that it's privatized doesn't mean that it's more effective or that you're doing the right thing. And I think, in this great country of ours, there is a special relationship between the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one would ever like the tax collector, but you do feel a little more secure when you know that a public servant is doing his or her job, rather than this job being sold out or given out to somebody that's income is going to be based on how much taxes they collect today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, if you've got to call the office and ask the taxpayer to pay, or call his home, let it not be a ride-by-night firm that is just getting involved in tax collection of Federal indebtedness. Let it be someone that you can trust, let it be a civil servant, and let it be the people that, over the years, have done the job, and no good reason has been given by anybody as to why they should not continue to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only sad thing that you can say about the collection of taxes by the IRS is that, admittedly, we never gave them the money; we never gave them the resources. But no one can challenge that there's no one better trained to do the job than the Internal Revenue Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then, of course, I want to thank Representative Meek and Representative Herger for providing leadership in repealing this provision that would address the 3 percent withholding rate on certain government payments for goods and service. It didn't look good then; it doesn't look good now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides some equity to our citizens in the Virgin Islands to ensure fairness in tax collection there, and eliminates the restrictions on the statute of limitations, which means that their statute of limitations is our statute of limitations, that we're all citizens in this together, and they're not second class in this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, of course, we want to say that this bill is revenue neutral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy) and give him the opportunity to control that time.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased that the chairman and I have forged a good working relationship. That relationship has allowed us to work together on several important issues, including trade and some tax bills. Just last week, for example, I stood on the floor and joined with the vast majority of Members on both sides of the aisle to approve a bill helping relieve homeowners of the tax burden that comes with having a mortgage written down or foreclosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the chairman and I know that there are times when we will not agree, and today is just such an occasion. The central feature of this bill is a repeal of a program at the Internal Revenue Service that allows the service to contract with private collection agencies, known as PCAs, to secure payment of unpaid taxes from individuals who have admitted they owe the government money, but simply have not actually paid the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's true, as the majority likes to argue, that the IRS's own taxpayer advocate has urged Congress to repeal the PCA program. But some of her reasons are a bit suspect. For example, her report criticized the use of private collection agencies because, by doing so, "the IRS has separated taxpayers from its world class customer service."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while I agree that IRS employees are competent, hardworking public servants, and I commend them for the job they do, surely the person who wrote that did so with tongue firmly planted in cheek. After all, how many of us, in conversations with our constituents, have heard from them that the IRS is known for their customer service?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More importantly, though, IRS reviews of the PCA program show that customer service satisfaction with those PCA programs is, in fact, very high. In their comments on the taxpayer advocate's report, the IRS noted that "of the nearly 19,000 cases assigned to PCAs, only 108 taxpayers have requested that their accounts be handled by the IRS. There have been 31 reported contractual complaints, all of which have been reviewed in depth. There have been no instances of fraud or misuse of taxpayer information."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That record is not surprising, considering the extensive training PCA employees receive and the limited information they are provided. That, I should point out, stands in sharp contrast to the many documented lapses of the IRS in protecting confidential taxpayer information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Program opponents often suggest that there is something intrinsic about tax collection that should preclude it being contracted out to the private sector. This argument is hard to reconcile with a few basic facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the PCAs are not adjudicating tax liability. They are merely helping to ensure the government receives the amounts the individuals have already admitted they owe in taxes but have not paid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, PCAs are used throughout the Federal Government to collect unpaid obligations. According to the IRS, since 1982, PCAs have been used by various branches of the Federal Government, collecting nearly $700 million in fiscal year 2005 alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, of the 43 States with a personal income tax, the vast majority of those use private agencies to help collect from delinquent taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A hearing on this issue showed the members of the committee the skill and patience PCA employees use to avoid disclosing any confidential taxpayer information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would urge the PCA program be modified to provide these contractors with additional tools that will both improve their recovery rate and reduce the possibility of taxpayer confusion about the purpose of calls and letters from the PCAs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though these agencies lack many of the tools of the IRS, such as lien and levy, they are successfully collecting millions of dollars in unpaid taxes that the IRS has not and very likely would not ever get around to collecting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority will no doubt argue that the cost to the taxpayers would be even less if the IRS went after these obligations. But the fact is they are not, and any such comparisons are apples to oranges. The IRS is currently ill-equipped to engage in the massive outbound call operation the PCAs use to collect these obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first year of the program's operation, more than 90,000 cases have been placed with the PCAs. More than 7,300 have resulted in full payment, and more than 2,600 taxpayers have entered into installment agreements. The PCAs have already collected $32 million in gross revenue that would not have been collected otherwise, making this a tax-gap closing program with a proven track record. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that killing this program will result in the loss of over $1 billion in  revenue over the coming decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Considering the difficulty of meeting the terms of PAYGO, it's rather disappointing that the majority would actually find it necessary to raise taxes elsewhere in order to terminate a program that is helping to close the tax gap. In fact, during committee markup, members of the Ways and Means Committee suggested a number of ways to use the money that the majority is spending today by killing this program, including delaying the implementation of a withholding rule on Federal contractors or providing  penalty relief to taxpayers who are underwithholding their 2007 taxes because they are unaware of the coming hit of the AMT, which the majority has yet to pass, but I'm sure that we will get around to that. Unfortunately, those amendments were rejected on party-line votes in the committee, and, of course, we are not being given a chance to vote on those today in this House.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in a time where there is a complete fascination in this administration with contracting out. If you are happy with Blackwater in Iraq, then I expect you are perfectly fine with contracting the debt collection of IRS debt to private bill collectors. But there are some essential facts at issue which should give us pause to reconsider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the start-up costs. We were told, in testimony by the IRS Commissioner, this venture was going to cost about $14 million to get up and running. The tab so far, $70 million, five times the anticipated cost to begin this venture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, you might say, well, okay, start-up costs are a little more than expected, but how are we doing on receipts now that we have got them fully going, collecting these receipts? We don't have a very good story on that one either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was anticipated that $46 million to maybe $63 million would be collected. Coming in at about half of that anticipation, $32 million in. It costs five times more to start and bringing in about half as much as advertised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, okay, $32 million. It still sounds like a lot. Well, not really when you consider the fact they have been given 118,000 cases with an unpaid debt of $512 million. For the kind of money we have invested, do you know what we are getting back? We are getting about a 6 percent return from this experiment in private debt collection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You might be asking yourself, look, there must be some more efficient way to do this. Well, there sure is. Let's fund the IRS, hire, train, manage the debt collection. My gosh, if there is one government responsibility, it ought to be in making certain that the revenue owed is the revenue raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the statistics show by the IRS themselves that for $1 spent on IRS staff collecting debt, you get a 20 to 1 return, $20 back for every $1 spent. Private debt collection, the IRS again projecting, at best, $4 back for every $1 spent. That's $20 if we hire to $1 spent, $4 if we hire to every $1 spent under contracting. And that's their projection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look, at $32 million collected and $70 million spent, we are collecting 50 cents for every dollar spent so far. That's pretty bad business. If we had spent the $71 million to hire a Federal collection staff, we would have already collected $1.4 billion. That is the total amount they project over 10 years under this experiment of private debt collection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sit on the Ways and Means Committee. And as we considered this notion before it became operative, I thought this is the most expensive way to do this. It reminded me of that $600 toilet seat that the Department of Defense paid for awhile back. I call this a $600 toilet seat of tax collection. Well, when you look at it, they have taken $70 million to build this gold-plated throne and they flushed away $50 million on this foolish experiment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many reasons to end this ill-advised endeavor, and the speakers we present are going to offer those reasons. But the fundamental is it's a matter of dollars and sense, and this don't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it's appropriate that we talk about a $600 toilet seat because, indeed, this bill smells to high heaven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth of the matter is you will hear a lot of wild claims made on the House floor today, but in truth the Joint Taxation Committee, Congressional Budget Office, and every other independent agency has testified that passing this bill will cost the American taxpayers more than $1 billion. It is a testament that this program is working and will continue to work to save dollars for the American taxpayer by going after those who owe their taxes on behalf of those of us who pay our taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>. This bill would eliminate a program that is actually making money for the government: overdue tax bills collected by qualified private companies from people that owe too little for the IRS to use up valuable resources in going after them. To date, the IRS has turned over 90,000 cases worth nearly half a billion dollars. And the dollars add up to the tune of $32 million collected since last month, and there's more to come. As I said,  more than $1 billion over the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is money that is helping to close the tax gap and is revenue that the Treasury Department can use to hire more employees. Under the program the IRS can retain up to a quarter of the collection to hire additional enforcement workers, and already some $5.7 million has been designated by the IRS for collection activities and $20 million has gone toward deficit reduction. So it is helping reduce the Federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some argue that collection agents have harassed taxpayers. The reality is that these agents are held to the same standards as IRS employees when it comes to protecting taxpayer rights. As a matter of fact, out of 51,000 cases, it was testified at our recent Ways and Means Committee hearing there were no, zero, violations of taxpayer privacy, zero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These companies do face difficulties in finding the correct person, as the IRS does not provide the collectors with the taxpayers' last known phone numbers. This might be an area to look for reforming, rather than killing, this important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some argue that the IRS could collect the same debts more cheaply if they could hire more employees. But the truth of the matter is these taxpayers have already been contacted four times by the IRS and they have not had luck in collecting them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A GAO report in 2004, General Accountability Office, says that these private companies can recover $4.60 for every $1 spent while additional IRS employees would recover less, would be less efficient in recovering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that the program is working, taxpayer rights and privacy are being protected. The program allows IRS to do what they are good at: enforcement of higher profile debts while allowing private collection agents who have to be qualified to collect smaller debts owed by tens of thousands of taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And private debt collectors aren't a novel idea. Other Federal agencies and many States, 40 States, and thousands of local government agencies use private agents to collect everything from overdue income taxes, alcohol and cigarette taxes, to local property taxes. It's working, and it would be a disservice to taxpayers who actually pay their taxes on time to discontinue it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line truly, Mr. Speaker, is are we serious about closing the tax gap. Are we serious about collecting the debts that are owed? People here tend to always see things in black and white, and you will hear this in the debate today. You are either for or against the IRS, for or against private debt collectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth of the matter is our goal is to collect the taxes the most efficient way. It will take a partnership of our IRS employees, who do an excellent job, and private debt collectors, who do an excellent job in the tougher debts, to collect in order for the taxpayers to truly get the dollars that they are owed and this country the dollars that are truly owed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the unrefuted data is that IRS collection with IRS staff is five times more efficient in terms of dollars received than contracting out. If we are worrying about IRS efficiency, do it on the staff model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I might say that their cost estimate about this bill contemplates that the IRS would hire no staff, would just forget hiring out contractors, hire no staff, and just walk away from them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. We have got a very different notion. We want to take the money we are sending to these private bill collectors and hire IRS staff that are going to collect on this five-to-one ratio. We have got a much better, more efficient model to address this issue of unpaid balances owed to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act, a bill to eliminate the IRS's private debt collection program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The private debt collection program is an insult to the American taxpayer and our Federal tax system. The collection of taxes is a core government function. It is the mission of the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on this program, and we found that it has no business, no place in the collection of taxes. This program violates the public trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayers trust the IRS with their personal information. When taxpayers put information on their tax returns, they expect that the IRS will see that information, and only the IRS. Taxpayers do not expect their personal information could be given to private debt collectors. It should never ever happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayers have been harassed under this program. Thousands of innocent taxpayers are being called on the phone and asked for their Social Security numbers. They are afraid that their identity will be stolen. In some cases, the calls are never-ending. We found that one elderly couple was called 150 times over 30 days. That's not right. That's not fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program targets low-income taxpayers, and these private debt collectors have even gone after nursing  home residents and military personnel serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That is unbelievable. Use of private debt collectors erodes the Federal tax system, the public trust and the Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say, Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We must stand with the taxpayers, and we must stand up for the IRS employees. Pass this bill and end this program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the General Accountability Office has testified that, in fact, private debt collectors are more efficient per dollars than the IRS employees with these types of debts, which is what we are comparing. And, again, we have IRS employees with the ability to levy liens and fines, they are able to compel certain types of taxpayers to pay efficiently, and they can go after the larger, more complex cases very well. It is this group here that we've  had difficulty collecting taxes from in the past that these proven tax collectors across 40 States have done such a good job collecting. And that is the bottom line; are we going to collect the taxes of the American people or not?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would yield 2 minutes to the ranking member of the Trade Subcommittee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Herger), who has worked very hard on behalf of American taxpayers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Tax Collection Responsibility Act. This legislation would unwisely eliminate an IRS program which collects otherwise uncollected tax debts, refusing as much as $2.2 billion in Federal revenue. In addition, this partisan measure does a disservice to the overwhelmingly bipartisan effort to repeal the 3 percent withholding burden before it takes effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In less than 4 years, 3 percent of all payments made by a government to a business or individual providing goods or services will be unfairly withheld as a prepayment on taxes. This will needlessly reduce cash flows for thousands of small businesses across the U.S. Today's bill merely delays 3 percent withholding implementation for 1 year, but that does not solve this real and pressing problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Congress should do is follow the broader proposal my friend KENDRICK MEEK of Florida and I have introduced, repealing this withholding tax outright. Pairing a scaled-back 1-year delay with the majority's repeal of the private collection agency program wrongly splits the bipartisan, broad-based full repeal initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Meek-Herger proposal has 219 cosponsors from both parties. Further, the closed rule prohibits a Republican substitute that would have provided for consideration of the full 3 percent withholding repeal alone and on its own merit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members to reject this flawed bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, we're talking about uncollected taxes that are uncollected because of a systematic effort by this Republican administration and a Republican Congress to undermine the ability of the IRS to do its job, cranking up the audits on the poorest of citizens while stopping the IRS from oversight of those who are more wealthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my good friend from North Dakota pointed out, we're talking about a 6 percent rate of return, when the independent officer, who has been set up within the IRS to give the independent judgment, has pointed out that this same $71 million would collect over 1.4 billion uncollected tax dollars. Independent observers know that investing in the IRS and its employees rather than unaccountable private contractors will get more money and will do so in a more humane fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was shocking for the committee to listen to some of the phone calls, to the abuse that has been subjected to American taxpayers who are caught in the "Alice in Wonderland" of these private collectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues, if they have any doubt, to try an experiment. I have done this at home. I have met with CPAs, tax attorneys and with financial advisers. All of them suggest investing more in the IRS infrastructure to improve customer service, and it will collect more money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would strongly suggest that it is time to stop this dark chapter of emasculating the IRS, giving money to private contractors, and instead, do a better job for the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I for one support the notion of the 1-year suspension of the 3 percent contractor withholding. I think it makes sense to try and sort this out. I think it needs more examination. I think we can have a better proposal. This got slipped in in the Senate without any House consideration in the last Congress. I think a delay makes sense. I support it. I support the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would point out that this practice has already generated nearly $6 million for additional IRS agents in collection activities at the agency.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400044" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Brady for yielding, and I rise to oppose <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me start, Mr. Speaker, by saying that I strongly support the right of public and private employees to organize and to work for better working conditions and to improve the quality of life in their workplaces and in their communities, and my record reflects that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I think there is something that we all agree upon, as Democrats, as Republicans, as public employees, private sector employees, and that is that there is a huge tax gap in this Nation, and that tax gap is to the tune of $345 billion. It adds, on the average taxpayer, about $2,700 to its tax bill on an annual basis. These are tax dollars, most of them having been acknowledged by the taxpayer that they owe, but the IRS has not been able to go after them for whatever reason. And so the  IRS private debt collection program is putting money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to tell you that the private collection agencies working on this contract do not replace a single IRS worker, and no IRS jobs are lost through this program. To date, this program has recovered about $30 million in delinquent taxes. Through this pilot project, the IRS has turned over about 77,000 cases worth nearly $450 million in unpaid taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I heard some speak about harassment, undue harassment by private collectors. I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that this program is closely scrutinized by the IRS. And the IRS program has, according to the Internal Revenue Service itself, received a 98 percent favorable rating from the IRS for regulatory and procedural accuracy, and a 100 percent rating for professionalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program has also received at or above a 96 percent rating for taxpayer satisfaction. Less than 1 percent of those taxpayers collected by the private collection agencies have filed complaints with the IRS, and none of those complaints against the companies currently participating in the program have been validated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this program is bringing in money to the U.S. Treasury without raising taxes and closing that tax gap, and will be able to close that tax gap if we can keep the programs and improve them, money that otherwise would never be collected. To this end, it would be a very bad message to send that we are not serious about closing the tax gap.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>We had hearing testimony on the survey that was referenced by my friend from Florida. Basically, the GAO testified that the survey was fundamentally flawed. Of 300,000 conversations that have taken place, 1,000 were the subject of the survey for getting taxpayer satisfaction, and the private debt collectors were able to pick which ones got the survey. So a 1,000 survey sample out of a 300,000 universe, with those stakeholders picking the ones that get to say it, was not deemed as  credible by the GAO and not deemed as credible by the majority on Ways and Means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a cooked-up survey that was just referred to. In the words of the former IRS Commissioner, Mark Iverson, appointed by President Bush, he testified that the IRS can collect Federal taxes more cheaply, more efficiently than private companies. I rest my case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>. This legislation is designed to protect taxpayers by repealing the authorization for the IRS to use private contractors to collect Federal income taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few would disagree that the collection of Federal taxes is an inherent government function. We have seen, through multiple hearings in Ways and Means, that privatizing and outsourcing this fundamental role has been a mistake on many levels. We've learned of numerous cases of harassment, not overexaggeration, on the record, abusive calling, violations of the rights of taxpayers. We've discovered that some taxpayers, many of whom were elderly, have had to endure literally hundreds of phone calls  from private collectors. We listened to those phone calls. We had them on tape. Tapes are a terrible thing, you know. They don't lie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other cases involve people in nursing homes, those who have served in Iraq, and low-income taxpayers facing economic hardships. And as if taxpayer harassment was not enough, we have also seen that the program is inefficient. So far, privatizing tax collection has actually cost us money. Currently, we are $50 million in the hole. The IRS has spent $71 million to collect a net of $20 million. This is just like the postal department with the privatizing of providing mail throughout the United States.  Now they're backing off, finally. It has been a disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After paying $5.5 million in commissions to the private debt collectors, they make a commission of $5.5 million, and they can't do the job. This just doesn't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if $70 million was spent on IRS employees instead of private contractors, statistics project that they would have collected over $1.4 billion. That's quite a difference, indeed. And taxpayers deserve more. They expect to deal with their government when they have a tax problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private debt collection must end, and today we do that. I thank Chairman Rangel and JOHN LEWIS, chairman of the Ways and Means Oversight. I thank Congressman Rothman from the State of New Jersey for his persistence. I implore all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would point out that at the Ways and Means hearings, the Government Accountability Office testified they had looked for but could not find any evidence that the private collection agency selected individuals for the survey based on their perception of what the responses would be. I would point out that the same agency testified that there were zero, no violations of any privacy rights through 51,000, and growing, cases, zero violations. And I do wish that those  telephone tapes could be played here on the House floor so members of the public as well as Congress could hear the professionalism of those phone calls as they seek to identify sensitively the individuals who do owe dollars to the American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will point out, too, that if these debts were so easy to collect by the IRS, why did the IRS already have four opportunities to collect them from each taxpayer before they were turned over to these agencies, who have done such a good job, a solid job of collecting them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds) who has not only fought on behalf of taxpayers but has a number of women and minority workers and professionals in his district who have done a wonderful job in this arena.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. REYNOLDS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400338" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bill before us today. I thank the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee for his ongoing efforts to defeat this misguided proposal and other members of the Ways and Means Committee who have also carried a strong voice, such as the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some Members of this body and both sides of the debate, this issue is simply about policy. We understand that. For them, it is an abstract question about whether private collection agencies or so-called PCAs should be able to play a limited, supplementary role in the IRS's efforts to collect delinquent tax debt. But for me and the area I represent in western New York, it is about both policy and much more than that. It is about jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress who represents rural Wyoming County in western New York, I am actually more familiar than most with the work that PCAs do. After all, the largest single private employer in Wyoming County is Pioneer Credit Recovery. It is one of only two companies nationwide that the IRS has selected to help get its important program underway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Pioneer Credit is a highly respected, local business that has created more than 1,400 high-paying jobs for families living in either my district or neighboring districts around Buffalo and Rochester. As my fellow members of the western New York's congressional delegation know, these jobs have been created in a region that has faced serious economic challenges. As I have listened today to this debate, sometimes you wonder just exactly who might be on that phone. These are highly trained  rural folks coming from communities much like the gentleman from North Dakota has in North Dakota. It just happens to be a rural area of a large State of New York. For some people, that is their only income to the household. For some it is a supplement to farm income or manufacturing income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they are hardworking, decent people who subscribe to Federal and State laws that this honorable body actually has set forth in the past that deliberated and said, you will function as collectors. I know one thing about the people's House: We have had a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds, but you know, as a small businessman myself, I promise you the only time I send out, in the days I was in business, to a private collection agency was when I couldn't collect that money for  an insurance premium or commissions owed and I had no other recourse but to look in private collection. They professionally got the job done to bring back money that was owed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague, Mr. Brady, has pointed out, the IRS sometimes had four chances to kind of get this money and still didn't come back with it. We looked at an opportunity, could we gain over 10 years over $1 billion in order to increase the revenues or address the tax gap that my colleague from Florida talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when the IRS contract was allowed to Pioneer Credit to turn an empty warehouse in Perry, New York, into a thriving job center for newly hired employees, it has been a great economic success story for part of western New York that desperately needed it, and it began to produce the results that the Congress and the IRS expected. So as someone who has fought to give the IRS the authority to partner with these private companies in the first place, I am deeply troubled that the new majority is  now threatening to deauthorize this important program just as it gets underway. If this program is allowed to continue, Pioneer Credit will be given the opportunity to compete for future IRS contracts that could create many additional jobs in the area I represent. Killing this program, on the other hand, would cost my constituents real jobs at a time when Congress should be working to expand employment opportunities, particularly in hard-hit areas that are struggling economically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also note, Mr. Speaker, that under the Democrats' PAYGO rules, proposals that reduce anticipated Federal revenues must be offset by other provisions that raise revenue. Thus their proposal to eliminate the PCA tax collection program, which is expected to net at least that billion dollars over the next decade, also requires them to raise $1 billion in new taxes somewhere else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is wrong on policy. It is wrong on job creation. It is wrong on tax hikes. I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has spoken passionately about the jobs in his district, and I look forward to working with him on economic revitalization issues so vitally important to rural areas like the ones he and I both represent. But this is really not a jobs program before us. What is the best way for taxpayers to have collected what they owed? We want to collect what we are owed. We believe for every IRS employee, we are going to collect $20. For every private debt collector,  the optimistic projection is you are going to collect $4. The reality has been much less than that. So when we are talking about the issue before us, what is the best way to get the money we are owed? The best way to do it is hire the personnel, train the personnel, run an IRS capable of getting its job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Nevada, Congresswoman Berkley.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400024" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Tax Collection Responsibility Act. This bill will prevent the IRS from using private debt collectors to collect Federal income taxes when current contracts have expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private debt collectors have proven to be very poorly equipped for the job. This change is important to protect taxpayers' privacy. Coming from Las Vegas, I have never been a great fan of the IRS. IRS abuse in Las Vegas is legendary. The only thing worse are private debt collectors that have harassed, threatened and intimidated the taxpayers in my district and throughout the United States to collect back taxes and to also collect a hefty fee. The IRS ought to do its job of collecting taxes and  Congress ought to do our job by giving them the resources the IRS needs to do its job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also proposes implementation of a 3 percent withholding requirement on government payments to vendors. This requirement will cause significant administrative and financial burdens on local governments. As a local government that spends more than $100 million per year on vendor products and services, Clark County, Nevada, would be required to withhold 3 percent of payments to businesses. Under the new requirement, companies that contract with local government would be terribly and unfairly  penalized. This could result, it will result in cash flow problems for small businesses and ultimately higher prices for all consumers. This bill will postpone the 3 percent withholding requirement to give the Treasury Department time to study the impact of this provision on local governments and taxpayers before it is implemented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation for both reasons that I have stated.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would point out that while the claim has been made that our taxpayers have been harassed, IRS itself has testified there is a 97 percent satisfaction rate with the process that is already in place with these private collection agencies. I must point out, too, that while a claim is made that past Congresses starved the IRS, the truth is actually the opposite. The agency last year added over 200 new field collection personnel. This year's budget will add even  more agents to the IRS. This program that is being sought to be eliminated has already generated almost $6 million for more IRS agents in a collection agency.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At this time, I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the bill's prime sponsor, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his long-time efforts on behalf of fair treatment for taxpayers in this country. I rise in strong support of this legislation, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to endorsing the practices that this bill provides for better collection and fairer collection for small businesses, I also believe it is high time we repeal an abusive and misguided debt collection program at the IRS. I am pleased to have worked on this issue for a number of years with my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman) and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we all know that it is not a new issue to this body. We tried private tax collection in 1996 and promptly abandoned it a year later, after which time the IRS Office of Inspector General found that private contractors regularly violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, jeopardized the confidentiality of taxpayers personal information, and cost the government a net revenue loss of $17 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Republican Congress, this program was revived and came to the floor actually in a form that we did not have a chance to vote separately on it, because when the House has had an opportunity over the last 3 years to vote separately on this issue, this body on a bipartisan basis has said no to private debt collection. That bill never made it to the President's desk. But there is a good reason this House has said no to this program. That is because IRS officials themselves have acknowledged  that using private debt collectors is much more expensive than having the IRS do the job. Today on the program that we are talking about, the IRS has spent $71 million and collected a net of $20 million. That is a losing proposition on its face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, in her testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, the National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson, whose job at the IRS is to look out for the fair treatment of taxpayers, recommended that we end this program and further pointed out, as others have said, that if you took the same amount of money and invested it in allowing IRS agents to collect the revenue, you would collect $1.4 billion instead of the $20 million collected so far in this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, and I think this is an important point to make, when this Congress in the 1990s passed the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, we specifically said that our public employees, our IRS agents, could not receive bonuses, could not receive special rewards for collecting more taxes because we want to avoid an incentive for abuse; yet that is exactly the premise this entire program is based on. It is based on bigger rewards in the sense for more taxes collected. That is what leads in turn  to abusive tax practices that we have said we don't want our IRS agents to comply. In addition to the fact, the result is for every dollar collected under the private tax collection, 25 cents goes to a private company; whereas, with IRS agents, that dollar collected goes to the Federal Treasury for debt reduction and for investment in important public purposes. So it is a much better return for the taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would argue, Mr. Speaker, that it is very clear over the years that our repeated experiments in private debt collection have failed. If the IRS needs additional resources to collect uncollected revenues, and I think it does, we have heard from the IRS Commissioners in Republican and Democratic administrations alike, that a much better investment is to put those dollars into our public IRS agents. It results in less abusive practices. It makes sure that you also have the dollars come back where  it belongs to the taxpayer and the public benefit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would point out it is difficult to have an abusive program when there is 97 percent customer satisfaction and zero privacy violations and zero Fair Debt Collection Act violations. Zero. I point out as far as efficiency, you don't have to take anyone's word on this floor if this program is working. Attached to this bill is testimony that says eliminating it will cost the U.S. taxpayers $1 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So you don't have to take our word for it. The experts who are independent, who have looked at this issue, know this is an efficient program for the U.S. taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MR. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, our information is somewhat different from the information just propounded. We believe indeed the record would show there have been 83 complaints. These complaints include taxpayers who have  received letters with another taxpayer's information inside. Now, if this isn't a taxpayer privacy violation, I don't know what is. At least one fine has been assessed, and this is in the early going of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will acknowledge perfection is a pretty hard standard to meet, but they have not met perfection and they have not generated the money in collection that was advertised at the beginning of this endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to my friend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman), who has long had concerns about this initiative and worked hard to end it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400346" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from North Dakota for all his wonderful work on this. I want to thank Mr. Van Hollen. I want to thank my chairman on the appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Serrano, and so many people who were so outraged at this private collection of taxpayer money that is owed to the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, here's the problem. About $300 billion is owed to the American taxpayers by those income earners who refuse to pay their taxes. They admit they owe the money, but they refuse to pay. That is about $300 billion. That is the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what is the solution to the problem? Well, the Republicans here say, let's privatize this, give it to private people, private companies who will make a profit on collecting these tax moneys, and they will collect about $4 for every $1 we spend on them. They will collect $4. The other solution is to hire more IRS agents, and for every $1 we invest in them, we will get $20. Not the $4 that goes to the private debt collectors that they produce, but $20. We will collect five times more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why would we give away the taxpayers' money by letting private debt collectors collect our debts, just so we can collect five times less? They say, "Well, we don't want to support big government." Well, do they want to waste all those tens or hundreds of billions of dollars by giving it to private debt collectors to collect at five times less effectiveness? It makes no sense. But this is nothing new.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, they wanted to privatize Social Security. They privatized the prescription drug program for seniors. They wanted to privatize the collection of our mail. They wanted to privatize, and they did, security contracting in Iraq, There is Halliburton, Blackwater. And they did so at Walter Reed Army Hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this ideology of the Republican Party and this President that we need to privatize everything doesn't make sense, it wastes taxpayer dollars, and in fact is an opportunity for a very select few in our society to profit at the expense of everybody else. Not only is it un-American, it is wasteful, it is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we can do better with this solution. That is why I have been fighting for this for years, and I am so proud to support <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>. If they say the choice is do nothing or something, do it the right way and pass <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would point out that private debt collection is used by 40 different States, whose Governors are Republican and Democrat, and thousands of local government agencies and organizations, again, both Republican and Democrat. This isn't an issue of privatization, it is an issue of efficiency. This partnership between the IRS and private debt collectors for this group of taxpayers who are hard to collect those taxes from will yield an additional $1 billion for the  American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as part of the IRS appropriation, we fund the National Taxpayer Advocate. In her 2006 annual report, she writes, "We are concerned that private collectors are using trickery, device and belated Fair Debt Collection Practices Act warnings to take advantage of taxpayers. We are concerned private collectors are taking advantage of taxpayers." That is from the National Taxpayer Advocate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), who has advanced the prohibition of this ill-advised endeavor in the Appropriations Committee.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400366" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this has to be one of the worst ideas ever put forth. Just think of it: Instead of getting the IRS to collect the tax dollars, we go and tell someone else that they can collect 24 cents on the dollar, instead of hiring more folks to collect what they have been doing for so many years. So we lose 24 cents on every dollar, rather than have someone take care of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the IRS has spent $71 million in money we have given them on this program and have collected in return somewhere between $20 and $25 million. The IRS Taxpayer Advocate, as was mentioned by the gentleman, calculated that if this money had been spent by the IRS to collect, they would have collected $1.4 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have also heard here about the harassment tactics. Now, we can deny it as much as we would like, but when you give me an incentive of 24 cents on the dollar to collect from taxpayers, things can get out of hand. That is why senior citizens have been called 150 times in a month's time, looking for their son. My friends, these kind of tactics would make a great comeback episode for "The Sopranos," and I think one might be in the works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the IRS can do this work. We tried to do this, as you know, in our committee, and it was defeated, basically with the minority party saying on a point of order they would pull it out of the bill. But it was our intent to do that in our bill. In addition, we put in $400 million in fiscal year 2008. With this funding, the IRS should be able to start working on these cases themselves, without outsourcing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know, as Mr. Rothman has said, that there is a madness in this House about taking everything that American workers do and sending it somewhere else, overseas usually, and then what government employees do, they send it to another agency or to somebody else. I can't wait for the day when you decide that the whole Congress should be outsourced overseas and we should have people doing our work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a bad idea. We should pass this bill and stop this program immediately.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would remind the Chamber that more than 40 States, not just this administration, more than 40 States, Democrat Governors and Republican Governors, use the exact same type of collection techniques, the same partnerships, to do what is right for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out that we have heard claims today of literally tens of thousands of people who have been harassed by these private debt collectors, all the abuses. I would simply challenge you to name one. In this debate today, name one. Name the person, name the case where there was a privacy abuse or thousands of harassing phone calls. I would predict there will be no name mentioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would just again read from the National Taxpayer Advocate report: "We are concerned private collectors are taking advantage of taxpayers." I will submit this for the Record.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412232" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill for three reasons. First is the cost. As my colleagues have previously said, we should have raised from these private agencies at least $44 million to $63 million to date. In fact, it has only been $25 million, with a sum cost of $51 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second is the more cost-effective way that another agency, the IRS, might do this. We know that they have collected this year alone $5.3 million from the Automated Call Service. Imagine if we had not decreased the number of IRS officers from 8,500 during the nineties down to only 5,200 today and we had put the money into them or into the Automated Call Service. That 20-to-1 return that the government gets far exceeds the 4-to-1 return of private agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, however, after 31 years in the military, it pained me to see us outsource our security operations to  private agencies in Iraq. At times there is abuse, not dissimilar to what we hear today, such as seniors and those in Iraq being called. In fact, a senior couple was called 150 times, five times a day. Then we learned they had the wrong number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I therefore rise in support of this bill because of the cost-effectiveness of the IRS and because of the abuses that can occur if it is not within a government agency.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would point out that attached to the majority's bill that this House is considering today, according to the majority's bill, the Joint Tax Group testifies and asserts that this program, that is working today, will collect $1 billion more. You can hear every claim you want on this House floor, but their own bill says to the American public that this program will collect $1 billion more than if it were to be eliminated. That is not at dispute today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the cost cited assumes that not a nickel is spent on IRS capacity. Indeed, if we spend it on IRS capacity, the unrefuted evidence is that it would be a 5-to-1 return relative to private collectors.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400338" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this won't be the first or last time that debate on the floor comes on disagreements of policy or well-crafted rhetoric that goes to the extreme of bringing forth one's position. But I think that my colleague, Mr. Brady, and others who have spoken in the aspect that private collection has worked in the portion that has been assigned in their mission as they get underway, that the complexity of collecting taxes of the tax gap, which, if you recognize the tax  gap as a challenge of revenue, one that this Congress very quickly and gladly put forth, that $1 billion of collections through private collection agencies would be achieved, and as we now embark on that, we have listened to tough language and rhetoric, and I sat through most of those public hearings, crafting today the reflection of what they thought they heard</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we measure in the future the work that has been done that has been assigned to the PCAs, and we look at the aspect of a goal that all of us would have, that the IRS has tools to do their job so that collection continues, I think we will also see in short time that private collection agencies have done the mission they were asked to do in the pilot out in Iowa and in western New York, and I think as we give that a chance, not only will this legislation not be needed, but it will not see  the light of day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman has 1 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be brief, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hear a lot of claims today about the efficiency of this program. But our agencies, the independent agencies, the Government Accountability Office and Joint Tax, make the point attached to this legislation that this program has worked, is working efficiently, and will save U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You will hear today about abuses. But the fact of the matter is they can name not one in any independent agency, including the IRS, the Treasury. Examination of the program has showed 97 percent customer satisfaction, zero privacy violations, and zero Fair Debt Collection Act violations, zero, no matter what is talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is, the question before us today is not about privatization. This is about credibility. This majority has talked about closing the tax gap, what is owed and what is paid. Yet today we will widen that tax gap by over $1 billion. So the question is will we walk the walk, or just talk the talk about the tax gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This partnership between the IRS and these private collection agencies is working for the American public. We ought to let it continue to work for the American public, because we can use that $1 billion for health care, for education, for helping our veterans, for a number of important priorities in this budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And we will have some type of a financial standoff here in a few months, yet we let $1 billion escape our grasp. I urge a "no" vote on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we believe private debt collection of IRS debt is a terrible idea and an important matter, which is why the majority leader will close for our side. I yield the balance of our time to the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, from Maryland.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let me respond to a point Mr. Brady has made a number of times. The point I am referring to is if we did not spend any money on private collection, we would not collect $1 billion. We can accept that as accurate. But the assumption is that we wouldn't spend any money in the public sector to collect that money. But I will read figures that say if we did that, we would geometrically collect more than a billion dollars by a factor of two or three or four or five. I will read that  figure, Mr. Brady. But you keep reading the figure, the assumption of which is we are simply going to drop collection. We are not going to drop collection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, through this important legislation, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act, this House will reiterate that the collection of taxes is a core governmental function that should not be contracted out to private companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But no one, no one should be mistaken. Our objection to the private collection of taxes is not simply philosophical; it is practical, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, there simply is no evidence that private tax collectors are more efficient. In fact, the opposite is true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>IRS Commissioners of both parties repeatedly have testified before Congress that IRS employees could do this work more efficiently. In fact, according to the IRS, the return on investment for IRS employees doing work similar to private collection agencies is 13:1. The private collection agency return is about 4:1, or approximately one-third as effective in the private sector as it is in the public sector. That is what the IRS Commissioners say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, with Americans legitimately concerned about the privacy of their personal information and identity theft, I don't believe, and I hope this House does not believe, that it is good policy to turn over Social Security identification numbers and tax information to private collection companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the National Taxpayer Advocate has raised concerns about the tactics used by private collection agencies, including intimidation and harassment. The fact is that private tax collectors are keeping 21 to 24 percent of what they collect, and are allowed to keep up to 25 percent under the law. Thus, with the compensation of private collection agencies directly tied to what they collect, they are incentivized to use aggressive tactics. Ironically, however, and let me go back to that figure,  they are less effective in collecting, 13-to-1 versus 4-to-1, than the public sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me say too many of my Republican friends want it both ways. On the one hand, Republican-controlled Congresses have cut the IRS workforce by 20,000 people since 1995. In fact, just this year they offered an amendment to the Financial Services Appropriations bill that would cut IRS funding by 8.9 percent; yet they come to the floor and say we are not aggressively collecting sufficient funds so we have to privatize it, contract it out. That expense, of course, is an additional expense,  which, by the way, escalates more rapidly than does the public sector expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, they complain that we must allow the government to hire private collection agencies because the IRS does not have the resources to recover all income tax that is owed. So  on the one hand, cut their resources, and then come to the floor and say they don't have sufficient resources to do the job so we will contract it out, which will require, of course, contract resources while eliminating salary resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we all know the most effective solution: We need to provide the IRS with the resources it needs to ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share under the law, so that no taxpayer has to pay more than their fair share or have rates greater than they need to be, which would be the case if everybody paid their fair share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is an important step in that effort. I urge all of my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to vote for this important bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the authority of the Internal Revenue Service to use private debt collection companies, to delay implementation of withholding taxes on Government contractors, to revise the tax rules on expatriation, and for other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin by thanking the gentleman from New York, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, CHARLES RANGEL, for including language to address the question of the statute of limitations for residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know Mr. Speaker, residents of the Virgin Islands, as citizens of the United States, are required to pay Federal income tax like any other citizen living outside the United States. However, section 932 of the Internal Revenue Code, "Code", states that bona fide residents of the Virgin Islands are not required filing an income tax return with the IRS. Instead, they are required to file their income tax return with, and pay the applicable tax to, the government of the Virgin Islands. The  amount of the liability to the Virgin Islands, determined under the "mirror code" system, in most cases is exactly the same amount that they would otherwise have been required to pay to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to concerns that some U.S. citizens claimed tax benefits who neither lived nor worked in the Territory, Congress tightened the income and residency rules of the Virgin Islands Economic Development Commission, EDC, program as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service subsequently initiated a comprehensive series of audits not only of individuals who participated in the Territory's EDC program, but also many taxpayers who had moved years earlier to the Virgin Islands and who did not participate in the EDC program as well as taxpayers who were born in the Virgin Islands but who had spent periods of their working life outside the Territory due to the lack of opportunities in the Virgin Islands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the course of these audits, the IRS reversed its long-standing administrative practice and published position, and now claims that the statute of limitations never runs for V.I. taxpayers who reasonably and in good faith file their tax returns with, and pay their tax to, the Virgin Islands Bureau of Internal Revenue, "BIR", as the law requires them to do. In a General Counsel Advisory Memorandum, the IRS announced its new position that it has the right to audit the returns of a V.I. taxpayer  as far back as they like and, if the IRS determines under the subjective pre-Jobs Act test that the taxpayer was not a bona fide V.I. resident, that it can assess full tax and penalties even if the taxpayer has paid the correct amount to the Virgin Islands. Because the Virgin Islands statute of limitations will have run in many of these circumstances, the taxpayer will be precluded</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today would end this heavy handed and unfair practice and treat bona fide U.S. Virgin Islands residents who files a return in the territory in the same manner as if the return were an income tax return filed with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support adoption of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill but must oppose the effort to add a provision dealing with the estate tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long supported reform of the estate tax, not its complete repeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we should change it in a way that will strike the right balance, protecting family-owned ranches, farms, and other small businesses while recognizing the need for fiscal responsibility in a time of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the motion to recommit would have simply added to the bill a permanent repeal of the estate tax. I do not support that and cannot vote for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I can and will vote for the underlying bill, which will repeal the use of private debt collection companies to collect Federal income taxes, delay the application of an onerous 3 percent withholding requirement on Government payments, and discourage individuals who renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid paying taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="695">H.R. 695</bill>, the Taxpayer Abuse and Harassment Prevention Act of 2007. Like the bill now before the House, it would amend the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into contracts with private collection agencies to collect unpaid taxes. I support that because of the numerous instances in which private collection agencies have been guilty of taxpayer harassment, abusive calling, and violations of taxpayer rights, the Fair Debt  Collection Act, and taxpayer return disclosure protections. I understand that right now the Federal Trade Commission has 130 complaints likely to involve the private tax debt contractors, and the Taxpayer Advocate has many more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> would delay until December 31, 2011, the application of a recently-enacted provision requiring withholding of 3 percent of the value of government payments to contractors and small businesses for goods and services. Local governments from across Colorado have contacted me to urge that the requirement be repealed--and while this delay falls short of that, it will provide additional time for Congress to consider repeal or drastic revision of the requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill would impose an immediate tax on individuals who renounce their U.S. citizenship in order to avoid paying their taxes and enact a scaled-back version of the Treasury Department's proposal to increase penalties on failures by independent contractors to provide Form 1099 information returns. I think these are reasonable and appropriate provisions that deserve support.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Act of 2007. This legislation will amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the authority of the Internal Revenue Service to use private debt collection companies, to delay implementation of withholding taxes on Government contractors, to revise the tax rules on expatriation, and for other purposes. I would like to thank my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,  Mr. RANGEL, for introducing this legislation, as well as for his leadership in bringing this important issue to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation strengthens Government accountability and protects taxpayers and confidential tax information. It will repeal the IRS's authority to enter into, renew, or extend contracts with private companies to collect Federal income taxes. Currently, the private debt collection program exposes taxpayers to harassment, wastes tax dollars by paying a bounty of up to 24 percent to debt collectors, and jeopardizes long-term taxpayer compliance. The collection of Federal income taxes  is an inherently governmental function that should be restricted to IRS employees. Furthermore, the use of private contractors violates the special and confidential relationship between taxpayers and the Federal Government, and could jeopardize the privacy of taxpayers, possibly undermining long-term taxpayer compliance. In addition, private debt collection is an extremely inefficient way to collect Federal income taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the authority to enter into private debt collection contracts was first granted in 2004, the Federal Government has spent $71 million to collect a net of $20 million in tax receipts. If this money was spent hiring IRS employees, the National Taxpayer Advocate estimates the Federal Government could have collected $1.4 billion. This provision is estimated to cost $1.054 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this legislation delays the application of the withholding requirement on certain governmental payments for goods and services. For payments made after December 31, 2010, the Code requires withholding at a 3 percent rate on certain payments to persons providing property or services made by Federal, State, and local governments. The withholding is required regardless of whether the government entity making the payment is the recipient of the property or services, those with less than</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation stops the tax benefits for expatriates who renounce their citizenship. U.S. citizens and long-term U.S.  residents are subject to tax on their worldwide income. Taxpayers can avoid taxes by renouncing their U.S. citizenship or terminating their residence. It would immediately impose a tax on these individuals, strengthening current law to ensure that certain high net-worth taxpayers cannot renounce their U.S. citizenship  or terminate U.S. residence in order to avoid paying taxes. Under this provision, high net-worth individuals will be treated as if they sold all of their property for its fair market value on the day before such individual expatriates or terminates their residency. Gain will be recognized to the extent that the aggregate gain recognized exceeds $600,000, which will be adjusted for cost of living in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill> increases information return penalties. This provision would increase the penalties for failing to file correct returns, failing to furnish correct payee statements, and failing to comply with other information reporting requirements. If a taxpayer fails to file a correct information return before August 1, current law imposes a $50 penalty. This bill would increase this penalty to $100 per information return, with a maximum penalty of $600,000 per calendar year, $250,000 in  the case of small businesses. Where a taxpayer files a correct information return after the filing date but before 30 days after the filing date, the current law $15 penalty will be increased to $25, with a maximum penalty of $200,000 per calendar year, $75,000 in the case of small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where a taxpayer files a correct information return more than 30 days after the filing date but before August 1, the penalty for information returns will be increased from $30 to $60, with a maximum penalty of $500,000, $150,000 in the case of small businesses. The provision is a scaled-back version of the Treasury Department's proposal to increase penalties on failures to provide information returns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we can reduce the tax gap and make sure that taxpayers pay their fair share by having the IRS collect unpaid Federal taxes compared to private debt collectors. The American people demanded a new direction for America in the 2006 elections, and I believe that Congress must stand up for the American taxpayer. The current program's practice of giving unaccountable private contractors unfettered access to the personal financial data of American citizens poses an unnecessary and unacceptable  risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007. Among other provisions, this bill would repeal the authority of the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, to use private debt collection companies to collect overdue taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to voice my support for an initiative being led by Senator BEN NELSON of Nebraska to provide disabled veterans and persons with disabilities with gainful employment as tax collectors. The Disability Preference Program for Tax Collection Contracts would give an incentive to private collection companies to employ people with disabilities. Despite the pending repeal of these debt collecting contracts by the IRS, I sincerely believe this initiative can provide immediate benefits  to people with disabilities and be used as a model program for other services and industries to encourage similar hires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after enactment of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, complete repeal of private debt collection authority would still take a couple of years while the existing private contracts expire. In that time, Sen. NELSON's initiative could provide disabled Americans invaluable training and experience to help continue their careers in similar services, likely with the same debt collecting company or even with the IRS. Since much of the same background scrutiny in hiring and job training are used for both the debt  collection companies and the IRS, these disabled Americans would have an advantage for employment in the IRS. Additionally, under current Federal law, the disabled veterans would have right of first refusal to become IRS collectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The extraordinarily large number of returning disabled veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are facing new, unexpected challenges to restoring their lives in America. These disabled veterans face an unemployment rate three times that of the general population. After their personal and their families' sacrifices for their country, it is Congress's responsibility to open doors to the largest number of jobs for the disabled, and these debt collecting jobs are exceptionally suited for people with disabilities.  Even multiple amputees returning from Iraq, with only a high school education and expecting their career is over, could easily perform and excel in this profession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while I do not generally support the privatization of Federal tax collecting, I applaud Senator BEN NELSON's initiative to provide career paths for disabled veterans and people with severe disabilities.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400310" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a proposal that would be impacted by the repeal of the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, program to collect unpaid taxes. The Disability Preference Program for Tax Collection Contracts is an initiative championed by the Senator from Nebraska, BEN NELSON. It would give an incentive to private third-party collection companies to hire people with severe disabilities and give them high-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Disability Preference Program is worth supporting even under the assumption that the IRS contracting law should later be repealed. A closer look at the Disability Preference Program and the repeal of current IRS contracting law clearly shows that the two are not mutually exclusive. Until such time as a repeal is passed, workers with disabilities (including service disabled veterans) employed by contractors are gaining valuable vocational training and work experience on-the-job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Disabled veterans and other disabled workers would most likely "retain employment" with the contractor through reassignment to another project within the company if the IRS contract were to expire or be terminated. Private sector collection contractors strive to lower attrition and training costs by reassigning exiting staff as projects are gained and lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, employees assigned to the IRS contract work at the private collection contractor must pass the same level of scrutiny and background checks as IRS employees, and undergo IRS-approved project training and testing. Therefore, contractor employees will be the "best available applicants for job opportunities with the IRS" when the IRS hires internal collectors to do the work before or after repeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Disability Preference Program, disabled workers would receive valuable training, certification, and job experience to seek gainful employment at private sector or government offices performing telephone collection work, and therefore would be much "better qualified and prepared to continue a career" in the collection industry than they otherwise would have been if the program was not available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although even for a temporary time period, use of this employment initiative will provide a much needed demonstration to government contracting entities that similar contracting requirements should be used to provide good job opportunities for disabled veterans and other persons with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support enactment of the Disability Preference Program for Tax Collection Contracts.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in general support for <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, which as a primary mission puts a stop to the harassing nature of private tax collection on a targeted group of American citizens, those least responsible for the ever-growing tax gap problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I rise to speak in particular about section 3 of the Chairman's mark which delays implementation of the 3 percent withholding requirement made by section of 511 of last year's Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, also known as TIPRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 511 requires all levels of government with at least $100 million in annual procurements to withhold 3 percent of payment on most procurement contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Conference Report for the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 states that section 511 would impose an intergovernmental mandate not previously considered by either the House or the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The costs of this mandate on government would likely exceed the $64 million threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act for public-sector mandates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The costs of this mandate would also likely exceed the annual $128 million threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act for private-sector mandates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned this provision will seriously impact small businesses that routinely provide goods and services to the Federal, State and local governments, and those governments themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, withholding 3 percent of payments to a primary contractor could hamper cash flows needed to meet operating expenses, pay suppliers or subcontractors, or meet payroll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any loss of small business involvement in government contracting is likely to have a negative effect on government costs associated with procurement contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The withholding requirement would also create a new financial burden on the local governments responsible for administering withholding and forwarding these types of payments to the IRS, both in the increased need for new software and manpower, and in the likely increase in contract values as businesses seek to pass the 3 percent on to their government clients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 3 percent withholding was originally approved in an effort to narrow the "tax gap." Like most, I believe that Congress should ferret out non-compliance to the best of our ability. Still, efforts to bridge the "tax gap" should  be weighed first against the potential for "collateral damage to honest taxpayers and local governments."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Annual procurements by Federal, State, and local governments add up to hundreds of billions of dollars, yet a one year delay, as mandated in the legislation before us, costs only $44 million, hardly the amount that would be expected if there was rampant noncompliance among contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language also requires the Department of the Treasury to study the negative affects that section 511 would have and report those to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are too many questions left unanswered to go forward with the implementation of section 511, questions that we have a pretty good idea of the answers to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud and thank my Chairman, Congressman RANGEL, for giving this issue a spotlight on a bill that is of high priority to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that this is a starting point to full repeal of section 511 and with the continued grassroots support from the Government Withholding Coalition of private industry and the many public sector groups like the National Association of Counties, I feel confident that we will find the Ways and the Means to do away with this onerous requirement.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400190" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer this motion to recommit to the underlying bill, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion to recommit would actually incorporate <bill type="h" number="2380">H.R. 2380</bill>, which is a bill for which I am the original sponsor. It is a bipartisan bill, and I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, especially those who have cosponsored the bill, would see fit to support this motion to recommit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since I have these few moments, and I see the distinguished chairman of the committee who may be responding, let me anticipate some points or questions perhaps and try to respond to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may hear the question: Why are we doing the death tax repeal now?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, three times in the last session of Congress did we have the opportunity to debate this issue and vote on it. Again, this House in a bipartisan fashion voted to completely, permanently repeal the death tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not certain under the new majority that we will have that opportunity or not. There is a policy rationale for considering this measure now. One is the certainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Speaker knows, right now there is a $2 million exemption, a 45 percent rate, a very punitive rate. That exemption in 2010 goes up to a complete repeal, and there is lack of certainty, especially those family businesses that are looking to plan on how to dispose of those assets. So I think now is an appropriate time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may hear from my good friend, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is this bill paid for. And I would suggest first of all that there is no budgetary impact in fiscal year 2009. We are looking beyond January 1, 2011, before any budgetary impact. And I would quote the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who at least has been quoted in the paper as saying he is ready to tackle some big, tough issues, like the alternative minimum tax. The permanent death tax repeal is significantly  less loss of revenue to the government than repealing the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has talked about fairness and equity. I can think of nothing fairer than to get rid of this very punitive tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may hear from the other side, as traditionally we do, this is something that only a handful of individuals face, or that this is for millionaires only. My rejoinder to that is then why is every small business group in America, whether it be the National Federation of Independent Business, whether it be every business group that represents minority interests, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the African American Chamber of Commerce in the past, all have supported complete repeal, final repeal  of this very punitive tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk a little bit about the values of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the land of opportunity, is it not? The old adage is, if you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door. The only thing guaranteed, of course, in America is the guarantee of freedom and liberty and the opportunity to achieve whatever it is you dream about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you a very personal story of a dream of a young couple. A young, strapping man left home in 1956 with his new bride in tow. They had $1,000 to their name. That is what his father had given him to go make his way into the world. And so they settled in Mrs. Emerson's district in southeast Missouri, and they worked very hard to build a farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of those many years, this couple had a son, an only son. That individual is the one the Chair has recognized here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They built this family business, a family-owned farm, 500 acres, three tractors, a used combine, the farmhouse where I grew up. And so it was, of course, the unfortunate reality of life, and that is we meet our heavenly reward. My dad passed on the anniversary of John F. Kennedy's death on November 22, 5 years ago this November. Mom survived another 17 months after that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sitting there across the mahogany desk from our old, long-time family accountant who had an old adding machine with a tape in it, and he is plugging in a value for all of these assets that my parents had already been taxed on, whose assets were to help put food on the table. Suddenly I broke out in a cold sweat because I knew when he hit the total button, that figure was going to be above or below an arbitrary line, a line set by this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, death of a family member should not be a taxable event, and the fact is if Congress fails to do anything with the current regime, virtually every small business in America in 2011 is going to be facing this very punitive tax. I urge an "aye" vote on the motion to recommit.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my friend is an articulate and forceful advocate. And we are all moved by the story of his time with the accountant, but they did not owe a tax. And basically, there is a figure missing from the motion to recommit he brings before us today, a very important figure: the cost of what the underlying motion to recommit would require. That figure is $498.8 billion. Now, we are a Nation of $9 trillion of debt, $9 trillion of debt, and they bring forward a proposal that would  add another $498.8 billion, and they fail to say anything about how they are going to pay for it in their motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, obviously serious-minded legislators like my friend would not bring forward a serious proposal about repeal of the estate tax without some means of paying for it, and that is really what the heart of this motion is. It is not a real estate tax motion. This is a kill-the-underlying-bill motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other side has some different priorities. Last week they were against SCHIP, expanding health insurance to uninsured kids. This week they are basically for privatizing debt collection of IRS debt. You like what Blackwater is doing in Iraq; you're going to love sending IRS debt to private bill collectors here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Because they aren't going to prevail on the debate itself, they want to keep the vote from happening at all, which is what the underlying motion to recommit does, sends it promptly back to the Ways and Means Committee, which means the underlying bill is not before the House for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to further use the time in our opposition to the motion to recommit, it is my honor to yield to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel from New York.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to hear the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof) who's an outstanding member of the Ways and Means Committee and I appreciate his contribution to the committee. I was moved by his story of the hardship that he felt as a result of the estate tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the heck that has got to do with collecting debts that is owed to the Internal Revenue, I have no idea. If you're suggesting that we kill the bill that eliminates bounty hunters from working on commission and unfairly leaning and putting pressure on people who owe the Federal Government, that's one thing. If you want us to just substitute that and take back to the committee your idea about what we should do with the estate tax, well, you know as well as I do that we have to find out how  much money do we lose, where do we raise the money, and do it in a Republican-Democratic fiscal fashion to say, hey, I want to reduce taxes here and raise it someplace else, maybe on the kids, maybe on a little tobacco, maybe whatever makes you feel good, but don't kill something with a parliamentary motion. It's not the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the subject matter that you discuss does warrant some discussion, someplace, at some time, but to imply that we should report back promptly, how promptly should we deal with the question of estate tax or estate tax repeal? Where do we get the half a billion dollars? These are things that I think should be in another day and another time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, we're talking about a great bill that if you kill this bill through a parliamentary procedure, which is all we're talking about, then the small business people that have been collecting government taxes, they're going to get hit. The citizens that we have in the Virgin Islands that are treated unfairly with the statute of limitations, they're going to get hit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the people who really believe that if you have to deal with your government, if you have to deal with the Treasury Department, if you have to deal with the Internal Revenue, for God's sake, deal with a civil servant whose mortgage payment is not dependent on how much money he can get out of you. Deal with someone that's been trained by the United States Government to collect money that's owed to the United States Government and not some company that has been created to fill the need because  some people believe that the private sector can always but always do it best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do hope that when the committee has something to discuss as important as estate tax, why not discuss estate tax when it's time to do it.</paragraph>
