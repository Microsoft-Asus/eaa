  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as of this month, it has been 2 full years that the position of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior has been vacant--2 full years. There has been a Federal position specifically assigned for the responsibilities for Indian affairs since the year 1806.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the year 1849, that position was transferred from the Defense Department--or then the Department of War--to the Interior Department. The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior is responsible for managing the BIA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and all of the programs that are important to the trust responsibilities and the fiduciary obligations the U.S. Government has to tribes. We do indeed have obligations to tribes through treaties and through other approaches,  trust responsibilities. This Congress, and previous Congresses, and future Congresses, have obligations to tribal governments that we must meet. Those obligations are important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, it has been 2 full years since we have had a person in the position of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs in the Interior Department. For 2 years it has been vacant, which is unbelievable to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a man who has been nominated now named Carl Artman, who is a member of the United Tribe of Wisconsin. Mr. Artman is a very capable, distinguished person. I met with him a couple times. President Bush sent his nomination down to the Congress last year. Apparently, a hold was put on his nomination and it did not move. The President re-sent the nomination recently. I chaired the hearing, and we moved his nomination out of the Indian Affairs Committee and now it is before the full Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My understanding is it has not moved because there has been a hold put on it once again. I spoke to the Secretary of the Interior today again about that subject, and my hope is--I indicated to him, and I think his hope is--this week we can find a way to resolve these issues and get Mr. Carl Artman confirmed by the Senate for the position of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. It is a very important position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a full-blown crisis in health care, housing, and education on Indian reservations. I have been doing listening sessions with Indian tribes. With respect to education, as an example, they tell about a young schoolkid who is living in a house, a 3-bedroom home with 23 people. That describes the housing conditions on some of the reservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what about a young kid who is living in a 3-bedroom home with 23 other people? What kind of homework do you think gets done there? What kind of opportunity is it for that young child to quietly be able to open a book and to learn a lesson?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a crisis in housing. I have described it many times on the floor of the Senate. We have a crisis in health care. It is almost unbelievable to me, but we had a hearing recently in which a doctor described a woman who had a very serious knee injury who required surgery. She went to the doctor on the Indian reservation and was told: Wrap it in cabbage leaves for 3 or 4 days. That is right: Wrap it in cabbage leaves for 3 or 4 days. It needed to be operated on. It was a torn ligament. "Wrap  it in cabbage leaves"--that is health care? Not where I come from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or a man who had a bad arm, a bad shoulder, a torn ligament, and for 4 years he could not get it fixed on the Indian reservation because it was not "life or limb"--4 years. This was a rancher. What do you think a one-armed rancher is able to do on a ranch? Haul hay? I do not think so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told the story on the floor about the woman who was having a heart attack--an Indian woman--and was transported by ambulance to a hospital. She was hauled into the hospital on a gurney--having a heart attack--and they discovered there was a piece of paper taped to her thigh. What the paper said was: You should understand, hospital administrators, this person is not covered under the Indian Contract Health Services. We are out of money. So, therefore, if you admit this person, you are on your  own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine that: a woman having a heart attack, brought in on a gurney to a hospital with a piece of paper taped to her thigh that says: Beware. We won't pay for this treatment. That is unbelievable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of problems we need to address in these areas dealing with Indian tribes and the first Americans. I understand the Indian Health Service is attached to Health and Human Services. But I also understand the issues of housing, education, and all of the other related issues belong to the Interior Department. That position in the Interior Department responsible for these issues has been vacant for 2 full years, and I believe it is shameful. I hope this Senate, this week, can resolve  this issue and get it done. I am going to push to see if we can't get that confirmation done this week.</paragraph>
