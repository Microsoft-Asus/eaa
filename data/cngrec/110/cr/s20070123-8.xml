    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me focus my remarks on the second cloture vote that will occur tomorrow. Were cloture to be invoked on what is generally referred to as a "clean minimum wage," the bipartisan compromise that has been put together between Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley and Senator Enzi and others would be wiped out. So I think it is extremely important to mention to Members, those who would like to continue to go forward on a bipartisan  basis, if cloture were to be invoked, that would eliminate the possibility of going forward on a bipartisan basis on minimum wage. I hope cloture will not be invoked--the second cloture vote would not be invoked, so that we can proceed with the substitute, which seems to enjoy broad, bipartisan support in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
