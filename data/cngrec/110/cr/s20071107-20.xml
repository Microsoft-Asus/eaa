  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="CONGRATULATING WILLIAM PRESCOTT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I congratulate William Prescott Elementary School, in Scranton, PA, on receiving the prestigious Blue Ribbon Schools award from the Department of Education for its outstanding achievement in providing students with a first-rate education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William Prescott Elementary School serves just fewer than 300 students from the east side of Scranton and is part of the Scranton School District. Like many schools throughout Scranton and all of Pennsylvania, William Prescott Elementary School strives to provide the best possible opportunities and to enrich the life of each student. The administration and staff work passionately to provide a comprehensive curriculum inclusive of language arts, lab-based science, computer education, art and music  education, English as a second language, special education, as well as many other courses. For the past 13 years, and particularly during the last 3, the students at William Prescott Elementary School have demonstrated steady progress in the areas of Reading and Mathematics and have far exceeded Pennsylvania's State targets. I am proud to say that the school is truly a model of educational excellence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to this, and I believe this is key, the school actively works to involve parents and the community in the learning process. Through partnerships with community organizations such as the Head Start Program, the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, and Scranton Area Foundation, William Prescott Elementary School demonstrates its commitment to a comprehensive educational program that builds on personal responsibility, accentuates individual respect, and develops a love of learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special credit for this achievement belongs to the principal, Mr. Albert P. O'Donnell, and the teachers, for creating a safe and challenging learning environment. During my brief experience as a teacher I learned firsthand how much dedication the students, the parents, and all involved must exhibit in order to succeed at this exceptional level. It is with great pride that I congratulate William Prescott Elementary School on this outstanding achievement. I hope that their dedication and hard work  inspires both young students and those serving in the field of education alike.</paragraph>
