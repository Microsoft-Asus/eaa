  <narrative>JUDGING PEOPLE BY THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10162]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last June 6 I voted for a hate crimes bill in this session, and was proud to do it. Since that time, the black ministers association in my city has come out strongly against the hate crimes bill that provides protection to people against violent crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I addressed that group in Memphis Tuesday a week ago, and at that meeting one of the ministers got up and said to the press, "The reason we're against this bill basically is because a white man can't represent black people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent a black district. I am one of only two Members that do. I plan to represent my people, as I have, and show this country from my district in Memphis, Tennessee, that regardless of race or color, a person should be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin, and they can represent people in this country, for this is indeed one country under God, with liberty and justice for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recently celebrated in my city the 50th anniversary of the 1957 civil rights bill and will have the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. King. That event will be in Memphis, Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've come a long way, and we have a long way to go.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
