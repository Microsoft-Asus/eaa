    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I participated in one of the Petraeus-Crocker hearings. Sadly, it was just more of the same. We heard doubletalk and nuanced excuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people and the Congress demand more. This is not the punchline on some late night comedy news show. This is the blood and treasure of our Nation. And now the Administration has its hand out for another blank check, over $1 billion rumor has it. This Congress should remain firm in its opposition to an open-ended occupation which is neither making America safer nor providing any real hope for the Iraqi people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few months ago, Madam Speaker, our esteemed Appropriations Chairman, Mr. Obey, introduced, and this House passed, a bill that clearly stated the position of a majority of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With bipartisan support, the bill stated, the primary purpose of funds made available by this Act should be to transition the mission of United States Armed Forces in Iraq and undertake their redeployment and not to extend or prolong the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A line has been drawn in the sand. The bar was raised, and we will not step back from this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From so-called blue states to red states, from east coast to west, from the deep south to the midwest, on to the great plain states, people are fed up. They overwhelmingly, time after time, demand that we end our occupation of Iraq, bring our troops home and that we also bring military contractors home and reaffirm our support of the Iraqi people by funding reconstruction and reconciliation efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our assistance should come through diplomacy. Actually through a handshake, not at the point of a gun. What is the best way to help the Iraqi people? By occupying their land or by lending a hand? As I said many, many times, I represent the most beautiful and most progressive congressional district. Every day my constituents make me proud to represent such amazing people. My own community has collected supplies for the troops, has donated to aid agencies and has gone the extra distance by giving  straight from the heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One such example is Dominican University in Marin County. They've offered free schooling to Iraqi refugees. As part of the Iraqi Student Project, they will receive tuition and fee waivers. It may not seem like much to some, but I can tell you, this generous gift will change lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our communities can make these small but priceless gestures. But the real work lies here under the Dome. We have the support of the American people, the Iraqis, and the world community. We can't wait until next year. We can't wait until the next decade or the next century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as this spending bill comes together, Americans want to know that their voices are being heard and, most importantly, heeded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must stand strong. We must steel our spines. In November, the House of Representatives said that the primary purpose of all of those Federal dollars was a safe and orderly redeployment. The administration disagreed saying it won't back down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will consider spending over $1 billion on the Iraq occupation in the coming weeks, Madam Speaker. I, for one, welcome the debate.</paragraph>
