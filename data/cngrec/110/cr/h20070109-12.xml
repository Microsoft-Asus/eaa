  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mexican illegals looking to breach entry into the United States are receiving encouraging help from their own government. In the past, the Mexican government has provided pamphlets to illegals on how to sneak into the United States. Now the Mexican government has announced it is going high tech. The government will provide illegals with GPS tracking devices, allowing them to call on the U.S. Cavalry, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, if they get lost among the treacherous  rivers and deserts lining the U.S.-Mexico border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing out GPS devices free of charge, Mexico wants the U.S. to rescue illegals that are in trouble on American soil and provide them free medical attention but supposedly let them still stay in the United States. Instead of discouraging Mexican citizens from illegally entering America,  Mexico is asking the U.S. to cooperate, ignore the invasion and then provide aid to stranded illegals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. Our Federal Government's loyalties lie with the American people, not with illegals that are colonizing America. The U.S. must stand firm against the Mexican government's unlawful, illegal invasion into our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
