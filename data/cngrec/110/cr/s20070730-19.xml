  <narrative>RETIREMENT OF PAUL CULLINAN -- (Senate - July 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10310">S10310</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, as chairman of the Budget Committee, and along with my colleague, Senator Gregg, the ranking member, I would like to gratefully acknowledge the expert assistance that the Congress has received from Paul Cullinan during his time at the Congressional Budget Office. Paul is retiring from congressional service in August, and this institution will sorely miss him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Cullinan arrived at CBO in 1981, and has contributed to a vast range of policy analyses, budget projections, and legislative cost estimates over the past 26 years. But more important than the amount and variety of such work is the consistently high quality of that work and Paul's continual dedication to providing the Congress with thorough and timely analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 13 years, Paul Cullinan has served as the unit chief of CBO's Human Resources Cost Estimates Unit. He excelled in that role, and his service there allowed CBO to provide critical support to consideration of many varied pieces of legislation, including: efforts to reauthorize and extend higher education programs and the food stamps program, potential changes to Social Security, proposals to reform U.S. immigration policies, and changes to a host of income security programs. Moreover,  Paul has been a key contributor to and coordinator of CBO's work on long-term budget projections, which we have come to consider more as we move toward the pending retirement of the baby-boom generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his superb analysis of legislative proposals, Paul has provided constant and wise support to the Budget Committees in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. In short, there are only a handful of true first-tier budget experts here on Capitol Hill, and Paul Cullinan is clearly in the top ranks of that small group--we will miss his input, careful judgment, and dedication to providing the best budgetary information possible for congressional consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I join with Senator Conrad in recognizing Paul Cullinan of the Congressional Budget Office. Paul's leadership, extremely dedicated work, and the products of his unit have been essential to understanding entitlement programs and the long-term fiscal condition of the United States. Paul has served CBO Directors and Budget Committee Members of the House and Senate with distinction. He represents the type of dedicated public servants whom we are fortunate to have  at the CBO.</paragraph>
