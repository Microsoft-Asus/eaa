    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today, calling for expanded domestic energy exploration and for a truly comprehensive energy policy, including renewables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Access to oil and natural gas resources from Federal lands and waters is critical to the energy supply of West Virginia consumers, businesses, and homeowners. Specifically, the Outer Continental Shelf will be increasingly important to our Nation's energy future. Approximately 25 percent of U.S. oil and natural gas production comes from offshore areas. Technology has allowed the industry to explore deeper in the Gulf of Mexico and to make many new discoveries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, current policy unnecessarily keeps many promising prospects off limits, restraining additional growth and supplies. Congress and past Presidents have put a stop to offshore drilling and development. This must end. With gas prices at more than $4 a gallon and filling up the minivan at $70, we simply cannot afford to deliberately ignore our abundant resources. It is time to use our resources and to use our common sense.</paragraph>
