  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. The Senator from Oklahoma wishes to speak, but before that, I would like to make a unanimous consent request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader said we could offer amendments on energy that dealt with gas prices. We said we hadn't heard that to be the case for the last 8 days, but we are eager to do that. So I would like to renew, once again, the unanimous consent request that would establish a way in which this Senate on Monday could take up $4-a-gallon gasoline, with amendments on each side of the aisle and debate them with a limited time agreement and try to come to a result on both the issues of more supply and  less demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the pending energy speculation measure in the following manner: that the bill be subject to energy-related amendments only; provided further that the amendments be considered in an alternating manner between the two sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I further ask consent that the bill remain the pending business to the exclusion of all other business other than privileged matters or items that are agreed to jointly by the two leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I further ask consent that the first seven amendments to be offered on this side of the aisle by the Republican leader or his designee be the following: Outer Continental Shelf exploration plus plug-in hybrid cars; No. 2, oil shale plus conservation; No. 3, Alaska energy production plus conservation; No. 4, the Gas Price Reduction Act; No. 5, the clean nuclear energy amendment; No. 6, the coal-to-liquid energy amendment for military aviation fuel, plus the conservation provisions in that amendment;  and No. 7, LIHEAP.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> In my capacity as a Senator from Pennsylvania, I object.</chair>
