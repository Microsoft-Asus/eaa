    <paragraph>Madam President, this morning there will be 2 hours of debate on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the Lobbying and Ethics Reform Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time is to be equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their designees. Following the 2 hours, the leaders will, if they wish, use leader time to conclude the debate. Therefore, the vote on the motion to invoke cloture is expected to occur at around 11:45, or shortly thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After that cloture vote, we will remain on the lobbying measure until we complete action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken to the participants. It appears they are not going to require a lot of time. That should not take much time, so we can get back to work on the matter relating to children's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager on our side this morning is going to be the distinguished chair of the Rules Committee, Senator Feinstein. She will be first recognized because she is the manager of the bill.</paragraph>
