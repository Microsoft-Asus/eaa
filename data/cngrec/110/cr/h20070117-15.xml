    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the media just loves to give names to the different Congresses. I think that they should call this one the Hold-Onto-Your-Wallet Congress, because they are definitely coming to a wallet near you and it is going to be yours. During their first 100 hours, which is seeming to never end, they are spending billions of dollars of the American taxpayers' money on, guess what, bigger government, right here in Washington. They are not sending that money back to the local communities.  And today they are going to have their student loan bill up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are some facts. They would have you believe that we have slashed student loans and it is just not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is a fact. In a shocking display of hypocrisy, Democrat leaders are paying for their $6 billion plus plan with some of the same lender subsidy cuts crafted by congressional Republicans in the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another fact. House Republicans have committed a record $13 billion for Pell Grants, a two-thirds increase over the past decade. Go look it up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another fact. To the tune of more than $4 billion over 5 years, congressional Republicans established the first-ever grant program for high-achieving Pell students in their first and second years of college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fact. Republicans have a solid record of helping students get and stay in school.</paragraph>
