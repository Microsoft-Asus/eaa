  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people cherish freedom. That's why President Reagan repealed the so-called Fairness Doctrine back in 1987 that actually regulated the content of radio airwaves for more than four decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, while some of the most powerful Democrats in Congress make plans to restore this Depression-era regulation, Republicans have taken action. We introduced the Broadcaster Freedom Act that would take the power to restore the Fairness Doctrine away from this or any future President, and we filed a discharge petition to force an up or down vote. But in 245 days, not one single House Democrat has signed the discharge petition for broadcast freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my Democrat colleagues this respectful challenge. If you cherish freedom, you cherish the freedom of the press. If you cherish the airwaves of America, left, right and center, let's make this Fourth of July Radio Independence Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sign the discharge petition for broadcast freedom by Independence Day.</paragraph>
