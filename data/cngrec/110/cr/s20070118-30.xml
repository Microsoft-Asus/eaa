    <paragraph>Madam President, today I honor Richard H. Shapiro, who retired as executive director of the Congressional Management Foundation, CMF, in December after 18 years of service with the foundation and 17 years as its executive director. During those 18 years, Mr. Shapiro has worked tirelessly to help all member and committee offices operate more productively and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Shapiro is a talented business consultant who has adapted many of the best practice methods of the business world to the unique institution that is the congressional office, and taken the time to train thousands of congressional staffers in these methods. In addition, Mr. Shapiro and his staff at CMF have conducted organizational assessments for member, committee and leadership offices. Some years ago, he was kind enough to conduct a structure evaluation for my Senate office, and he made  several useful suggestions regarding my office's mail operation, web site and internal communications. My office implemented them all, and both my office and constituents are all better off for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has also helped many new Members of Congress set up both their Washington and district offices, a task that can be very daunting for anyone new to Congress. He has also conducted individual assessments and coaching for senior managers and Members. Under his leadership, the CMF began offering management guidance to congressional officers responsible for managing the House or Senate as a whole. Furthermore, Mr. Shapiro has helped to coordinate bipartisan events for all the Chiefs of Staff, which  helps them get to know each other and work together better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Shapiro was also a leader in promoting the use of the World Wide Web and other digital forms of communications in Congress. Under his leadership, the CMF pushed for Members of Congress to establish Web sites that constituents could use to e-mail their representatives and get information on Congress. The CMF continues to encourage congressional offices to improve their Web sites by giving out the annual Golden Mouse award to the office with the best and most innovative Web site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Considering all that CMF has done under Mr. Shapiro's leadership, one is very surprised to find out that CMF has a very small staff and budget. But those who know Mr. Shapiro would tell you that, given his talent and dedication, it is no big surprise that CMF was able to provide so many quality services under his helm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, it my sincerest pleasure to thank Richard Shapiro for sharing his talent and dedication with us for so many years. Congress is a better place for it.</paragraph>
