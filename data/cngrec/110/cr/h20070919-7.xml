  <narrative>PRIVATIZATION OF IRAQI OIL--SPOILS OF WAR TO BUSH ALLY? -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10514]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>The recent oil deal between the U.S.-based Hunt Oil Company and the Kurdistan Regional Government raises questions since Hunt Oil, a privately held oil company based in Texas and its founder, Ray Hunt, have close ties to Vice-President CHENEY and are large donors to President Bush. The deal also appears to undercut the goal of oil revenue sharing but is predictably consistent with the administration's attempt to privatize Iraqi oil assets. Both Hunt Oil Company and Kurdistan  are strong allies with the Bush administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said for 5 years, this war is about oil. The Bush administration desires private control of Iraqi oil, but we have no right to force Iraq to give up control of their oil. We have no right to set preconditions for Iraq which lead Iraq to giving up control of their oil. The Constitution of Iraq designates that the oil of Iraq is the property of all Iraqi people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am calling for a congressional investigation to determine the role the administration may have played in the Hunt-Kurdistan deal, the effect the deal could have on the oil revenue sharing plan and the attempt by the administration to privatize Iraqi oil.</paragraph>
