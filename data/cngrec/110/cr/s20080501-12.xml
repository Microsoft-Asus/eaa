  <narrative>SMALL BUSINESS EMPOWERMENT ACT -- (Senate - May 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3653">S3653</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, earlier this week, I spoke on the Senate floor about Cover the Uninsured Week and a bill I was introducing that would increase access to health coverage for small businesses and self-employed individuals--a group we all too often forget about around here. Today I am formally introducing the Small Business Empowerment Act. I wish to discuss this bill in a bit more depth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, why is it necessary?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is necessary because 82 percent--82 percent--of the uninsured work for a living. They have jobs. The overwhelming majority work in small companies--companies with 2 people, 5 people, 20 people--or they are self-employed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Ohio, my State--whether you are in Steubenville or Lima, whether you are in Kent or Chillicothe--99 percent of firms with more than 50 workers sponsor health insurance. So if you are at a relatively midsized or larger company, you have 50 or more workers, 99 percent of those firms offer some kind of fairly decent insurance for their employees. That is for companies above 50 employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For companies under 50 employees, only 44 percent of those firms do. Many of them are self-employed. Many of them only have 5 or 10 or 15 employees. Small employers who do offer coverage--and most of them absolutely try to--I have talked to small businesspeople from Springfield to Zanesville, from Bellaire to Delphos, and I hear repeatedly from small businesses they want to insure their employees, but it is getting harder and harder and harder. According to the well-respected RAND Corporation--a  nonpartisan group that dispassionately analyzes these kinds of things--small businesses saw the economic burden of health insurance rise by 30 percent between 2000 and 2005. And it is getting worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The situation is even worse for the self-employed, who must contend with staggeringly high premiums for individual coverage--they don't get any group-rate break--if they can find an insurer even willing to cover them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these small pools, if you have 3 employees or 8 employees or you are self-employed, and there is anybody in this small pool of 1 or 20 who has some major preexisting condition, you probably cannot get insurance at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the meantime, health insurers have been living large, their profits increasing by more than a third over the last 5 years--not much different from the oil industry, where the public recoils from staggeringly high gas prices, and the oil industry is making record high profits. The public--particularly small business--is recoiling from higher health insurance premiums and higher copays and deductibles. Yet health insurance companies are doing better and better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Middle-class families are shouldering the burden of skyrocketing gas prices and ballooning food prices, even as the equity in their homes erodes and the cost of putting their children through college explodes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be ideal if they could afford to pay a king's ransom for health insurance. They cannot. And they should not have to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With those realities staring us in the face, inaction from this body is the same as indifference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation attacks the issue of health coverage access from several different directions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure widespread access, the bill would establish a national insurance pool modeled after the successful Federal Employees Health Benefits program. The FEHB, Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which enables enrollees to choose from a variety of health plans, with rates and benefits negotiated by the Federal Office of Personnel Management, has served Members of Congress and hundreds of thousands of Federal employees well for many years now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So understand, there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Federal employees--whether they work in the Celebrezze Building in Cleveland, whether they work in the Office of Management and Budget in Washington, whether they work in Bethesda for the National Institutes of Health, whether they work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; any of these Federal jobs--Federal employees are in a huge pool that negotiates price. So it obviously works in a way that keeps rates in check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under my bill, an independent contractor would manage a program that looks like FEHB, with a few modifications to accommodate the market segment it would serve. A few of those modifications are designed to hold down costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would establish a reinsurance program to pay claims that fall between $5,000 and $75,000. That is where small business gets hit the hardest. When 1 or 2 or 3 employees, in a company of 50 or 40 or 30 or 100, get hit with a huge bill of hundreds of thousands of dollars, it affects the entire pool, and it affects everyone's premium and, in many cases, it makes insurance for the small business employer simply out of reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill establishes a reinsurance program to pay  claims that fall between $5,000 and $75,000. This approach minimizes premium spikes and it makes coverage affordable for companies regardless of the age and the health of their employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill establishes what is called a loss-ratio standard for insurers. This means that insurers would be required to spend most of their premium income on claims, and hold down their administrative costs. We know what happens with small employers: the administrative costs the insurance companies take are typically huge and have a major impact on the per-employee cost of health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would identify and apply strategies to ensure that providers employ "best practices" in health care, which means they are providing the right care at the right time in the right amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill would target price gouging by drug manufacturers and manufacturers of other medical products, including medical devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Price gouging occurs in U.S. health care when a company exploits American consumers by charging them dramatically higher prices than consumers in other wealthy nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we paying so much more for prescription drugs in this country than the Canadians pay, when the Canadians often are buying drugs manufactured in the United States? It is the same drug, same brand name, same packaging, same dosage. Yet they are paying in Canada sometimes half as much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, for years, I used to take--when I was in the House of Representatives--busloads of constituents to Canada, about 2, 2 1/2  hours away from Lorain, OH, where I lived, to buy prescription drugs at a pharmacy in Ontario. The same drug, same dosage--everything was the same, except for the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other modifications in the bill are designed to ensure that health coverage is nondiscriminatory. Think about it this way: If your next-door neighbor develops a mental illness such as clinical depression, and you develop a medical illness such as heart disease, why should your next-door neighbor be denied health benefits that you get because that is a mental illness versus a physical illness? We both have paid premiums. Your next-door neighbor and you have both paid premiums to cover your health  care costs. You both need health care. Why is one condition--the condition of heart disease--more worthy of coverage than the condition of clinical depression?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill charges a group representing providers, businesses, consumers, economists, and health policy experts with rethinking health care coverage to eliminate arbitrary differences in the coverage of equally disruptive, disabling, or dangerous health conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is this: We have an opportunity to expand access to health coverage in a way that achieves fundamental goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One, we reach populations who cannot find a home in the current insurance system because they are small businesses, typically, or self employed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We stand up for American consumers who are paying absolutely ridiculous prices in many cases for essential health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We demand spending discipline on the part of insurers. They have chosen to play a pivotal role in the health of our Nation. They can live with reasonable limits on their administrative costs, as their profits go up and their executive salaries are in the stratosphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can clean up duplication and random variation in the delivery of health care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can end arbitrary coverage rules that turn health protection into a health care crapshoot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the sake of small employers, for the sake of their employees, for the sake of self-employed entrepreneurs--whom we need so desperately in this country to compete globally--and for the sake of every American who did not request, did not sign up for a particular health problem, and should not be penalized for having it, I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will support my legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
