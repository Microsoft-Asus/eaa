  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, economists say the most important thing Congress can do to stimulate our struggling economy is to act quickly, and that is exactly what this House is going to do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House leaders from both parties worked with the President to craft the bipartisan agreement that is before us. We came together, and by acting quickly, we are hoping that our actions spark our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package is going to provide some relief to middle-income families who have been left behind in many ways over the last 7 years. This bill gives 117 million Americans a tax rebate so they can begin to breathe a little easier when paying their bills in the coming months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally important, this economic package also gives tax breaks to small businesses to help spur investment and job creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, economists said we need to act fast, and that is what we did. Let's get to work and pass this economic stimulus package today.</paragraph>
