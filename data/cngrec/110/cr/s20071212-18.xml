  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 3596">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will try to be succinct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crop insurance is a critical part of farm policy in America. It is not working perfectly. A number of farmers do not like it and do not take it out. Many do take it out and are not happy with the way it works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We spend a lot of money on it. The Federal Government contributes 58 percent of the premiums for crop insurance, totaling $3.2 billion a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the goals of crop insurance was to eliminate ad hoc individual disaster relief bills when farm disasters occur. Yet, since 2002, we have averaged $1.3 billion in additional disaster relief to agriculture. So it has not met that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, the Alabama Farmers Federation, now affiliated with the National Farm Bureau, had a study of crop insurance. Farmers recommended--these were farmers--they recommended we adopt a system in which farmers, if they chose, could take the subsidy from the Federal Government, plus their own premium, and pay that into a farm disaster savings account and draw on that account if a disaster occurred--but only if they voluntarily chose to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have studied that. I believe it is a good policy. I talked to Secretary Johanns when he was Secretary of Agriculture a few months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He tells me he thought it would be particularly good if we moved forward in this way as a pilot program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have offered this amendment which would call on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to create farm savings accounts for insurance purposes, which would allow the Federal contribution to Federal crop insurance to go into that account, along with the farmer's contribution, but only for 1 percent of the farmers in America. That would limit it to a number of 20,000. Then we would try it out and see how it works. I think it could work very well for quite a number of farmers; I don't know how many.  It certainly will not eliminate the need for crop insurance. Most farmers, I am sure, would want to have crop insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under my amendment, farmers would have to have catastrophic insurance. Their crop insurance numbers would be a smaller amount to take care of the more routine financial losses that farmers incur. I think it is a good program. It has been thought out pretty carefully. We have worked with the Department of Agriculture, the Alabama Farm Bureau, the Farmers Federation. They support it strongly. The National Farm Bureau has not taken a position. So I think it is the kind of legislation we ought to  consider, and I urge my colleagues to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a few years, we will see how it is working. If it is not working, so be it. If it is working, we might want to make it permanent. So I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, reserving the remainder of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 3596">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are constantly coming to the floor or going into committees and talking about the fact that when it comes to the complicated programs we deal with, it is critically important that Members, as well as our staffs, think outside the box and come up with new ideas, new concepts that make sense, where we can take bureaucratic programs and streamline them, make them better, make them easier, make them more, in this case, farmer friendly. For that reason I compliment  the Senator from Alabama. I think he has come up with an excellent idea. It has the potential for providing something similar to an idea that was prevalent in the House several years ago that was proposed by a Congressman from Kansas, KENNY HULSHOF, and that was to create farm savings accounts that the farmer could use to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem I have with the amendment right now is that we have had no hearings on it in the committee, and we are not sure of whether it can even be implemented as a part of this particular farm bill in conjunction with the crop insurance provisions that are in our bill. I have talked to my dear friend Senator Sessions. I have told him I regret I will have to vote against it, but a vote against it is not a vote against the concept or against the fact that he has now come in and has  thought outside the box, and I think he has a very good concept that I would encourage the chairman to look at as we move in the next year into the implementation of this farm bill. Let's have some hearings. Let's get some economists, some crop insurance folks to think about it and see if we can't maybe even think about a stand-alone bill for it and not wait for the next farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it has merit. I just think trying to incorporate it into this bill presents complexities that I don't think we can accommodate.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 3596">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join my colleague and concur in his remarks on the Sessions amendment. For a lot of subjects before us we get good ideas, interesting ideas that come up via amendments on bills. This isn't the first time it has happened. As Senator Chambliss said, this idea has been talked about, floated around for a while. Senator Sessions has perhaps focused it more than I have seen in the past on the savings account idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think Senator Chambliss is right. This is a very complicated subject. It involves a lot of different considerations and as well as interactions with other programs in agriculture. I would just say to my friend from Alabama that I would, with Senator Chambliss, be willing to have some hearings on this next year, and I invite the Senator to testify and bring some witnesses in, as Senator Chambliss says, some agricultural economists, some agricultural producers,  and see what this proposal would do. If it has legs, if it has some merit, we could move it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just because we pass a farm bill doesn't mean that our committee is dormant for 5 years. We will be holding hearings and working on legislation. The occupant of the chair, too, will be actively involved in a lot of those discussions next year as a valuable member of our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would just say to the Senator from Alabama, I am going to join Senator Chambliss in opposing the amendment. Not that I am absolutely, irrevocably opposed to it, but it is a little bit too much of a change on a bill now, without the kind of hearings and due diligence that we should apply to it. So I will oppose it. But I will say this to Senator Sessions: I look forward to having some hearings on it next year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his willingness to consider this. I do believe I have given a good bit of thought to it, and I have shared it with the committee for the last several or couple weeks. But at any rate, I urge my colleagues to support it, recognizing that it is a pilot program involving only 1 percent of the farmers in America, and from that pilot program, we may learn that we have a good program indeed. So I urge support for it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 3596">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am here to speak briefly on my amendment, which is amendment No. 3810. I am going to reserve most of my time for tomorrow because some of my colleagues want to address this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, America's farm safety net was created during the Great Depression. It was created to protect struggling family farmers from volatile prices and from volatile weather. I think the reasons for that safety net still remain today. That is why I am a strong supporter of this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there are some forward thinking provisions in this farm bill, including with regard to energy, cellulosic energy--something near and  dear to my heart. We have worked hard on those provisions. The permanent disaster relief is so important for the farmers in my State. I think the safety net that helped our farmers in the 2002 farm bill and allowed them to take risks and revitalize a lot of the areas in this country are good. That is why I support  this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also believe there is a need for reform in this farm bill. I believe the money that is set aside for a safety net for our farmers should be going to the hard-working farmers in this country and not to urban millionaires. When you look at what happened over the last few years, there are scandals. There are people who should not have gotten this money. There are art collectors in San Francisco and real estate developers in Florida. When we look at where the money went, I think we can conclude  there are not a lot of farms in, say, the District of Columbia, where we stand today. Mr. President, $3.1 million in farm payments went to the District of Columbia, $4.2 million has gone to people living in Manhattan, and $1 billion of taxpayer money for farm payments has gone to Beverly Hills 90210. The last time I checked, there is not a lot of farmland in those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we can fix this problem. As Senator Dorgan said today, if we don't fix it ourselves, someone is going to fix it for us. I believe the people who live in farm States have an obligation to make sure these programs are appropriate and that they are going to the right people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am proud that in this last farm bill, as a member of the Agriculture Committee, we have included in this farm bill an end to the three-entity rule. We have eliminated it. It will cut down the abuse by applying payment limits strictly to individuals and married couples and to ending the practice of dividing farms into multiple corporations so they get multiple payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also support the Dorgan-Grassley amendment that puts some sensible limits on the total number of subsidies. But also I believe it is very important that we put some reasonable limits on income eligibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what we have here with our amendment is reasonable. Let me go through what the law is right now. Right now, the law, for full-time farmers, says if you get at least 75 percent of your income from farming, you have an unlimited amount of income and profit you can make, and you can still get Government subsidies. That is how it works. It says for part-time farmers, if you get $2.45 million--you may just be an investor in Beverly Hills--you can still make up to $2.5 million, and you get the  subsidies. We know that with the budget problems this country is facing, we need to make some sensible reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has proposed a $200,000 limit on income for both part-time and full-time farmers. The House-passed version has suggested a $1 million limit on income for full-time farmers and a $500,000 limit for part-time farmers. So it is more generous than the administration, but it is still a big change from what the current law is. Our Senate bill that came out of committee, unfortunately, still allows for unlimited income for full-time farmers, and then basically for part-time farmers ends  up after a number of years at $750,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What our amendment does, the Klobuchar-Durbin-Brown amendment--and we have a number of people on the other side of the aisle who are going to be supporting this as well, as well as the Department of Agriculture. It simply says for full-time farmers, if you make in profit $750,000, at that point you are not going to get any more Government farm payments. Now, if you have a bad year, and disaster strikes and you go below that amount, you will be eligible for those payments. For part-time farmers,  some of the investors, the people who are making less than 66 percent of their income from farming, if you make $250,000, then, at that point, you are no longer eligible for these payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I don't think this is something outrageous. I think this is good policy. When I think about the farmers in my State, the average income of a farmer is $54,000. That is why as we look at this farm bill and what we want to do for the new and beginning farmers, we want to get more farmers involved in agriculture. We want to do more for nutrition, conservation, and most important to me, moving to this next generation of cellulosic ethanol, we have to acknowledge that at some point, multimillionaires  who live in urban areas should not be getting these farm payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am going to reserve the remainder of my time for tomorrow because my colleagues want to address this issue. I think we will have a good debate. But I wanted to put it in people's minds tonight so they can go back and talk to their staffs about how important it is and how sensible it is to put some reasonable income limits on this farm bill. Right now, our Senate bill has no income limits for full-time farmers and goes all the way up to $750,000 for part-time farmers. I believe we can do  better and still strongly support the family farmers in this country. I support them. My State is sixth in the country for agriculture; No. 1 turkey producer in the country. We have a lot of corn. We have some great people who are revitalizing our State because of the hard work they did, and</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 3596">
    <paragraph>First of all, I would like to take just a moment--we had an amendment No. 3530 which I think the committee has agreed to accept and will come to later, but I wanted to spend a moment talking about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 20 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has paid out $1.1 billion to dead farmers. Forty percent of them have been dead over 7 years; 19 percent of them have been dead over 11 years. Yet they continued to pay them. I very much appreciate the chairman and ranking member for their consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this will do is to make USDA go back and say: If you haven't gotten your estate settled in 2 years, you have to be talking to us rather than us continuing to make farm payments to people who are no longer alive. I appreciate their acceptance of that amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to set aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 3632.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The amendment is pending.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President. This is a fairly straightforward amendment. It fits with a lot of things they have done in this bill. This is about the EQIP program. This is about environmental capacity to save in terms of runoff, decrease load streams, and do a lot of things in terms of the environment, and the basic goals behind it are good. This amendment is very simple. All it says is that you ought to be a real farmer to get EQIP money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You ought to get two-thirds of your money from agriculture before you are eligible for getting this money. Why is that a problem? The problem is that our real farmers are not getting the vast majority of the money; it is our nonfarmers. If you buy 160 acres, what the marketing guy says is: I have a way for you to refence this land and build a new pond, and it will increase the value and you can turn around and sell it, except the American taxpayers pay for 40 percent of the improvements on it.  You never have to run a head of cattle on it; you never have to raise a crop on it. You can just invest in the land and qualify. That is not the intended purpose for EQIP or why we created it. I believe EQIP funds ought to go for what they are intended. What this does</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this says is that if you are a real farmer and you get two-thirds of your income from farming, agriculture, this would not apply to you. But if you are gaming the system, gaming EQIP to advantage yourself, and not as a person in production agriculture but as an investor in land or as a speculator in  land, you ought not to be able to use these moneys to increase the value. Fencing hardly improves the environment. Yet we spend money out of EQIP for  farms and ranches that are small and are not owned by real farmers but gentlemen farmers who don't produce anything. Yet they go out and have fun on some land they own and they qualify. We ought not to be paying for that with American taxpayer money. It is straightforward. It says you ought to be a real farmer before we allow EQIP money to be used to improve the environmental conditions on your farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a marked increase in the demand for these EQIP dollars. We see pivots. We can markedly decrease water consumption if we have modern pivots. We help farmers to put them in. We use less water, get less runoff, and do more no-till farming. So the demand for the dollars associated with EQIP, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, was designed for working farms and working ranches, not for the weekend farmer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Environmental Quality Incentive Program emerged as the most important USDA program providing financial assistance for conservation on working farms and ranches and is measured by the number of participants and acres under contract--the largest financial assistance conservation program in all of USDA. Yet we have real farmers and ranchers who cannot get enough help to make a difference when it comes to the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want real farmers who are really in it to produce agriculture to have this money available, and I don't want the American taxpayers paying for somebody else who has the money to do it already but is using their money to enhance the value of their property, and they are not real farmers, not real ranchers, they are not a vegetable farmer, they are not in production agriculture, they are not an orchard farmer, they are not in timber, but, in fact, they own 40 acres of timber, and therefore they  qualify even though it is purely an investment and they have no intent to harvest a crop, but they are utilizing taxpayer money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Iowa has 10 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when I hear the Senator describe how the money is going out, of course it sounds bad. No one wants EQIP money going for doctors who buy a little bit of acreage and want to put in a pond and have a fishing hole. We don't want EQIP money going for that, and it should not go for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the way the amendment is drafted, it just says two-thirds of your income has to be from farming before you can qualify for EQIP. The problem with that is there are a lot of young, beginning farmers who are farming, but they are not making enough money from the farm to sustain themselves, and they and their spouse need to work at other jobs. They may have a night job and the spouse may have a job. Most of their income may not be from that farming venture, but the money they are earning is  going into the farm and they are building up their farm asset base. I see this happening, and we don't want to discourage that. Those are the people who may need some EQIP money. They may need to build a fence for livestock production. That EQIP money ought to be there for them to do that. Maybe they are improving their land and they need</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So according to the Economic Research Service data, this amendment would bar EQIP contracts for 71.2 percent of all producers who receive them in 2006. You cannot say that 71 percent of all those people are these rich doctors putting in a fence and putting their horses out there. That may be a small part of these contracts, but it seems to me you are going after a lot of people who deserve EQIP contracts to go after some who don't deserve them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The farms that would still qualify under the Senator's amendment would tend to be relatively large farms--that is, with gross income on average over $654,000. Again, these are the producers that have a greater ability to pay for conservation. I repeat: the larger farms, where the producers get more than two-thirds of their income from farming, average over $654,000 in gross income. If you compare that to a beginning farmer, they would actually have more ability to pay for conservation on their  own, but this amendment would hurt the younger farmers with lower incomes and second jobs to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, I just think this kind of a shotgun approach isn't the way to go. I wish there were some way to refine it to get at the very problem the Senator spoke about.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>If 72 percent of the people getting EQIP money today would not get the money, that means 72 percent of the people who are getting EQIP today get less than 66 percent of the money from agriculture. That is an even bigger problem. In fact, three quarters of the people who are eligible aren't primarily getting the vast majority of their income from agriculture. Yet we are sending three quarters of the money to those people. I see that as an even bigger problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the chairman work with me to try to figure out a way to exclude those who are advantaging themselves and have no intention of working into an agriculture position as a lifestyle or as a primary vocation? Would he agree to work with me so we might come to a point where we can define the difference between those who are primarily interested in agriculture and building a young farm and excluding those who are using the American taxpayer money to improve the quality of their land so they can  turn around and sell it?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I could not agree with the Senator more. When I hear what he says, the answer is, yes, I wish we could figure out how we do that. We have not done that, and we should do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the 71 percent, that might sound alarming, but that says to me there are a lot of people out there farming who aren't making a lot of money on the farm. They do have some farm income, but think about it this way: people who may be bona fide farmers or ranchers, but they may have another business in town--maybe they are an elevator operator or something, but they are farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have to be very careful about this. I think there are a lot of these people in that 71 percent--I haven't looked at the breakdown--who are these younger farmers and have to have some off-farm income to help make ends meet or maybe they need farm income to put away for college savings or something.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Will the chairman yield for another question?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Sure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the Senator think a certification as to intent by people who apply for EQIP that their primary vocation is either now or is intended to be agriculture would be a way in which we might accomplish the goal? I am willing to withdraw this amendment if we can work on that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>That sounds interesting.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't want the small farmer to be excluded, but I think the amount of money going to nonfarmers is a lot greater than you think it is. It is not going to real farmers who have real needs and the vast majority of the acres where we are going to make the biggest difference on the environment. I ask if he would work with me between now and the time the bill comes out of conference to see if we cannot address that, and if he would do so, as well as the ranking member, I will ask unanimous  consent to withdraw this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I give the Senator my word. I want the same thing he wants. It burns me up, too, to see some of these people who buy acres and they get EQIP money to put up a nice pond or a horse shed. I agree with him. Maybe we can get our staffs and get people to think about how we might fashion this to exclude those people from the EQIP program. I would love to see that happen.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, also, he knows I sympathize with him on this issue. We talked about it. He talked to me about a couple of specific instances that are just wrong. I talked earlier today about as hard as we try to prohibit abuses that crop up in farm programs, we know they are there. Whatever we can do to close the loopholes, I would like to do it here. Obviously, I am happy to continue to work with the Senator from Oklahoma.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield further, maybe the Senator is onto something in terms of intent or what they are doing, coupled with, perhaps, the productive capacity and what that land is actually producing on an annualized basis.</paragraph>

  <chair> (4) based on the report of the Commission referred to in subsection (a) and the proposed legislation referred to in subsection (b), Congress should work toward a comprehensive legislative response to the issue of food safety.&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the pending amendment offered by friend and colleague Senator Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an amendment that would make important changes to America's food safety policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We clearly need to make a change. For far too long, we have gone without a comprehensive review of our food safety laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ancient statutes remain on the books, standards have not been updated, budgets have atrophied, and consumers have suffered from food borne illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, added the food safety system to its "High Risk List" of government functions that pose a risk to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The designation follows an extensive series of GAO, National Academies of Science, and inspector general reports calling for major improvements in our food safety system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year alone, we have witnessed 48 recalls of contaminated products regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, Food Safety Inspection Service, FSIS, and more than 150 recalls of contaminated products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Included in these statistics are recalls of more than 3 years of production of certain brands of peanut butter tainted with salmonella, a full year of production of ground beef tainted with E. coli, and more than 100 brands of popular cat and dog food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 2 months alone, there have been recalls of 5 million units of frozen pizza and 1 million more pounds of beef tainted with E. coli.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, there are approximately 76 million cases of food borne disease each year in the United States. While many of these cases are mild, CDC estimates that food borne illness causes 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The food industry is one of the most important sectors of the national economy, generating more than $1 trillion in economic activity annually and employing millions of American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, over the past several months, consumer confidence in the safety of our food supply has dropped precipitously, posing a risk to this sector of the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Food Marketing Institute's 2007 survey of consumer confidence, the number of consumers confident in the safety of supermarket food declined from 82 percent in 2006 to 66 percent today--the lowest point since 1989. The same survey shows that consumer confidence in restaurant food is even lower, at 43 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the United States continues to have one of the safest food supplies in the world, the authorities and standards we set and the investments in food safety we make are being surpassed by other major industrialized nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A significant portion of the responsibility for this trend rests with Congress. While other countries have updated their food safety laws to reflect best available science, technology, and practices, we have allowed our statutes to become dated and obsolete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have underfunded this critical government function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is alarming that the safety of our food supply depends on ancient statutes that were written to address vastly different food safety challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Meat Inspection Act was passed in 1906 partly in response to Upton Sinclair's accounts of Chicago's meat packing plants in his novel "The Jungle."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been only one major review of our meat laws and that occurred 40 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Poultry Products Inspection Act celebrates its 50th anniversary this year and the Egg Products Inspection Act is more than 35 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1938 and has never been comprehensively reauthorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the key statute used by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate about 80 percent of our food supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, although our understanding of food borne illness, preventative measures, microbiology, sanitation practices, and industry best practices has been transformed by developments in science and technology, the core principles of these statutes remain in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Into this void has stepped an uncoordinated, irregular sweep of crises-specific legislation, such as the Infant Formula Act of 1980 and Import Milk Act, as well as dozens of regulatory efforts to improve the safety of specific products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agencies have faced legal challenges as to whether they have the authority to implement some of these regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time that Congress stepped forward to exercise oversight and ensure that we comprehensively improve our food safety system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why my colleague Senator Kennedy and I are offering an amendment to the farm bill that would set a trajectory toward a comprehensive review of the laws that underpin our food safety system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although food safety is one of the most dynamic functions of the federal government and relies heavily on developments in science, technology, and best practices, there is no mechanism for Congress to regularly review developments and reauthorize the agencies that perform these tasks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already included in the bill we're considering is language that would create a Food Safety Commission, a mechanism for Congress, the administration, academia, industry, consumer groups, and others to work together on comprehensive food safety reform and recommend specific statutory language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commission is tasked with studying the in our current system and making specific legislative recommendations to the President and Congress on how to improve our laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have directed the Commission to do its work based on universally agreed upon principles--allocate resources according to risk, base policies on best available science, improve coordination of budgets and personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment goes further than that language. It directs the President to review these recommendations and findings and report his or her recommendations back to Congress in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language puts Congress on a track of holding hearings and moving such comprehensive food safety reform through the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the language contains sense-of-the-Senate language that it is the policy of the U.S. Senate to provide our food safety functions with adequate resources, that we increase the number of inspectors looking at food shipments, and that it is vital for Congress to move forward with comprehensive food safety reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will compel the participation of all stakeholders in the Commission process and will compel Congress and the Administration to act on its recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer this amendment and ask for my colleagues to support this effort to modernize our food safety system.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED CONSERVATION PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, all of us who represent Chesapeake Bay watershed States in the Senate are grateful that the bill reported out by the Agriculture Committee recognizes the very serious challenge that we have with excess nutrients and sediments in the bay. As I testified to your committee back in the spring, every year huge areas of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries become "dead zones," which occur when there isn't enough dissolved oxygen for aquatic life to thrive. Not all  the excess nutrients that create these dead zones come from agriculture, but a substantial part of them do. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Conservation Program in your bill will go a long way in assisting farmers in our States implement projects to better manage their nutrient-rich runoff. The new program represents a significant part of the $700 million annually that scientists and agricultural experts estimate is needed on the ground to bring the runoff to ecologically acceptable levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My question is just to clarify the intent of the committee regarding this new program. Am I correct in my understanding that, although the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Conservation Program uses EQIP authorities, it has its own funding stream and therefore will not reduce the normal EQIP allocations to Maryland and the other Chesapeake Bay watershed States?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED CONSERVATION PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>That is correct, Senator. Section 2361 provides an additional funding stream totaling $165 million from 2007 through 2012 to address the critical needs of the Chesapeake Bay. This funding is separate from EQIP and is not intended to offset funding allocated under that program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED CONSERVATION PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for that clarification. I would like to ask the distinguished ranking member, the same question. Is it your understanding that the legislation before us today provides a unique funding stream for the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Conservation Program without reducing the normal EQIP allocations to the Maryland and the other Chesapeake Bay watershed States?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED CONSERVATION PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>I am happy to confirm with the Senator from Maryland that he understands the provision correctly. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Conservation Program is to be implemented by the NRCS in addition to EQIP or any other existing conservation program. The Chesapeake Bay basin is the watershed for our Nation's Capital and the Bay is a national treasure. The committee is providing this extraordinary support for this extraordinary watershed and its farmers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman and distinguished ranking member for their clarifications.
