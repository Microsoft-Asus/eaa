    <paragraph>Mr. President, very quickly--I know the hour is late--I spoke to Speaker Pelosi a couple of hours ago. Next week, the House is going to take up the Iraq situation. The legislation they will deal with, I have been told by the Speaker, is whether the House of Representatives will support the surge, the escalation in Iraq. They will finish that next week, and we will get it then, and it will be very direct and to the point.</paragraph>
