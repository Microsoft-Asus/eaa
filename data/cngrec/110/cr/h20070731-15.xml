    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Reverend Richard David Turpin, who has so eloquently provided the blessing to open the House this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Turpin serves as the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in beautiful Catskill, New York, just across the Hudson River from my home in New York's 20th Congressional District. And I welcome his beautiful family, who has joined us in the gallery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Reverend is a native of New York's capital region and has been an influential force in the Catskill community since he assumed his current position in the Second Baptist Church in 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As preacher and counselor for the prison ministry at Albany Correctional Facility, chaplain for the Albany Rescue Mission, president of the Hudson River Frontier Missionary Baptist Association Laymen Ministry, and athletic coordinator for the Youth Department of the Empire Missionary Baptist Convention, Reverend Turpin has touched the lives of young and old throughout upstate New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank him for his service to our district, for his dedication to his faith, and for taking the time to travel with his family from Clifton Park to address the House of Representatives today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
