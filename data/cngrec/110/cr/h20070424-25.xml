  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week is "Cover the Uninsured Week," highlighting the fact that the health and well-being of our Nation's future is at stake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 45 million Americans will be without health insurance at some point during this year. It's past time that Washington helps find real solutions to this very real problem. With colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and in the House and Senate, we have introduced legislation that will begin to take a meaningful approach to bringing down the cost of health care and help cover all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Health Partnership through Creative Federalism Act, <bill type="h" number="506">H.R. 506</bill>, empowers individual States and regions to develop unique solutions to fit the needs of their citizens. We are fighting to put the needs of patients first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike many other proposals, our reform rejects a one-size-fits-all model. The inflexibility of such an antiquated approach has continually proven ineffective in addressing individual health care needs. Working together, we can find a way to provide health care coverage for all Americans, so that American families will have a brighter and healthier future.</paragraph>
