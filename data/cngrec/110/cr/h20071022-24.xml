  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to explain the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the Chair of the Subcommittee on Parks for coming to the Virgin Islands and having a hearing in St. John on this important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, <bill type="h" number="53">H.R. 53</bill>, was introduced by me on January 4 of this year to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to lease land on the island of St. John to the Government of the United States Virgin Islands to build a public school. The legislation is strongly supported by the people of the Virgin Islands, particularly the residents of St. John.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Virgin Islands National Park was authorized by Congress in 1956 and established largely by an initial land donation by Laurance Rockefeller through the Jackson Hole Preserve, Incorporated. In 1962 and 1978, the park was enlarged by Congress so that it now takes up almost two-thirds of St. John, which is only 22 square miles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For at least the past three decades, the Government of the Virgin Islands and the National Park Service have been discussing the question of securing suitable land on the island of St. John to construct the public school. Since the 1970s, public school enrollment on St. John has more than doubled, and the U.S. VI Government owns no land on the island to expand either of the two public schools that now exist or to build a new one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two existing public schools, Julius E. Sprauve and the Guy H. Benjamin Elementary School, only accommodate children up to the ninth grade. St. Johnian high school children have to travel to St. Thomas, 20 minutes by ferry over open ocean to complete their secondary education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Julius E. Sprauve School is in the middle of a heavily trafficked area, which really threatens and puts the lives of our children at risk as they come to and from school. About 2 years ago, a second-grade student was killed leaving a Christmas party. The schools are not in the best location; especially that school is not in the best location for our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that with limited land and the continued growth and population, this legislation is critically needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member DON YOUNG and Subcommittee Parks Chairman RA&#xDA;L GRIJALVA and Insular Affairs Subcommittee ranking member, LUIS FORTU&#xD1;O, for their support to have this legislation considered on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have to thank the One Campus Group in St. John, Kirstin Cox, Lorelei Monsanto, Alvis Christian, Ronnie Jones and all of the others for the work that they have done to get us this far and to bring the community together in support of the process that is outlined in <bill type="h" number="53">H.R. 53</bill> when all else failed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the people of St. John and to support <bill type="h" number="53">H.R. 53</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>I do thank my colleague from the Virgin Islands for outlining <bill type="h" number="53">H.R. 53</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two-thirds of the island of St. John is comprised of the Virgin Islands National Park. The park's dominant size is negatively impacting the quality of life for the growing population there at St. John. Without utilizing the park land, there is no other suitable property to build a school on St. John.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the bill. We had hoped to consider an amendment to convey the property outright for the school, as was offered, but then withdrawn by Congressman JEFF FLAKE during our committee consideration of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, Chairman Rahall has given his support for other long-term leases, and this bill does establish an important precedent for the National Park Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We support the bill. It is for a great purpose. I would urge my colleagues to support this, since we don't have an amendment to give it outright to my colleague, but, in the meantime, we support this bill and wish the project well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs. Christensen) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="53">H.R. 53</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
