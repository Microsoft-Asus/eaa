  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill>, an expansion of taxpayer funding for embryonic stem cell research. And while today's debate is sure to be full of rhetoric about the promise of future cures, let's be clear from the outset about what is working and what is not. Embryonic stem cell research, that is, research that requires the destruction of a living human embryo, is yet to produce a single cure or treatment in humans. Not one. What many say is a false hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good news is that there is an alternative that is not only successfully treating human patients but doesn't require killing little human embryos. In fact, what many consider ethical, adult stem cell research has now provided dozens of laboratory successes, successful treatments of human patients and even a handful of FDA-approved therapies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tax dollars are not unlimited. They should be directed towards methods that are proven to work and ethical research. <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill> fails to do this.</paragraph>
