  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 8 to 10, the residents of Davenport will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Davenport, a railroad town located in Cass County just 20 miles southwest of Fargo, is a community of about 261 people. The city was founded in 1882 and platted by G.F. Channing and Henry D. Cooke, Jr. The post office was established April 6, 1882, and Davenport was organized into a city in 1895. Channing named the town for Mary Buckland Davenport, a friend from Massachusetts and the second wife of William Claflin, who was the Governor of Massachusetts from 1869 to 1872.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Davenport has plenty to offer its residents and visitors. Young couples and families are drawn to Davenport as it offers an escape from the big city, more affordable housing, and an opportunity to raise children in a more rural setting. Businesses in Davenport include a bar and restaurant, a beauty shop, and additional home-based businesses. The town also has a park called Tuskind Park, named after the Davenport family that used to own the grocery store.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 125th celebration in the town where Mayor Jason Lotzer notes, "everybody knows everybody," will include a "Wagon Train," karaoke, a parade, a silent auction, all school reunion, and a variety of activities in Tuskind Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Davenport, ND, and its residents on their first 125  years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Davenport and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Davenport that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of  our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Davenport has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
