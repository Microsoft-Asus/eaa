  <narrative>WHY ARE WE STILL IN IRAQ? -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3190]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with this House on the threshold of granting the President $183 billion to continue the war in Iraq long past his term, it's an appropriate time to ask why are we still in Iraq, especially since the Democratic leadership promised the American people, 2 years ago, that if they voted Democrat, we'd move to end the war. Why are we still in Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we still in Iraq? Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, with al Qaeda's role in 9/11. Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction. Why have we lost 4,000 of our finest troops? Why have we seen tens of thousands of Americans injured? Why have we seen over a million innocent Iraqis killed?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war is based on lies. The Bible says, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. We need to start telling the truth here on this floor about the war in Iraq. And we need to end the war, end the occupation, close the bases, bring our troops home. Why are we still in Iraq?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a wake-up call for the American people. This is a wake-up call for the Congress. This is a wake-up call to stand for the truth.</paragraph>
