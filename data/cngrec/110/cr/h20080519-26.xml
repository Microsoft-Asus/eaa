    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="1132">H. Res. 1132</bill>, which seeks to commemorate the selfless men and women who serve as law enforcement officers around our country. Their service is crucial to the protection of Americans everywhere, and their daily sacrifice is what helps to guarantee our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1132">H. Res. 1132</bill> was introduced by Ted Poe of Texas on April 22, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2008 by voice vote. This legislative measure has the support of over 65 Members of Congress, and its principal purpose is to show our appreciation for the risk that 900,000-plus sworn law enforcement officers face daily in their service to communities throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this past year alone, our country has lost over 180 law enforcement officers in the line of duty, and while just last week many of their fellow officers descended upon our Nation's Capital for National Police Week in remembrance of these fallen heroes, today, we, in the Congress also take a moment to express our gratitude for these courageous Americans by recognizing Peace Officers Memorial Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, it is with humble gratitude that we salute and we thank our country's peace officers, as well as remember those officers who gave their life in service and protection of ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of <bill type="hr" number="1132">H. Res. 1132</bill> and reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I had the opportunity to vote it out of our committee week before last. We did so with full expectation that it would be on the floor last week, as has been traditional when law enforcement leaders come from around the country for our peace officers gathering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's with great trepidation that I support this, but also note that the partisan nature of our body, which has always caused this bill, in the past, to be up for that week so that the men and women could sit in the gallery and observe our recognition of the important work they do, did not happen. I would hope this is the last time that resolutions like this are held because, quote, we wouldn't get to them with all the recorded votes. The men and women, the 56,000-plus who are assaulted every  year, the 181 who died last year, up from 151 the year before, they deserve our recognition in a timely fashion. They deserve our constant support. They deserve not to be part of partisan infighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that, in fact, most of us in the Congress, including the gentlelady from California, shares with me the nonpartisan support for our law enforcement people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might additionally recognize at this time, that law enforcement is not only around the country, but it's also right here in the Capitol. We in the Congress could not do our business in an orderly fashion if it wasn't for the Capitol Hill Police who stand vigilantly with large weapons against an attack and, on a daily basis, ensure that the tens of thousands of people who come to see the Capitol are able to do so without interfering with the operations of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in the jobs large and small I would like to join with the gentlelady in asking for this bill to be passed, but I'd also like to recognize the men and women of the Capitol Hill Police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1132">H. Res. 1132</bill> supports the goals and ideals of Peace Officers Memorial Day to honor federal, state, and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, and encourages the citizens of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Law enforcement officers face dangers on the job every single day while fighting crime, violence and terrorism. On May 17, 1792, New York City's Deputy Sheriff, Isaac Smith, became the first police officer to be recorded as killed in the line of duty. Today, more than 56,000 officers are assaulted each year and just this past year, in 2007, 181 officers were killed while serving the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year was one of the deadliest years for U.S. law enforcement in nearly two decades. The number of officers killed in the line of duty last year increased nearly 20 percent from 2006, when there were 151 officer deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a quote by President George H.W. Bush engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, located at Judiciary Square here in D.C. that summarizes the mission of the 900,000 current sworn law enforcement officers in the United States. It states that it is their daily "quest to preserve both democracy and decency, and to protect a national treasure that we call the American dream."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May 15 was Peace Officers Memorial Day, a holiday created in 1961, by Congress to pay homage to the fallen law enforcement officers who have dedicated their lives to protecting this country and its citizens. On this day the flag is flown at half-staff and thousands of people visit the National Law Enforcement Memorial, which currently has 18,274 names engraved on its surface.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of these names is evidence of the sacrifices these brave law enforcement officers have made to keep American citizens safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With gratitude for our law enforcement officers' devotion and dedication, I ask all members to join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="1132">H. Res. 1132</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="1132">H. Res. 1132</bill>, Supporting the goals and ideals of Peace Officers Memorial Day, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Texas, Representative Ted Poe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace officers, the sworn, public-sector officers entrusted with law enforcement authority and the power of arrest, risk their lives daily to protect our Nation. These individuals, who are responsible for safeguarding the rights and freedoms we enjoy as Americans, are true heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peace Officers Memorial Day honors those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and security of their communities and our Nation. Created by Public Law 87-726, signed by President Kennedy in 1962, this day gives us the opportunity to acknowledge and pay our respects to those who, through their courageous deeds, have fallen in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Speaker, on thursday, May 15, 2008, our Nation will come together to honor, remember and record those law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty during the year of 2007. Mr. Speaker, one of the names of the fallen heroes added to the list last year was Officer Rodney J. Johnson of the Houston Police Department. Officer Johnson, a 12-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, was killed September 21, 2006, while taking a suspect in custody during a traffic stop. He leaves  to honor his memory his beloved wife, Houston Police Department Officer Joslyn Johnson, and five teen-aged children; three daughters and two sons, ages 14 to 19.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Rodney Johnson was born in Houston and served in the U.S. Army as a military police officer until being honorably discharged in 1990. He then went to work as a corrections officer for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and then as a jail attendant. He graduated from the Houston police academy in 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the department's Southeast Gang Task Force, Officer Rodney Johnson earned two Lifesaving Awards and one Medal of Valor from the State of Texas. In January 1998, Officer Rodney Johnson rescued a physically challenged driver trapped in rising floodwaters, and later that year he rescued mentally challenged people trapped inside of a burning house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Rodney Johnson, who stood 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed nearly 300 pounds, served on his union's board of directors. As Hans Marticiuc, the president of Officer Johnson's union stated, "he was big and he was intimidating-looking, but he was as gentle as a baby bear."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the number of officers killed in the line of duty has declined in recent years, the  fact that one officer is killed every 2 1/2  days in our country is a sober reminder that protecting our communities and safeguarding our democracy come at a heavy price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the total number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty was represented by 17,917 names engraved on the Memorial, representing officers from all 50 States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Federal law enforcement and military police agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution supports the goals and ideals of National Peace Officer Memorial Day, which honors Federal, State, and local peace officers killed or disabled in the line of duty. This service will honor the 181 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty during 2007, as well as the 900,000 officers who continue to serve in Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
