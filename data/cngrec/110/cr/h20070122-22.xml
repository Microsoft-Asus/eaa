    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>) to require the establishment of a national database in the National Archives to preserve records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction and to provide grants to State and local entities to establish similar local databases.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>, which authorizes the National Archives to preserve historical documents relating to servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction. Introduced by my friend, Representative Lantos of California, the bill calls on the Archives to place these documents in a searchable electronic database for use in historical and genealogical research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill> and chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives, I am pleased to see the measure presented for consideration by the House today. Under this legislation, grants will be made available to States, colleges and universities, and genealogical associations to preserve similar records in their possession and make them available electronically. The bill will for the first time make a wide range of historical documents relating  to servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction easily accessible and searchable. This will vastly improve the ability of African Americans to research their lineage. It will also facilitate the efforts of historians performing research into this period of American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An identical version of this bill was approved unanimously by the Committee on Government Reform last year. And as someone with a deep appreciation of African American and American history, I am honored to support its passage today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>, the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act, legislation which would establish a grant program, as outlined just a moment ago by Mr. Clay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill> would authorize the creation of a national database within the National Archives to include records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction held by Federal agencies. These records include: the Southern Claims Commission Records, Records of the Freedmen's Bank, Slave Impressment Records, Slave Payroll Records, and Slave Manifests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these records are not organized, catalogued, or well protected from the elements. <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill> will not only make these documents more accessible to the public but will preserve them as well. <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill> continues the important preservation efforts begun under the Freedmen's Bureau Records Preservation Act of 2000. The creation of a searchable database will help African Americans conduct genealogical research and learn more about their families' history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the national database will help historians and others interested in the Civil War and post-Civil War eras to conduct research that promises to reveal more about the history and culture of the South and the African American experience. Similar records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction are held by local and State entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill> authorizes the National Archives to provide grants to States, universities, and genealogical associations to digitally preserve their records through the creation of searchable databases. The digital preservation of these important historical documents and improved accessibility to them will ensure that they are available to future generations of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is legislation that all my colleagues can support, and I urge support for <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the sponsor of this legislation, Representative Lantos.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my dear friend, the distinguished chairman of the committee, for yielding me time and for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week our Nation paused to remember and to recognize the extraordinary life and achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>, the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act, which will help eliminate a little-known and rarely recognized vestige of slavery. This important legislation, which passed the Government Reform Committee last  year by a unanimous  vote, will open the way for African Americans to trace their ancestry from the critical period immediately following the end of slavery in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for most Americans, researching their genealogical history involves searching through various historical records, almost all of which have been properly archived as public historical documents. Unfortunately, African Americans face a unique challenge due to our Nation's history of discrimination and slavery. Instead of simply looking up wills, birth and death certificates, or other traditional genealogical research documents, African Americans are forced to identify the names of  former slave owners and then hope that these owners kept accurate records of pertinent property tax and probate information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compounding the difficulty of this problem, Mr. Speaker, is that many of these records of servitude and emancipation are frequently inaccessible, stored in farmhouses and schools throughout the South. Even when researchers are able to locate the records, they find them poorly catalogued and inadequately preserved from deterioration and decay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some States and some localities have undertaken efforts to collect these documents, and they need to be commended for their endeavors, a national effort to preserve these important pieces of public and personal history is necessary to ensure that they are readily and easily accessible to all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>, my legislation, builds on the success of the Freedmen's Bureau Records Preservation Act, which Congress passed and the President signed into law 6 years ago. That law required the archivists of the United States to catalogue the genealogical and historical records into a searchable indexing system and was the first step toward ensuring easy access. Passing <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill> is the next step necessary to complete this preservation project for our entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my bill tackles the problems of poorly catalogued and inadequately preserved records in two ways. First, it will make sure that the records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction currently being stored within the various agencies of the Federal Government will be properly preserved and accessible in a single electronic site. Second, the searchable index will allow individuals to access information in seconds rather than months or years to build their own personal  histories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Since many of these records are held in non-Federal public and private collections around the country, my legislation authorizes the National Archives to distribute grants to the States, academic institutions, and genealogical associations to locate, preserve, and establish on-line databases of these important records. These grants will ensure that families doing research in my home State of California or anywhere in the country will be able to find post-Civil War reconstruction items easily  accessible in a single electronic site. The searchable index will allow individuals to access information in mere seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal and local records covered by my legislation are not only of personal importance to the families involved, Mr. Speaker, they are historically significant to all of us. They document the reuniting of our Nation and the historic moment of transition for slaves from the status of property to citizens, a time when our country finally began to right a horrible moral wrong. We need to take the process another step now by ensuring that those records and the lessons they hold are preserved  for all eternity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis, both cosponsors of my legislation, for their continued support of this measure. I also want to thank my friend and colleague Elijah Cummings for all his efforts on this important measure. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense recognition that justice at long last must be made.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I simply want to commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for their work on this very important legislation. It has been an honor for me to manage this for the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge support of <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>, and yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing I want to thank my good friend from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) for his leadership on this issue. We appreciate it. I want to commend my good friend from California (Mr. Lantos) for sponsoring this bill that will catalog and preserve these records from a time long ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being a history enthusiast, I believe the adage that a people who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it, and I urge the House to pass the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill>, the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act. I support <bill type="h" number="390">H.R. 390</bill> because it will protect a vast amount of genealogical information from this period in our Nation's history. This bill authorizes the National Archives to do two things: (1) to use necessary resources to preserve, maintain and electronically catalogue these important records, and (2) to distribute grants to  the States, academic institutions, and genealogical associations in order to preserve and establish online databases of their own important local records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While most Americans can learn about their genealogy through already well-archived documents like certificates of birth, death, or marriage, African-Americans have more difficulty with this, due to our Nation's history of slavery and discrimination. African-Americans seeking information about their ancestors must instead turn to less well-archived records such as documents written by former slave owners. These records are often not very accessible, disorganized, or in poor condition, and so it  is important that we make every effort to adequately archive the familial records of so many of our Nations' citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would be the first national effort to preserve and protect this important part of our nation's history, and I thank Mr. LANTOS, the gentleman from California, for introducing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill, and I look forward to seeing it passed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives is truly a body of history. Each day we walk through the Capitol and stand where our Nation's first Members of Congress debated hundreds of years ago. Statues, plaques and paintings remind us of the past and inspire our future. In fact, every day history is recorded on the House floor through the records of our statements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not underestimate the importance of our Nation's past and our individual history. For many African Americans identifying their history and researching genealogy becomes challenging due to a lack of organized records. Many African Americans are left with piecing together records of their ancestors left from former slave owners or searching for information from the post-Civil War reconstruction. Many of these records are unorganized, inaccessible and quickly decaying. We need a national  effort to preserve these pieces of public and personal history or to make them readily and easily accessible to all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill the Federal Government will maintain an organized system for preserving the records of servitude, emancipation, and the post-Civil War. These records will include Southern Claims Commission Records, Records of the Freedmen's Bank, Slave Impressments Records, Slave Payroll Records, and Slave Manifests. This will go a long way towards preserving our past, and helping individuals discover their history as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues who everyday participate in this Nation's history to extend that dedication to preserving our past to vote for this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
