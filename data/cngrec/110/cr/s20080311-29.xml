    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Chaffey College as it celebrates its 125th anniversary. Throughout the past 125 years, the students, faculty, staff, and community have worked diligently to make Chaffey College a hallmark institution of higher learning in southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March 1883, brothers and engineers George and William Chaffey donated land and established an endowment for a private college to provide quality education to the citrus growing communities between the cities of Los Angeles and San Bernardino. The Chaffey brothers envisioned access to higher education throughout southern California for a burgeoning population, which would soon be realized by the dynamic growth of the college. The private school was initially founded as the Chaffey College of  Agriculture as part of the University of Southern California. A short time later the college had an enrollment of 100 students and began to receive joint funding through the local school district, allowing a period of dramatic growth to begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, Chaffey College has continued in its legacy of expansion, and it has taken great strides to provide increased opportunities for higher education throughout the region. It has developed satellite campus facilities in Ontario, Fontana and Chino. The education center in Chino is the only community college facility in California that is dedicated solely to information technology. And in May 2007, Chaffey College was able to dedicate six new buildings, including four science and technology  buildings, the Don Berz Excellence Building, and the Kane Center for Student Services and Administration. Today, Chaffey College offers a wide variety of both academic and vocational education courses to over 18,000 students, helping an entire region of students throughout multiple communities find a competitive edge in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chaffey College celebrates 125 years of growth and development in serving the communities of southern California, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to recognize its accomplishments. The success of our Nation and of future generations of Americans will be ensured by the continuing dedication and commitment of educational institutions such as Chaffey College.</paragraph>
