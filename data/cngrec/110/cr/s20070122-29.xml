  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Donald D. Junck of Sioux Falls, SD. In November of 2006, Donald submitted the one-millionth Trademark Electronic Application System, TEAS, filing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Donald currently owns two small businesses in Sioux Falls, SD: a construction company and a laser engraving company. He used TEAS to protect the name and logo of his mark, Bait Craft, which is used for his unique, handcrafted fishing tackle boxes. Fishing and other outdoor activities are an important part of South Dakota's heritage and are vital to our State's economy. Fishermen have spent $173 million and hunters $193 million in South Dakota over the last 5 years. TEAS has helped Donald and  many others in our State achieve the entrepreneurial success that creates jobs and keeps our economy moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, opened TEAS on a worldwide basis in 1998. TEAS is a cost-effective way to increase access and participation in the trademark process. This system allows trademark applicants, such as Donald Junck, to file an application at anytime and from any location with Internet access. TEAS has been a vital conduit in helping South Dakota's entrepreneurs protect their investments and improve their businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, along with the USPTO and Donald Junck's friends, family, and colleagues, I wish to recognize his most recent trademark application and the milestone one-millionth TEAS filing.</paragraph>
