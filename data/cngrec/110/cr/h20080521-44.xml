  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="TITLE IV--REVENUE PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends and colleagues, we now have an opportunity to reverse the trend that this great Nation has bound itself to, and that is, the addiction to oil as well as the lack of will to do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This great country has faced up to many crises, and the oil shortage just happens to be one. The question is do we have the will to look and to research and to find alternative means in which to meet the needs of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, I think today is the day that all of us are going to be proud of the initiatives that we have taken, the opportunities that are going to be given, the jobs that are going to be created, and the excitement in being able to say that the United States need not look to any Nation because of their vast resources in oil because we have the ingenuity and the ability to find alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is endless the possibilities that this will pursue in encouraging the production of electricity from renewable sources, using the wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, landfill gas and solid waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We even go as far as to have coal electricity plants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great opportunity for us and the world to explore these new areas that we just were too lazy or found no need to do, encouraging energy efficient products such as plug-in hybrid cars and incentives for conservation of energy in our buildings, whether they're residential or whether they're commercial. And I find it very exciting that we allow local government, that knows their communities better than we ever could, to issue tax credit bonds to further explore how we can conserve energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is merely a beginning, but it is an historic beginning that defies party lines. I do hope that we thank the Speaker and the chairman of the committee, the staffs who came together after working years on this project, to come together with a bill that's the beginning of the one that could be a new day for America, a new day for the world as we release our addiction and dependency on fossil fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another part of this bill that I come to you with mixed feelings and yet ask your support. It's called the extenders. What are the extenders, for the new Members? It's when people want bills passed, but they put expiration dates on them in order to hide the real cost of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that the ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means and I agree that we have so much garbage in this bill that soon I hope someone would have the courage to take a look at the tax bill that we have and strip it of the preferential treatment and get down to making the bills that we want permanent, and those that should not be permanent, just to kick them out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's a disgrace that we have a stimulus package and we have to target the middle class in order to be given handouts because they don't have enough money under our tax system to put food on the table, to provide tuition for their kids and put clothes on their back. We target them as being people who cannot afford to save and plan for the future. I think it is a disgrace for the Congress to have a tax system that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But because we make commitments and because some of these laws are good and efficient and because we don't have the money at this point in time to make it permanent, we come to you and ask you to support the extenders. These extenders include research and development, standard deduction for property taxes for non-itemizers. We have provisions in here to help Katrina. Expanded child credits. We make it more equitable how attorneys can write off their investments before the end of a case. We also  make it equitable for the moving picture industry to get the same benefits that other industries get as relates to job credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is one heck of an opportunity, I think, for us to move this forward in a short way. It's only a 1-year extension, which means that the next administration hopefully will be more progressive in terms of cleaning up the code and making permanent what should be made permanent. It is not paid in controversial taxes. We remove preferences for income that is made overseas and avoid tax liability, as well as tax benefits yet to be received. So there is no pain there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent at this time to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Washington, Dr. McDermott, for purposes of managing the bill, and to thank him and so many others on the Ways and Means Committee for their leadership, their patience, and being able to bring this bill to the floor. I'm fairly confident that we will have very little problem in the Senate and have this passed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So remember the date. It's historic in nature. And remember the role that you played in supporting this revolutionary approach to avoid the dependency on fossil fuel for our great Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the legislation before us today and urge all of my colleagues to vote against it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most critically, the bill claims to be a package of tax extenders, but fails to deal with the biggest and most pressing extender in the code, the AMT patch, the alternative minimum tax patch. This is a missed opportunity. We should have included that in this bill of other expiring provisions in the code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority's failure to extend this patch for 2008 would mean an additional 21 million--mostly middle class--individuals and families would be ensnared by the alternative minimum tax. As a result, affected families will pay an additional $61.5 billion in taxes for this year. This oversight--this neglect, I think--is the single largest flaw in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority, I'm sure, will claim during today's debate, just as they did during committee markup, that they will address the AMT before adjourning this year, just not now. Surely our experience from 2007, when the AMT patch wasn't enacted until the day after Christmas, suggests that maybe we ought to begin acting on this now and not just run down the shot clock. Mr. Speaker, it simply does not make sense to vote to extend dozens of tax provisions, some for several years, without also dealing  with the biggest and most far-reaching expiring provision, the AMT patch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also clings to the mistaken view that the House's PAYGO rules require us to raise taxes in order to prevent tax increases. I was pleased last year that, when the House finally did pass the AMT patch, we recognized the foolishness of applying PAYGO to expiring tax provisions, and I'm disappointed that that bipartisan approach is not being followed here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, we shouldn't have to pay to extend current law. This is not paying for a new tax cut in the main. Most of this bill is extending current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we stare at the prospect of a more than $3.5 trillion tax increase baked into the budget by the majority's misguided PAYGO rules, I think it will become even more obvious in the years to come why Congress should not have to raise taxes to prevent a tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the majority was ever willing to offset tax provisions with spending cuts, I might view this a little differently. But this bill shows once again that the only tool the majority has to meet its PAYGO requirements is the hammer of tax increases. It's little wonder, then, that to them every problem looks like a nail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I documented many times last year and during our committee markup last week, Washington doesn't have a revenue problem. We're getting enough revenues. We're already collecting more in taxes as a percent of our GDP than the historical average of revenues coming into Washington. That's not the problem. The problem is spending. So how many times have we had PAYGO rules be adopted and followed in this House using spending cuts to pay for extending current tax law? Zero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the continued use of tax increases to pay for extending current law is unacceptable to this ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and I hope will be objectionable to a majority of the Members of this House. In fact, this bill not only contains tax cuts, it actually does increase spending. There are items in this bill that score as spending--expanding refundable tax credits, the New York Liberty Zone project. Those score as spending. So we're increasing spending in this  bill, and we're paying for that with tax increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to those two provisions, the bill contains numerous other new temporary and permanent provisions, undermining the claim that the bill is merely extending current law. Some of the new provisions might be meritorious, but a few of those I think deserve closer examination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, some of my colleagues may be surprised to know that there is a nearly $1.6 billion special tax break for trial lawyers in this bill. The provision overrides developing case law and lets lawyers using certain types of contingency fee arrangements to deduct sooner their expenses. CBO's Joint Tax Committee scores this as costing the taxpayers $1.6 billion over the next 10 years. Now, this provision was not the subject, that I'm aware of, of any hearings or examination by the committee,  and yet it's in this bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that before we make such a significant change in tax law costing taxpayers $1.6 billion, all going to one very narrow set of people in this country, trial lawyers, that we would want to have a hearing on that and flesh it out to see if maybe it could be crafted better, or whether, in fact, it's of any value at all to the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also revisits the "green pork" tax credit bonds that were much discussed during the energy debate in 2007. These are the same bond proceeds, remember, that could be used for all sorts of dubious projects, maybe hybrid snowmobiles in Aspen, or maybe a new Wal-Mart with a couple of solar panels out front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State and local governments using the bond proceeds don't even have to certify that the projects will reduce fossil fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, the majority rejected a sensible fix for this oversight when this was offered last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know how this is all going to end. It will end with the passage of an AMT patch without offsets, like last year, and probably many extenders being approved without tax increases. More than 40 Senators have signed a letter pledging to oppose a package such as the one before the House today. And even if it somehow squeaks by the Senate, the President has indicated he would veto this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's unfortunate that the majority has chosen against moving a bill on expiring provisions that could have had bipartisan support and instead have opted for the measure before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that its fate has already been sealed--it won't become law--I am comforted to know that we will have another chance to consider this legislation this year. I hope it's sooner rather than later so that we're not here in December once again scrambling to deal with these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can do better than what's before us today. Let's get rid of this, start over, and bring a good bill back.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of affection and I have a great deal of respect for the ranking member on the other side, but you are dead wrong on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, you talk about this side of the aisle not being able to pass AMT. We did pass legislation, and your side sunk it. The alternative minimum tax would be gone, it would be abolished, there would be nada there, but you decided, for whatever reason, that you didn't want to pay for it. That's the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle are determined not to support this legislation. It should be noted that entities such as Goldman Sachs--I mean, these are not, most of the time, our friends--Bank of America, Caterpillar, Ford, Deere, and Prudential disagree with you, and they publicly support the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Connect the dots here. After all, a number of important provisions, such as the critical research and development credit, the election to deduct State and local general sales tax, the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for qualified leasehold improvements, and the election to expense brownfields environmental remediation costs have already expired. These provisions are so important to American businesses and consumers, and the time to renew them is now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a wide array of important provisions here, from renewable energy incentives to middle class tax cuts. I want to add how grateful we should all be to Chairman Rangel for his decision to include a 1-year extension on the active financing rules critical to global competitiveness of U.S. financial services and companies. Those companies in this country that export are at a tremendous disadvantage. We are not playing on a level playing field. Active financing rules provide American  companies with the level playing field necessary to compete in the global marketplace. Most other countries don't try to extract any taxes on its companies' foreign-based operations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in fact, I agree with much of what the gentleman just said. I'm happy to hear him endorse many provisions that we, I think wisely, put into the Jobs bill several years ago when we were in the majority. So it's not those provisions that I oppose, it's the tax increases in the bill to pay for just extending current law that I'm opposed to. And I want to make that clear. I like the provisions the gentleman mentioned.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I want to express my support for the tax relief included in today's legislation, provisions such as the research and development tax credit and the active financing exception that help our employers stay competitive and the extension of the renewable energy tax incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I cannot support this bill as written. First, it continues the negative trend the Democrat majority has followed by permanently increasing taxes to pay for temporary extensions of existing tax law. Given the wide-ranging tax relief that is set to expire in the coming years, the Democrats' PAYGO logic would require us to raise taxes by more than $3.5 trillion between now and 2018.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the bill "dodges" extending the middle class alternative minimum tax patch, without which 24 million taxpayers will pay an average of $2,400 in AMT taxes in 2008 alone. We waited until the 11th hour to extend this relief in 2007. We cannot do so again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, the House Democrats refuse to work on these issues on a bipartisan basis. Their tax increase approach has been tried and tried again, and for what we have seen in the other body and from what the White House has said, it will fail again. The longer we delay passing a realistic extenders bill, the longer American employers and taxpayers go without this critical tax relief.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is pro-environment, it's business friendly, and it's paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know how anybody on the other side can mention the words "alternative minimum tax" with a straight face. They had sufficient opportunity in the last session of the Congress to vote for a responsible alternative minimum tax repeal. I know. I authored the legislation. They all voted against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Charlie Rangel today for his hard work. There are a number of business and individual tax incentives that lapsed in January of this year. There was urgency to getting it done, and we did precisely that. In my home State of Massachusetts this means that 94,000 teachers will get a deduction for out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies. It means that a thousand businesses in Massachusetts will get some credit for the millions they spend on research here in the United  States. Without this bill 121,000 families in Massachusetts cannot take deduction for college tuition expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides significant and real tax relief to millions of families nationwide and for some very low income families it will provide a new benefit. There are 111,000 children in Massachusetts whose families will get a higher tax credit because of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are an additional 32,000 children and families in Massachusetts who are currently shut out of the child tax credit because of the threshold for earnings that must exceed rises each year for inflation. They're simply too poor for the tax credit. This bill lowers the threshold so that these working families can benefit from the child tax credit just like other families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are well-crafted positions, and we don't have time to mention them all. But I want to tell you in the 20 years I have been in this House, this is one of the best pieces of legislation that I have been associated with. It provides tax relief, but at the same time it's pro-environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that Members of this House on both sides will support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's surprising how well the Democrat majority can turn good ideas like the extension of tax relief into bad legislation. Now, we have seen it before and it usually ends in gridlock. And, frankly, the American people are tired of the majority party's record of stalemate and zero accomplishment. But here we go again with another bill that is headed nowhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill could have easily passed the Ways and Means Committee and passed on the floor with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of votes. It failed to get a majority of Republican votes in committee and will likely fail to get a Republican majority here today on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interestingly, a lot of what is in this package was written when Republicans were in the majority. The Republican bill was devoted to tax incentives; the  Democrat bill focuses on tax increase. This is a fundamental difference between our two parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a real missed opportunity not to deal with the alternative minimum tax, which means higher taxes for more and more Americans. That's why you're seeing key groups oppose this bill like the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, Americans for Tax Reform, Alliance for Worker Freedom, Americans for Prosperity, and Club for Growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what the Democrats give with one hand they take with the other. They'll use words like "PAYGO" and "revenue raisers," but the fact of the matter is those innocent-sounding words really mean tax increases. Permanently increasing taxes to pay for temporary tax incentives is a losing deal for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress will be confronted with many more expiring tax provisions in the coming years, and if the Democrats continue with this flawed logic, taxpayers will be hit with more than $3.5 trillion in tax increases between now and 2018 simply to maintain current law. With $3 and possibly $4 of gas and higher grocery bills, a sluggish economy, and a downturn in the housing market, the American public cannot afford higher taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need a fortune teller to tell us that, just like many of the other bills House Democrats have passed that included tax increases, this bill again is dead on arrival in the United States Senate. So we will be back here again at some point debating this bill again. So after we get through with today's exercise, hopefully we can get down to business and write a bill that will gain a majority of bipartisan support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation has vital energy provisions. Vital. It has important tax provisions, including the R&amp;D tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we hear the Republicans opposing it. They did not know how to govern effectively when they were in the majority, and they're showing today they don't know how to oppose effectively when they're in the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They criticize PAYGO. Their creed is "pay-no." They don't want to pay for anything. They oppose a tax provision to close a loophole, an egregious one, and they call that a tax increase. They say this is their principle: Don't pay for extending current tax law, even though the reason it meets its end is because they didn't want to extend it a few years ago and increase the deficit. What illogic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They say do further with the extenders, but they don't want to pay for it. They say do more right now on the AMT but don't pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to keep working on the AMT. We're going to keep trying to pay for it. The reason this may not succeed in the Senate is because of the minority Republicans and in the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the public is tired of this blockade. We will keep moving ahead and I hope with success. It's time to act. I hope there will be some minority support for this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't know what's being sold around here today, but there is nothing revolutionary about this bill. There are some good things in it, no question. But it is dangerously incomplete and it is tainted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It includes a last-minute special interest provision that no one in America has ever had a chance to look at or consider. It is not revolutionary because it includes extensions of what's already law in America today, the research and development tax credit, that's so important to innovation America. The State and local sales tax deduction, important for families to deduct what they pay in sales taxes from what they owe Uncle Sam because sales taxes really add up fast, especially for younger families.  Energy provisions, which are important for us to do renewable alternative fuels. All that is very good. Everyone supports it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is dangerously incomplete because it does not address a huge looming tax increase on most of middle class America. The alternative minimum tax, the second tax, that families find when they do their taxes or do their software for taxes, and they're okay, they don't owe Uncle Sam anything. We catch them with a second tax. And we said over the years that we'll do away with that. Republicans did do away with that second tax. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed it, and we live with it  today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does nothing to stop the alternative minimum tax, the second tax, on American families, and we need to act now, not later to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is tainted because it includes a provision, $1.6 billion, a new tax break, for one special interest group, plaintiffs' attorneys with contingency fees. The wealthiest 1 percent of attorneys in America will receive $1.5 billion more of your money.</paragraph>

Instead of helping a trial lawyer buy a second private jet, why don't we help a waitress who's trying to raise her kids? Wouldn't that be a fair use of help and dollars?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm surprised to hear my Republican friends talk about their dismay that AMT is not in this package. AMT was not in the President's budget, not one nickel, not one cent. I never heard one word in the Ways and Means Committee, not a word that I can recall, of dismay from my Republicans that the President didn't address AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill before us is to address a number of expiring provisions including energy. Good gosh, with oil approaching $130 a barrel, you would think we could bust out an energy portion and make an immediate response. The American people deserve no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just take, for example, one provision: The wind production tax credit expires at the end of the year. But to be effective, a wind power plant has to be invested, constructed, and turning energy in order to qualify under the 2008 provision for the production tax credit. What that means in real terms is that already activity is being placed at risk. Financing packages are being denied for growing wind power in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our upside potential on harnessing power for wind is immense. But even the, I'd say paltry, 1-year extension under the bill, because this industry deserves much more than 1 year, is placed at risk now by Republican opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fundamentally, we believe if we are going to extend these tax provisions, we need to find revenue offsets so that we don't drive the deficit deeper. I think what this debate is really about is a very different vision. They're happy to just run up the debt even deeper by extending these provisions without the pay-fors. We refuse to do that. As important as these provisions are, we are not going to let our kids pay for them. We will pay for them right here and now by finding the appropriate offsets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for the interest of the people in this country in getting renewable energy sources, especially wind power, let's advance this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I listened to my good friend, CHARLIE RANGEL, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, from New York, a while ago, and he was talking about all these areas where we are going to get additional energy. There were some great ideas there. The problem is many of them are going to take a long, long time before we get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, people in this country are paying close to $4 a gallon for gasoline, and the issue is we have a supply of oil in this country that will take care of most of the problem. We can drill in the ANWR and get a million to 2 million barrels of oil a day. That is three-and-a-half times the size of Texas, Alaska is, and we can't do it because they say it's environmentally dangerous. We can drill off the Continental Shelf and get a million to 2 million barrels of oil a day. They won't let us  drill off the Continental Shelf, and yet Cuba is going to drill within 50 miles of the United States and give the oil to China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are using all these environmentally questionable issues to keep us from drilling for oil in this country to be energy independent. We have been talking about energy independence for 30, 40 years, and we haven't done a darn thing about it. The Speaker said here not long ago, about 2 years ago, they were going to do something about skyrocketing gas prices when it was $2.33 gallon. Now it's approaching $4 a gallon and we can't even drill for oil that's in our country to reduce the cost of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want solutions. They want Democrats and Republicans to come together and do what is necessary to help them with their energy problems. They want us to work together. We need to have some balance between environmental concerns and the cost that we need to deal with regarding this economy, and that means we need to lower the price of energy, especially gasoline, so people can get to and from work and deal with the problems they face on a daily basis. There's no question about  that. Gasoline should not be $4 a gallon, and we can lower it if we drill for oil in our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We can do it. But we will never do it unless we work together, Democrats and Republicans. All I hear from the other side of the aisle is, No; we have to worry about the environment.

    <paragraph>What you're hearing today, just the last speaker says, let's drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or go hat in hand to OPEC and say, Please produce more oil. Or let's have some more secret meetings down in the White House with the Vice President and design a new tax policy that will get our oil prices even higher. They met in the first months in the White House and decided how to drive up the oil prices for the oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to implement a tax plan that uses the Tax Code to produce renewable energy to put us on a path to providing our children with an energy-independent future. The plan creates incentives for America to apply technology and use practices to use energy more efficiently than the way we are presently doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a time a long time ago when the United States led in alternative energy. But now Denmark, Japan and Germany are far ahead of us because of 8 years of this present administration and their attitudes toward alternative energy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We are for extending these good tax policies on research and development, we are for extending these good tax policies on energy research particularly. As Republicans, as conservatives, as people who actually brought these tax policies to the table to start with, of course we are for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now a 1-year extension is not the right amount of time. We can debate that. I hope we have time to because this is not the last day we are going to see this bill. If you're really serious about energy research, try to go to borrow money with a 1-year plan. You can't borrow money with a 1-year plan. You can't take a chance with a 1-year plan. You can't hire people with a 1-year plan. Surely, everybody here knows that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we were really serious about extending these policies, we would be sending signals that we are committed to these policies for a long time. But we are for the policies that we are talking about in current law. We are not nearly as excited about the new things that are added; the tax breaks for lawyers who have taken a case on contingency and now want taxpayers to subsidize their dealing with that case by these new ideas in the Tax Code. But we are for the continuation of good policies. But  we are not for believing that to continue good tax policies, you have to pay for those by taxing other people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If these tax policies are good enough for now, they are good enough to continue to be the policies of the future. This House decided last year on the alternative minimum tax that, well, we don't want more people to slip into that bad tax situation so we are going to move forward without having taxes that replace what would happen if we didn't try to maintain the current status of taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we are for, maintaining current policies, giving them as much life as possible, and not assuming that other taxpayers have to suffer in an economy that we need to be sending signs of growth and productivity to, not signs of more ideas for the Federal Government to increase taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can come back to a bill that extends good policy, that does it for a longer period of time, and doesn't seem to feel it's necessary to tax other people to extend policies that are working in the Tax Code today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The prior speaker said you can't have a plan for 1 year. What he didn't mention is that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress hadn't had a plan for 7 years, and look where it's gotten us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is a lot of people want to talk about you have to have a balanced approach. That's true. You do have to have some drilling. There are 9,300 permits owned by the oil companies here in the United States for drilling that they do not use. Close to 72 percent. They don't use. They are not drilling. Could alleviate today. They are waiting for the price to increase before they drill. Those permits have been issued. So that is part of a plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are talking about today is seizing future energy sources, be that wind, solar, biomass. In fact, today, the  Wall Street Journal, lead story, the Pentagon knows and it is launching, according to the headline, an alternative fuels strategy. The Pentagon knows that. Corporate America is investing in alternative energy sources. They know that. The American consumer knows you have got to have a different strategy than the one that depends only on  oil. The only people that don't know that you need to have a diverse energy policy is the White House and sometimes I believe some of the Republican Members of Congress here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need an energy policy so it begins to invest in 21st century energy sources, like wind and solar, and stop subsidizing 20th century energy sources, which is only oil. This gives us an agenda, a strategy to look to the future, build new technologies, new industries that will employ hundreds of thousands of people, and invest and give America its energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it does not cost the American taxpayer. This is a paid-for piece of legislation by closing offshore deferrals where a lot of people hide their income in offshore deferrals. In fact, Congressman McCrery and Senator Grassley both acknowledge it is a decent way to pay for something. Whether they agree for this, they do agree it's a legitimate pay-for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, there's a lot of talk about middle class and the suffering in the middle class. This legislation provides property tax relief for middle class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember that this is the first step toward energy independence and making sure that we build on the progress we have made, such as CAFE standards for cars.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I really believe that we need to have our own American-made energy, and we have the resources here. I have been a leading advocate in Energy and Commerce on alternative energies, on wind, solar, geothermal, closed-loop biomass and cellulosic ethanol, and these tax credits, I think, are important in that process. We need to have a complete portfolio that includes alternatives, these types of alternatives. But I have to say that I am disappointed greatly in the fact that  we are extending these for 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have sat down with the leading folks in especially wind energy. And, by the way, let's not confuse these sources that generate electricity with putting fuel in our cars. Most of these generate electricity, like wind. We need it. But they can't take their business plan to the bank on a 1-year tax credit. They said they need at least a 5-year, and prefer a 10-year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are very serious about making alternatives part of our energy portfolio, we need a 5- to 10-year plan to extend these tax credits. Otherwise, we are just simply perpetrating a hoax upon the American public that is looking towards Congress to find a way to alleviate the pressures of high gas costs. It is about what they are paying when they pull up to the pumps. So if we are serious about it, let's do a long-term tax credit bill that is actually going to be usable by the folks that want  to invest in these alternatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we do a little bit better job on solar. I am surprised that they pulled one out and treated that so specially, when all the others are just so meritorious. And, by the way, I am not sure we have gotten to the technology yet where we can have wind panels and solar panels operating our cars for us. They can generate electricity if we want to do a plug-in, but even that we are not doing a long-term plan for.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to commend Mr. Rangel and Mr. Neal for an outstanding piece of legislation that they have put before us. I am particularly pleased with the extension of credits as it relates to fuel cell and geothermal technology, but wind and solar as well. To extend these credits in a manner that will allow us to become energy independent is something that is long overdue for this Nation. Let us hope that our colleagues on the other side are able to join us in making sure that we take  a positive step forward for the future of energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What seems apparently is the stumbling block on the other side is that we are providing that we pay for this, and that we are doing so by, well, taxing a group of people who otherwise go untaxed and yet reap all the benefits of this great Nation. But those poor hedge fund guys who sequester their funds offshore and are making millions of dollars, to subjugate them to a tax, oh, just the thought of it sends a shudder up the spines of our dear friends on the other side. Imagine the people back  home, the people that they talk about, that Mr. Burton said need this relief immediately. But to do so by taxing offshore hedge funds? Well, we can't have a part of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for this country to get serious about energy independence. It is time for us to step up to the plate and for Americans to understand that people who are making funds offshore paying no taxes ought to contribute to making sure that we are able to move  this Nation forward in the direction of energy independence.</paragraph>

The tenets of sound tax policy begin with the notion of equity, efficiency and simplicity. Relying on the traditional framework, I am certain that we are driving towards a rational consensus.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE TUBBS-JONES: I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership in the Ways &amp; Means Committee's consideration of <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. House passage of <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, including the so-called CFC Look-through rule, is very important for us to remain competitive in markets around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your efforts to include the extension, the so-called CFC Look-through rule in <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, were critical to the ability of P&amp;G, and many other American companies, to serve our customers and consumers around the world.

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been some stark differences in the debate here today, but there is one thing that is clear: There is a clear record of failed fiscal discipline on the part of our friends on the Republican side of the aisle; 12 years of failure to deal with the alternative minimum tax, including 6 years of that time when they controlled the entire process, their failure to cut spending while they borrowed money on our children's credit card to give tax benefits to those who need it the least, and for  12 years they refused to fix the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is going to be a new era in Washington in 242 days where we will be able to deal comprehensively with tax reform, and I look forward to it. But, in the meantime, it is critical to give Americans more energy choices, and this legislation does precisely that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, it would extend the investment tax credit that deals with renewable energy. When the PTC for wind energy expired at the end of 2003, the installation of new wind capacity dropped 77 percent in the next year. A recent analysis by our friends in the wind and solar industries suggest that we are looking at $19 billion of lost investment and 116,000 lost job opportunities if we fail to act on the extension. This will set us back not just in terms of the challenge of wind and solar  energy today, but we are going to lose ground to our competitors overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge that we focus on the need to provide more energy choices for Americans today. Extending these credits is a way to make a difference this year. Failure to do so is going to cause unnecessary disruption, not just in terms of energy, but economically as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that this is one area where we ought to be able to work together, agree with these responsible provisions, and enact it into law.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise in support of the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. I am enthusiastic about it because it will cut taxes for millions of middle-income families and grow the U.S. economy, it will invest in renewable energy technologies to create high-paying green jobs, it will make us more energy independent, and it will remove incentives in the Tax Code that encourage shipping jobs and investments overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. CHARLIE RANGEL. He has brought a bill to the floor that makes key investments in our families and our future. And I thank the gentleman from Washington State, Mr. McDermott, for his leadership and for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is how the bill will cut taxes. Here are seven reasons why everybody in this Congress should vote for this bill. Any one of them should be enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it provides 30 million homeowners with property tax relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it helps 13 million children by expanding the child tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it benefits 11 million families through the State and local sales tax deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, it helps 4.5 million families better afford college with tuition deductions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, it saves 3.4 million teachers money with a deduction for classroom expenses. Imagine now when our teachers go into classrooms that are not fully equipped. They have to pay for that equipment themselves. This at least says if you do that, you will get a tax deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides more than 22,000 military families with tax relief under the earned income tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it ensures U.S. competitiveness by expanding the research and development tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is how it cuts taxes. There are seven reasons right there, any one of which I think is sufficient to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it comes to gas prices, Mr. Speaker, as we debate this legislation American families are paying record prices at the pump. Yesterday the cost of a barrel of oil passed $129 for the first time in history. Today I believe it went past $130. This legislation invests in the future and the ingenuity of the American people to create and deploy cutting-edge renewable technologies that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and this is how it does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It strengthens and extends the production tax credit which will spur the deployment of wind, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, tidal and landfill gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, it transitions biofuel beyond corn by creating a new tax credit to promote the production of cellulosic biofuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, it expands and extends the solar and fuel cell investment tax credit and offers tax incentives for residential, solar, wind and geothermal technologies. It provides tax incentives for coal electricity plants that capture and  sequester carbon dioxide. It includes incentives to encourage energy efficient products, such as plug-in hybrid cars and incentives for energy conservation, both in commercial buildings and residential structures. And it creates  a new category of tax credit bonds to fund local initiatives to promote the deployment of green technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a comprehensive approach, the missing part of the energy bill that we passed last year because it did not have the tax credits. Now we do. This industry can take off. We can have private sector initiatives to grow our economy, create good-paying jobs here at home, green jobs, and have the green economic revolution that is so important to our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is all being done in a fiscally sound way. No new deficit spending. It is paid for. This forward-looking legislation invests in renewable energy, creates hundreds of thousands of good-paying green jobs, spurs American innovation, and cuts taxes, cuts taxes, for millions of Americans. And it does so, as I mentioned, in a fiscally responsible way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To invest in our future, this bill closes loopholes allowing corporations and executives to avoid paying certain taxes by shipping jobs and investments overseas. The New Direction Congress thinks we should focus tax benefits on creating jobs and encouraging investments here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the strong case for rescinding taxpayer subsidies for big oil companies making record profits, opposition by the Senate Republicans to these offsets makes their inclusion untenable for the bill being debated today. But we will come back to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Today's bill represents a concerted effort to enact a bill into law promptly, and thus relies on revenue offsets that enjoy strong bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join Mr. Rangel and members of the Ways and Means Committee and Members of our House on both sides of the aisle who care about an energy future for America that reduces our dependence on foreign oil. It is a national security issue, it is an economic issue, it is an environmental and health issue, it is an energy issue, it is a moral issue for us to preserve God's beautiful creation, this planet, and to pass it on to the next generation in a responsible way.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I listened to the Speaker of the House who spoke so eloquently about the pain Americans are feeling at the gas pump. She and her party should know a lot about it. They helped cause it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the Democrats have been in control here for almost a year and a half, we have seen prices at the pump go up about $1.50 a gallon. A barrel of oil is at the highest price we have ever seen. They have tried to sue their way into lower gas prices. Now they are trying to tax their way into lower gas prices. Yet they never think about producing American energy in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now we have the so-called tax extender bills, Mr. Speaker. Well, isn't that an interesting concept. Why is it that spending is forever and grows exponentially, and yet tax relief to hardworking middle-income families is somehow temporary? It just kind of disappears. But the Speaker of the House tells us that this is somehow fiscally responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you read the front page of USA Today 2 days ago, it tells you that under the Democrats' watch we have an extra $2.7 trillion of unfunded obligations that are put upon our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Apparently the majority leader thinks that is a laughing matter. As the father of a 6-year-old and the father of a 4-year-old, I don't find it too funny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have here is we are going to preserve tax relief for some by increasing taxes for others. Again, what an interesting concept. The bottom line is the job creation mechanism of America is taxed, taxed again when people's paychecks are shrinking. This isn't fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now some people say, well, these particular provisions need reform. I am happy to reform the Tax Code. I have cosponsored the Taxpayer Choice Act of 2008. I invite my Democrat colleagues to cosponsor it so that we can present a two-tier flat tax system to the American people. But the bottom line is Washington is spending too much, and we don't need another tax increase bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Gas prices are up around $4 a gallon. Climate change is a clear and present  danger. We need to wean ourselves off of largely imported foreign sources of fossil fuel. This bill charts that new course, the right course. It provides critical incentives for accelerated energy production from wind, geothermal, and hydropower sources. It includes investment tax credits for solar and fuel cell properties and a number of other factors.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me address the contingency fee provision that has come up several times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. McCrery, I agree with you that contingency fee lawyers are a very, very narrow class of people. They are the only major business in America that gets paid solely based on how effective they are. If they earn nothing for their client, they get nothing in the way of compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another fact for my friends on the minority: Contingency fee lawyers are small business owners who run up expenses, like every other small business in America. Simple tax fairness says they ought to be able to take the expenses when the expenses occur. That is how we grow businesses in America, we give people a chance to use the Tax Code to grow. And if every other business in America can take a deduction for expenses in the year in which you incur the expense, how dare we single out one class  of small business owners and treat them differently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision is a simple clear matter of tax equity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time to close, using the majority leader.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me close today by simply saying that we don't object to the main body of the bill, the extensions of the expiring provisions of the Tax Code. After all, those were provisions that we put in the Tax Code when we were in the majority. That is not the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point is that if we follow the PAYGO rules that require these existing provisions of law to be paid for if they are extended just amounts to a built-in tax increase. If we are already bringing in to the Federal Government more money as a percent of GDP than we historically have with all these provisions in place, what sense does it make to raise taxes just to keep them in place? It doesn't make sense, unless you simply want to raise more revenue for the central government in this country,  grow the government even more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to those who have spoken so eloquently on the merits of the expiring tax provisions, I agree with that. But to hold to the PAYGO provisions that require the offsets in this bill would lead us to a huge tax increase over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Maryland, the majority leader to close the debate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to say how much respect I have for Mr. McCrery. I think he is one of the most positive Members of this body. I think he has worked productively with Chairman Rangel, and I have great respect for my colleague. He will be leaving, and that will be a loss for the Congress. I wanted to say that before I begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that we have disagreements. However, and on the overall issue that he raised in closing about paying for this, he is accurate. Now, some of these extenders even pre-date the time when the Republicans were in the majority in 1995 and through 2006. But I think there is consensus on extending them. The difference is, should we pay for them? There are only a number of options, a few options available to us. We can pay for them, or our children can pay for them. Somebody will pay for them.  There is not a free lunch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My view is this supply side economics pretends there is somewhere out there where the tooth fairy is going to deliver the money. There is not a tooth fairy. It is the parent who delivers the money under the pillow when the tooth is lost. But we are the parents, and we need to act as adults. We need to pay for what we buy. And if what we buy is giving somebody a tax incentive because we believe that they will do something good that will advantage our community and our country, then that is fine.  I am supportive of that. But we ought to pay for it, because that is our decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>One of the gentlemen spoke about his two children. I have three children. I have three grandchildren, and I have one great-granddaughter. I'm equally concerned. I'm concerned about the $4 trillion in debt that we've added over the last 6-plus years, and now some $400 billion this year alone. But that is the general philosophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The specific philosophy here is we need to be energy independent. We need to be sure that our policies that we pursue do not continue to make us hostage to those who have petroleum products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I first want to commend Chairman CHARLIE RANGEL and all of the members of the Ways and Means Committee for their hard work on this very important, farsighted legislation, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week the American people are paying, on average, $3.79 per gallon for gasoline. Mr. Hensarling observed that I was laughing when he said the Democrats have been in charge and look what's happened to gas prices. I was laughing because the absurdity is rejected by the American public, that somehow policies that we've adopted over the last year, when the President vetoes anything he doesn't want, has affected those gasoline prices to me is patently absurd and clearly rejected by the  American people. It was, I thought then and think now, a laughable proposition to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Motorists are paying $4 per gallon, more than $2.50 per gallon more than they were paying when the current administration took office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show you the difference, when Bill Clinton was President from 1993 to 2001, gas prices rose from $1.06 to $1.46, 40 cents, or a nickel a year, a nickel a year during those 8 years. During this President's administration, prices are rising a nickel a week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that this explosion in gasoline prices is squeezing hardworking families who live in every one of our districts who also are coping with the rising costs of food and groceries, health care and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is not a panacea to those immediate concerns. Would that we had one. But it does represent an important step in our continuing effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among other things, the bill will establish a new tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic biofuel production from now through 2015, so that we can rely on the Middle West and perhaps other parts of our country, rather than the Middle East. It will extend this $1 per gallon biodiesel tax credit, and makes it available to all potential sources of diesel that can be made without petroleum. And it allows jet fuel produced from biomass to qualify for the credit as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this legislation will reduce our dependence on imported fuel for our electricity sector by extending and expanding tax incentive for sources of renewable energy including wind, solar and biomass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also will encourage the use of plug-in hybrid cars and provide incentives for energy conservation in residential homes, commercial buildings and appliances; all of which, I think, the American public applauds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, this bill will help create hundreds of thousands of "green jobs." It will spur American innovation and business investment, which will strengthen our economy today and in the future. And it will provide tax relief for millions of Americans, expanding the child tax credit for the families of 13 million children, helping 4.5 million families better afford college through a tuition deduction, and saving 3.4 million teachers money with a deduction for classroom expenses, so when they  buy something for their classroom, like a business expense, they'll be able to deduct it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, many on the Republican side object to this bill because the Democratic majority, in keeping with our commitment to fiscal responsibility and pay as you go budget rules, insists that this legislation be paid for and not add to the national debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's a fundamental difference between our two sides. One believes that tax cuts somehow pay for themselves. Mr. Bernanke doesn't believe that, Mr. Greenspan doesn't believe that, but our Republican colleagues clearly believe it, and they've pursued that policy, which has, as I said, put us over $3 trillion in additional debt over the last 82 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To them I simply say: It is long past time that the Members here insist that our Nation pay for the things it buys. To not do so takes the discipline out of the democratic process, because if we can simply charge that which we buy, there will be no discipline on the part of the electorate to say no, we don't want to be taxed to buy that. And I guarantee the system would stop buying it. But if there is no discipline, if we're not paying, my grandchildren will not be able to vote and exercise that  discipline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History, I suggest to my colleagues, is littered with the stories of formerly great nations that began their demise through fiscal profligacy. It is within our power to ensure that the United States of America is never added to that list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The method by which Chairman Rangel and the committee have paid for the cost of this bill is laudable. Important. This legislation closes loopholes that allow corporations and executives to avoid U.S. taxes by shipping jobs and investments overseas. And because our obligations do not stop, average working Americans, therefore, must pay more if the wealthiest among us who can seek tax havens do not pay their fair share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent bill that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our environment, create thousands of jobs and strengthen our economy, and provide tax relief to millions of hardworking Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Mr. Rangel, Mr. McDermott, the members of the committee, and I commend Mr. McCrery for his responsible stewardship as the ranking member and his working to try to bring consensus. We have not reached it in this instance, but I do commend him for his efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I urge my colleagues, support this important legislation which moves us towards energy independence and a fair and equitable tax system.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412258" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. This is a fiscally responsible and progressive piece of legislation. <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> responds to the concerns we consistently hear from our constituents about energy prices, property taxes and the needs of our brave men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> recognizes that the need for renewable energy is greater than ever. Oil companies reap higher and higher profits but consumers are struggling to keep up the rising cost of gas. Our dependence on foreign oil continues to pose a serious risk to our national security. Further, we know our current energy sources are contributing heavily to global climate change. I applaud <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> for including a $20 billion dollar investment in renewable energy research and production to find environmentally  sound alternate energy supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home state of Indiana, families are struggling to keep up with sky-high property taxes. My colleague Baron Hill has worked to bring about relief for homeowners and introduced <bill type="h" number="3726">H.R. 3726</bill> the Property Tax Relief Act of 2007, a bill I am proud cosponsor. I was pleased to note the bill we are discussing today provides an additional standard deduction for State and local real property taxes paid for 2008, a provision very similar to <bill type="h" number="3726">H.R. 3726</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also provides assistance to our veterans and active duty service men and women. <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> includes provisions allowing members of the armed services to include combat pay in order to qualify for the earned income tax credit and rules to allow veterans to qualify for mortgage revenue bonds. These programs offer critical assistance to lower income individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> helps American families by extending the deduction for qualified tuition and related education expenses and increasing the eligibility for the refundable child tax credit for 2008. Further, it rejects President Bush's attempts to cut down Medicare and Medicaid benefits, the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and several key law enforcement programs. Having spent my career in law enforcement, I was especially concerned to hear  that the President proposed eliminating the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants and cops. I am pleased this bill continues to support these important programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman Rangel for his leadership on this important bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation that will extend critical tax credits for renewable energy and for American families while not adding to the federal deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chair of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I am especially pleased to see the House take action on needed tax credits for renewable energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) in particular has been instrumental in promoting the creation of a renewable energy industry. An extended  PTC will provide more market certainty and we must have an extension of this key tax credit before the current credit expires at the end of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must add that, while I am pleased that the bill provides a 3-year extension of the PTC for most renewable energy sources, I am concerned that it only provides a 1-year extension for wind energy. Wind is a very promising renewable energy source and a 1-year extension will not be as helpful for the industry. I will continue to lead the fight to extend the PTC for more than 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also extends the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy, qualified fuel cells, and microturbines through the end of 2014. The ITC will help companies with initial investment costs in expanding these renewable energy sources across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also authorizes $2 billion of new clean renewable energy bonds (CREBS) for public power providers and electric cooperatives. This is a critical tool, especially for Colorado's rural co-ops and municipal utilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would also benefit families who want to invest in renewable energy. It would extend the credit for residential solar property for 6 years and increase the annual credit cap, currently capped at $2,000, to $4,000. And it would expand the definition to include residential small wind equipment and geothermal heat pumps so that consumers have more options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rising gas prices are forcing many Coloradans to dip into their savings just to make ends meet. This bill will help families reduce their fuel bills by providing $3000 in tax credits toward the purchase of fuel-efficient, plug-in hybrid vehicles. It will also help address long-term fuel cost concerns by expanding production of homegrown fuels, including creating a new production tax credit for cellulosic biofuels besides ethanol, as well as an extension of the tax credits for biodiesel and renewable  diesel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported the energy bill that the House passed last year which included many of these important tax provisions, as well as the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008 that the House passed earlier this year. But, for the lack of support in the Senate, these provisions have not yet made it to the President's desk to be signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this bill will also help Colorado businesses stay competitive by extending the research and development tax credit for 1 year. While again I would like to see this key tax credit extended for more than 1 year, this is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help with the hard economic times that Coloradans are facing, this bill includes several other key tax credits, including expanding the child tax credit for some of our neediest families, allowing teachers to take a deduction for purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pockets, and providing additional support for families paying for college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope today we can move this bill forward and promote positive change that will benefit our families and rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage my colleagues in the House to vote for this needed legislation, and also encourage quick action in the Senate so that we may move it to the President's desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. I would like to thank my colleague the Chairman of Ways and Means, Congressman Charles Rangel for bringing this energy legislation forward .</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill extends dozens of expired or expiring tax provisions, and extends and creates new energy-related tax incentives for the production of wind and other renewable energy and for homeowners' investment in solar and fuel cell equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Texas has invested in the production of wind and is looking to come up with more ways to aid us in energy conservation and harnessing our natural resources in a way that does not damage the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an undeniable consensus on the importance of America achieving energy independence in the 21st century. It is critical that we terminate our dependence on foreign sources of oil, the majority of which are located in regions of the world which are unstable and in most circumstances, opposed to our interests. Accordingly, there is no issue more essential to our economic and national security than energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By investing in renewable energy and increasing access to potential sources of energy, I believe we can be partners with responsible members of America's energy producing community in our collective goal of reaching energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Houston, Texas, is the energy capital of the world, for the past 12 years I have been the Chair of the Energy Braintrust of the Congressional Black Caucus. During this time, I have hosted a variety of Energy Braintrusts designed to bring in all of the relevant players ranging from environmentalists to producers of energy from a variety of sectors including coal, electric, natural gas, nuclear, oil, and alternative energy sources as well as energy producers from West Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My Energy Braintrusts were designed to be a call of action to all of the sectors that comprise the American and international energy industry, to the African American community, and to the nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy is the lifeblood of every economy, especially ours. Producing more of it leads to more good jobs, cheaper goods, lower fuel prices, and greater economic and national security. Bringing together thoughtful yet distinct voices to engage each other on the issue of energy independence has resulted in the beginning of a transformative dialectic which can ultimately result in reforming our energy industry to the extent that we as a nation achieve energy security and energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I represent the city of Houston, the energy capital of the world, I realize that many oil and gas companies provide many jobs for many of my constituents and serve a valuable need. The energy industry in Houston exemplifies the stakeholders who must be instrumental in devising a pragmatic strategy for resolving our national energy crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation will aid Americans as we seek to wean ourselves from our foreign oil dependence. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this common sense piece of legislation offered by my dear friend, Representative Charlie Rangel, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. If enacted, his bill will marshal the tremendous economic power of our Nation's physical and human capital and direct it towards solving the twin challenges of energy dependence and global warming. Through $20 billion investment in renewable energy tax incentives, carbon mitigation provisions,  transportation efficiency tax credits, and energy efficiency incentives, this bill offers a comprehensive strategy that empowers both individual citizens and the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill empowers everyday Americans by providing tax credits to green citizens who add energy-efficient improvements to their homes and businesses and purchase plug-in electric cars. The bill helps the private sector push the limits of research and development by encouraging the building of carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects. The bill also creates incentives for the energy production sector to invest in nontraditional cutting edge energy production methods. I am particularly  excited that this bill will, for the first time, incentivize investment in technologies that will harness the power of the waves and tides found in our Nation's Great Lakes and oceans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also proud of this body's recent efforts to address the global climate change crisis. This bill is a logical and important next step toward this end. For too long, our country lagged behind the rest of the industrialized world in recognizing and taking action to address the climate change crisis. Global warming endangers all of us, but threatens to have the most devastating impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable. By encouraging our Nation's citizens and businesses to act in a carbon-conscious  way, we protect not only ourselves, but show compassion for our brothers and sisters around the world. At a time when global public opinion regarding our Nation is at an all-time low, the important positive impact this bill will have on our country's public diplomacy efforts should not be downplayed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I believe that this bill serves as a powerful example of the tax policy differences between the 110th Congress and past Congresses. Instead of using the tax code to promote inequality and corporate largess, the American people now know that the tax code can be used to promote personal responsibility, national security, compassion, and global sustainability. I am proud to join with my colleagues here today as we continue to establish a progressive tax policy for the 21st century.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. This bill provides tax relief for millions of Americans while spurring business investment and innovation in renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to note that <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> will benefit the families of millions of children by expanding the child tax credit to those earning $8,500 a year. This bill will also provide tax relief by extending the State and local sales tax deduction, provide property tax relief for 30 million homeowners, and help families afford college with the tuition deduction. As the only former school superintendent serving in Congress, I am especially pleased to note that this bill is supported by the National  Education Association because it includes an extension of the tax deduction for educators who help supply their classrooms, and an extension of the Quality Zone Academy Bonds school modernization program that helps school districts address renovation and repair needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> includes important tax relief provisions for businesses as well as individuals  and families. This bill extends the Research and Development Tax Credit for over 27,000 businesses, the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for leasehold improvements and qualified restaurant improvements, and the tax credit for the environmental remediation of brownfields areas. We need to strengthen our economy by helping to spur American innovation with investment  in American businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing alternative energy sources and ending our dependence on foreign oil is one of the most critical challenges facing our nation. <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> includes several provisions that will spur innovation in this area such as an extension of investment and production tax credits for solar energy, wind energy, and energy derived from biomass, geothermal, hydropower, and solid waste. In addition, <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> includes incentives that promote the production of homegrown renewable fuels, like biodiesel,  for the installation of more E-85 pumps, and a $3,000 tax credit for the purchase of fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid vehicles. These provisions will create and preserve thousands of "green collar jobs" as well as provide relief for Americans who continue to see gas prices rise to historic records across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the passage of <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for nearly eight years, this Administration's backwards energy policy has lined the pockets of oil company executives while hurting American consumers, the economy, and the planet. This bill encourages production of clean alternative fuels and renewable energy while creating jobs. It transfers Oil Executive Power to Blue Collar Renewable Power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week the House passed legislation on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to give hurting Americans an immediate break at the pump. But the energy crisis demands long term action, breaking our addiction to oil and transitioning our economy to clean renewable energy sources once and for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week immediate relief with SPR, this week we put our nation on a path to a clean renewable future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush and Senate Republicans have been given opportunity after opportunity to pass tax credit extensions for renewable energy. They have sided with Big Oil each time, even as oil prices have blown past $100 a barrel and many Americans are now paying $4 per gallon for gas. This morning oil reached $130 a barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill finds alternative revenue raisers which I do support. But let's not forget what this Administration fought to protect. ExxonMobil had $40 billion in profit last year. Do you know how the largest corporate profit in history was used in 2007?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It repurchased $31.8 billion worth of stock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It increased compensation for top executives by 170 percent since 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It financed a $100 million public relations campaign to try to deflect blame from angry consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It invested around $10 million in renewable energy alternatives. That is less than one tenth of one percent of their profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These and other findings are being released today in a report by the Select Committee that analyzes where Big Oil's profits are going. Let's hope President Bush's love for the oil industry doesn't extend to hedge fund managers and corporate CEOs using offshore tax havens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, because of this Administration's misguided policies, the renewable energy industry has its back against the wall. Solar and wind companies are delaying projects because of investment uncertainty. There is no more time to delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other side likes to tell America that wind and solar and biomass cannot be real solutions to our energy challenge. They tell us that drilling in our most pristine natural areas and building nuclear power plants with taxpayer support are the only things that can solve this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. Last year the United States installed 5,244 megawatts of wind power, 30 percent of all the new capacity installed nationwide in 2007. Solar photovoltaic installations in the U.S. also grew an incredible 80 percent. This was the start of the renewable energy revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Department of Energy produced a study detailing what it would take for America to meet 20 percent of its electricity needs with wind power in 2030. The way the industry has grown over the last decade--about 30 percent a year--we can meet this target ahead of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also provides valuable incentives for carbon capture and sequestration, plug-in hybrid cars, and renewable fuels. The American entrepreneur will rise to the energy and climate challenge if Congress puts the right incentives in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> will give renewable energy the support it needs, drive economic expansion and job growth in this country and put America on a greener path towards realizing long-term solutions to global warming. I urge an "aye" vote on the rule and on the underlying bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. As a member of the Ways &amp; Means Committee, I am proud to have helped craft this very important tax bill that will give much needed relief to millions of American taxpayers while also moving forward on our agenda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, over the last several years we have seen tax bills pushed through Congress and signed by the President under the guise of "relief' for the middle class and the poorest in the country. I think many in this chamber have now come to recognize that many of these measures presented as tax relief for the middle class were in fact more tax breaks for the richest in society. Today we finally have before us a bill that will give real relief to millions of taxpayers, many of whom are hardworking  middle class families struggling with rising energy and food bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> addresses the need for more clean energy production in our country by providing long-term extensions of the renewable energy production tax credit and the solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credit, while amending them to increase accessibility. These long-term extensions will give utilities and investors the predictability they need to move forward with new generation projects in the years to come. The bill also addresses energy use and carbon emissions by extending multiple  energy-efficient credits for homes and businesses, creating incentives for carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects, and calling for carbon audit of the tax code to determine what policies are encouraging wasteful energy use and unnecessary carbon emissions. The Act also addresses our dependence on dirty foreign oil by extending and improving tax credits for the production of cellulosic biofuels and plug-in electric vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most exciting of all, however, are the innovative qualified energy conservation bonds this bill creates. The qualified energy conservation bonds give states and local governments the resources needed to invest in green programs designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Giving local authorities the power to choose what green energies to implement in their backyard is good public policy, because I know the energy needs of western Wisconsin are vastly different than those of Queens. By not picking  the winners and losers in Washington, we are allowing exciting technological changes, advancements, and the market--not Congress--drive the green energy revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the area of tax relief, <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> extends several popular expiring tax provisions. In particular, the bill will provide property tax relief for 30 million Americans, help for more than 12 million children through an expanded child tax credit, tax relief for more than 11 million families through state and local sales tax deduction, help for more than 4.5 million families to cover the cost of education through the tuition deduction, and relief for more than 3.5 million teachers who will be reimbursed  for out-of-pocket expenses for their classrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill is fully offset and complies with pay-go rules. Under the leadership of Chairman RANGEL and Speaker PELOSI, we are demonstrating that we can provide tax relief without sending the debt on to our children. After years of fiscal recklessness--deficit-financed tax cuts for the wealthy and out-of-control government spending--this bill sets a precedent of fiscally responsible tax reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, .Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this sensible and fair tax bill before us today. Offering some tax relief in uncertain economic times and meeting the challenge of climate change with innovative and constructive solutions are exactly the issues this Congress should be focused on. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400259" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act and congratulate Speaker PELOSI and Chairman RANGEL for putting forward legislation that will make a real difference for American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> extends and expands tax incentives for renewable energy and encourages energy efficiency. At a time when families are facing record-breaking gas prices, this bill will help to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower energy bills. These tax incentives will also create and preserve good-paying "green collar" jobs such as those in the wind and solar industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act also furthers our nation's innovation efforts by extending the research and development tax credit for 27,000 companies. It is critical for our global competitiveness that we encourage and support entrepeneurs and new ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For families struggling to make ends meet in this difficult economy, this bill provides 30 million homeowners with property tax relief, expands the child tax credit, and extends the state and local sales tax deduction. It also helps students afford higher education with a tuition deduction and provides our teachers a tax deduction for classroom expenses. Finally,  this legislation provides additional tax relief under the Earned Income Tax Credit for 22,000  troops in combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to ensure that our children and grandchildren are not burdened with additional debt, this bill is fully paid for by closing a tax loophole for offshore companies and delaying a tax break for U.S. multinational companies. These changes not only ensure this bill follows pay-go, they also improve the fairness of our tax code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill> is critical to our long term energy policy and to family budgets. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="CONCLUSION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this past fall, this House passed <bill type="h" number="3997">H.R. 3997</bill>, which included a provision to permanently extend the military eligibility for the earned income tax credit (EITC). However, we are back here again while our men and women in uniform still wait for a permanent solution. We provided a 1-year extension, but our military deserve a permanent fix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without action today, hundreds of thousands of troops could find their EITC eligibility slashed. It would be a tax borne solely by our soldiers and our military families. We call it a soldier tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military continues to serve our country with honor and distinction. The last thing we need is for our soldiers and their families to have to worry about paying higher taxes next year. That is why I authored the Tax Relief for Armed Combat Families Act for 2007. It will permanently end the soldier tax. Our military families should not have to worry from year to year what funds are going to be available to take care of their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman RANGEL for working my language into today's legislation, and I call on my colleagues to pass this important legislation. Let's permanently end the soldier tax.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE V--TAX ADMINISTRATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward motion that offers Members of this House a simple choice. Are you in favor of long-term extensions of these expiring tax provisions and extending the all-important AMT patch, without raising taxes?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have discussed at length here today, the majority's bill unwisely adheres to their ill-advised PAYGO rules. Thus, they have once again found themselves boxed in a corner, scouring the Tax Code for ways to fuel their agenda. Whether that agenda involves additional spending, new tax incentives, or even just extensions of the low-tax policies that Republicans originally enacted during our time in the majority, the Democrat solution seems to always be the same: tax, tax, tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill is no different. While there is virtually no disagreement in this House that the expiring tax reductions contained in the underlying legislation need to be renewed, the two parties seem to have a major disagreement about whether revenue-raisers should be necessary to pay for them. The majority's bill represents a clear choice in favor of higher taxes. Our motion to recommit, on the other hand, represents a clear choice in favor of extending current tax relief, without offsetting  tax increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the bill brought forward today by the majority, Mr. Speaker, which contains $55.5 billion in revenue-raisers, our motion contains no--repeat, no--tax increases. Democrats were wrong to propose these sorts of offsetting tax hikes last year, and they're wrong again today. If they stick with their misguided PAYGO rules, they'll be wrong again in 2010 as well, when a huge number of critically important tax policies, ranging from the expanded $1,000 child credit to the lower rates on dividends  and capital gains and lower individual rates will expire. And the majority's PAYGO logic will then require more than a $3.5 trillion tax increase simply to maintain current law. But that's where PAYGO will take us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion to recommit offers us a different path, Mr. Speaker. Not only does our motion reject the majority's tax hikes, it extends the bill's positive provisions for considerably longer than the underlying bill does. Indeed, our motion extends the package of expiring provisions, including all the expiring energy tax provisions, through 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if you support the deduction for State and local sales taxes, here's your chance to extend it for 6 years, not just 1. If you support the research and development tax credit, here's your chance to extend it for 6 years, not just 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, if you want to extend all of the important low-tax policies that expired last year--as well as the energy extenders that are set to expire just months from now--on a long-term basis, here's your chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This motion also gives Members the opportunity to extend one final crucial provision that has gone completely unaddressed by the majority: the AMT patch. As we've highlighted throughout today's debate, the majority's legislation is deafeningly silent on the urgently needed AMT patch. Their bill's failure to patch the AMT for 2008 means that more than 25 million middle class individuals and families are in line for a $61.5 billion tax hike next April, an average tax increase for those families  of more than $2,400 per taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our motion does what everyone knows must be done. It patches the AMT for 2008, and it does so early in the year to help ensure that we avoid a repeat performance of the legislative meltdown engineered by the majority last year, which prevented the 2007 patch from being enacted until the day after Christmas. We need to patch the AMT and we need to patch it now. This motion gives us that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will close, Mr. Speaker, with just a word about process. I suspect that we'll hear from our friends on the other side that this motion will kill the bill. Well, Mr. Speaker, I would submit to you that you can't kill a bill that's already dead. This bill is dead on arrival in the other body, Mr. Speaker. Forty-one Senators signed a letter last month pledging to oppose tax bills that contain revenue-raising offsets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the very same day that our committee, the Ways and Means Committee, reported out this bill last week, our colleagues across the Capitol passed a motion on the Senate floor instructing Senate conferees on the budget resolution to reject the House's plan to raise $110 billion in taxes in order to pay for the extension of expiring provisions, including the AMT patch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, even if this legislation somehow got through the Senate, the President has indicated he would veto the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can't kill a bill that's already dead, Mr. Speaker. So let's use this motion to recommit to revive this bill, send it back to committee so that we can do our work in a bipartisan way, and get a bill passed and to the President that he will sign.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="TITLE V--TAX ADMINISTRATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in outrageous opposition to the motion to recommit that has been offered to this House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="TITLE V--TAX ADMINISTRATION">
    <paragraph>One, the outrage concerns my love for the Congress and the Constitution. And to think that this great House and the committee which I'm proud to chair would even have to consider what they're thinking, if they're thinking at all on the other side, to decide what we're going to legislate outrages me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Two, whatever the President says he's going to do or may do--we understand that he's addicted to veto, but that shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And why do I think basically it's the right thing? Well, it has to be if you want to extend it for 5 years. So your vote on this, after the motion to recommit dies on this floor, is going to be very interesting as to if you want it for 5, why wouldn't you want to extend it at least for 1?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I wish that I had some time to share with my friend, whom I've enjoyed working with as the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, to ask him how much money do you think they have in Japan and China to loan us? There must be some limit to their capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill costs about $125 billion altogether, I think. $54 billion for the energy provisions as well as for this. So I assume that you want to add another $200 billion to that. And I don't remember you using the creative language that you used when you and the Senate--that you and the other body, whatever they call themselves--decided that you don't have to pay for the alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, if I understood that, I'll take it home to my wife and explain that there are ways that you can lose revenue and not renew it and still not change your lifestyle. And if it works at home, I will come here, and at least for the next Congress, ask Mr. McCrery, if he can't stay over there, come on our side and explain how, if the President puts in the budget that we should be expecting money from these 25 million hostages that shouldn't have to pay the tax, that we don't have  to make up for the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I assume that you have now extended this to cover the extenders. And I hope really that you would stick around a little while so that you will be able to work with me and the next President, not to explain why in the last 8 years we haven't reformed this doggone tax system. Most of this stuff shouldn't be in the Tax Code. You know it and I know it. And the things that should be in the Tax Code should be made permanent. The stuff that shouldn't be in there should be taken out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in 8 years, the President is now talking about vetoing. Why didn't he take enough time to say, Let's straighten out the code, let's attempt to balance the budget, let's do the right thing for energy and whatever has to be in an extender that expires, help us to get rid of it without being charged with raising taxes. Any extender that expires, we would say that it raises taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know and Secretary Paulson knows, and we'll be hearing more from him probably after he leaves the administration, that this House has the responsibility of having a Tax Code that is simple, that is economically inspiring, and is something that can be confident and things shouldn't expire. If they expire, they shouldn't be in there in the first place. If it is good, it should stay in the Tax Code so there's reliability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if you're going to say that we're not going to get revenues as a result of extending this, we say for 1 year, we will raise the money, we will do it the right way, we will be proud of it, and in a small way attempt to stop this deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But be kind to the people in Japan. Be kind to the people in China. They can't forever support everything that the Republicans want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to have to make sacrifices if we want to make changes. So this war is one against ignorance and not having the research and development. It's one in trying to have research and development for our corporations, but, more importantly, to find alternatives to this addiction that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you have been there for 8 years. Please don't try to change the things in 10 minutes here. Join with us. Let's work together in a bipartisan way, and let's mark down this day that is a day that House Democrats and Republicans said, stop the addiction, move to the alternatives, and dedicate ourselves to having a reformed Tax Code, if not this year then certainly next year.</paragraph>
