    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, the Miami Herald's Broward County edition will publish the 1,130th column by writer Claire Mitchel. Claire's column, entitled "The Third Third," is believed to be the longest-running, uninterrupted features column on aging in any major newspaper in America. Nothing in the last 22 years, not illness, surgery, births, deaths, computer foul-ups, vacations, hurricanes, nothing stopped Claire Mitchel from offering her unique weekly perspective on  the aging of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Week after week, Claire's column has offered us wisdom, guidance, insight and gentle chuckles. Her book, a collection of her columns, was entitled "Seeing the World Through Rose-Colored Bifocals." Tony-winning playwright Vinnette Carroll conceived a musical based on Claire's line, "At our age, we don't buy green bananas."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Claire Mitchel has been far more than a columnist. She has been a public relations person who represented everyone from Ann Landers to Eleanor Roosevelt. She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; she had her own radio show; and she was an ardent feminist before mainstream America understood what that meant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Claire was Coordinator of Women's Concerns for Broward County's Human Relations Division for 10 years and a co-founder of the Older Women's League. She was chosen Feminist of the Year by the Broward Commission on the Status of Women and was inducted into the Broward County Women's Hall of Fame. And through it all, she has been a devoted wife and mother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her column, marking her 85th birthday recently, Claire offered this observation: "Today I am a woman of 85, asking the same question everyone asks following such a statement, where did the years go? My answer is, with a lot of living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Each day, on each occasion, when there was a question of whether to do something, I chose yes. No regrets for what I did, just what I didn't do. When others hesitated, I volunteered. Mostly it was the right decision, leading me to an activity that I enjoyed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been the underlying message, Mr. Speaker, of each of Claire Mitchel's weekly writings for the last 22 years: keep living every day to its fullest, no matter what age you are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I pay tribute to Claire Mitchel, whose shoulders are strong enough to have supported thousands of women by sharing with them her pearls of wisdom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in recognition of National Women's History Month as we wind down to the last day of this month on Saturday, March 31. First let me start off by saying how honored I am to be a part of the 110th Congress, which boasts 90 women Members serving in both the House and Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this year's theme of "Generations of Women Moving History Forward," it is my honor to recognize some very special women in my district, the 20th Congressional District of Florida, who have done and continue to do their part to advance the women's movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I call specific attention to a particular group of women who volunteer their time at the Jack and Jill Children's Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Jack and Jill Children's Center is a nonprofit organization that provides family-oriented, early childhood education and support to strengthen working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The center has a volunteer Grandparent Program, whose mission is to engage older adults in volunteer services to meet critical community needs and to enrich the lives of volunteers. Jack and Jill's grandparents have the important job of interacting with little children. Whether it is tying shoes, serving meals, patting backs at nap time, or sitting with a child and practicing writing their name, these grandparents provide each child with a special relationship that he or she may not otherwise  receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the Grandparent Program, Mr. Speaker, is attributed to its mutually beneficial nature, to both the participants and children who receive the care. Many of the programs' grandparents are working with their own grandchildren, who will grow up in a loving educational environment, fostering a stronger sense of community, work ethic and successful life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These amazing women, Mr. Speaker, are Martha Myrick, Pearline Scott, Annie Welch, Merceline Victor, Barbara Osgood, Elizabeth Dorsey, Johnnie Daniels, Maria Morency, Margaret Lewis, and Albertha Brown. They collectively average 75 years of age and have been an active part of our south Florida community all of their lives, some of whom even attended grade school together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing a better life for our Nation's working, single and low-income mothers, Jack and Jill's Grandparent Program is moving women's history forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our Speaker, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy Pelosi, exemplifies that a woman can do a job that any man can. I thank her for her service to our Nation, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell America about some of the women in my district who make positive changes in the lives of others.</paragraph>
