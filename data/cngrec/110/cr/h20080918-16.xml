    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, by a 5-to-1 ratio, Americans believe the media are trying to help Senator Obama win the Presidency. The following partial list of the "Best of the Worst" examples of media bias shows why Americans are right to be concerned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One, Senator Obama has led Senator McCain in news coverage for 12 consecutive weeks, according to the Nonpartisan Project For Excellence in Journalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two, journalists who gave money to Senator Obama outnumber those who contributed to Senator McCain by a 20-1 margin, according to Investors Business Daily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three, while the media often label Governor Palin "conservative," they rarely call Senator Obama or Senator Biden "liberal," even though the National Journal ranked Senator Obama as the most liberal Member of the Senate and Senator Biden as the third most liberal Member of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four, the New York Times opinion editor, a former staff member in the Clinton administration, refused to publish an op-ed by Senator McCain about the Iraq war, just days after publishing an op-ed on the same subject by Senator Obama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five, although the media criticize Senator McCain for running negative TV ads, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Advertising Project found that 77 percent of Senator Obama's recent ads have been negative, far more than Senator McCain's.</paragraph>
