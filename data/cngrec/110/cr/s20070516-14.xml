    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today, on National Police Week, to honor this Nation's law enforcement officers. Our law enforcement officers are some of the bravest men and women we will ever come across. They selflessly dedicate their lives to keeping our communities safe and taking dangerous individuals off our streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, some of those officers lose their lives while on duty. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial currently bears the names of more than 17,500 officers who have been killed or died while on duty. This week, 382 additional names will be added. Two of those fallen officers are from my home State of Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jackie Ryden dedicated his life to law enforcement, spending 33 years with the Ellsworth Police Department, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, and the Prescott Police Department. He was a well-liked and well-respected member of the police force, as well as his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 2, 2006, Jackie responded to a natural gas explosion and the resulting fire. He helped to evacuate a number of local citizens from their homes. Shortly after Officer Ryden returned to his patrol car to help direct traffic, he suffered a heart attack and died. According to those who knew him best, he passed away doing what he loved best--serving and protecting his community. Jackie Ryden is survived by his wife, two children, and three grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second officer whom I seek to honor today is Stephen Hahn. Stephen was a special deputy with the Eau Claire County Sheriff's Office, serving approximately 40 years in law enforcement. Mr. Hahn was killed in a traffic accident while transporting an inmate. A vehicle heading in the opposite direction lost control and struck the van being driven by Deputy Hahn. He is survived by his wife and two children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We mourn the loss of these two great, brave men and attempt to honor them by recognizing the sacrifices they made for the benefit of others. Both of their communities, and the State of Wisconsin as a whole, are worse off because of the loss of these two public safety officers. I am pleased, however, that their names are being added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, so they can forever be remembered for their hard work and dedication to improving the lives of those around them.</paragraph>
