  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400266" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson took the field as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team and broke the color barrier as the first African American to play in the major leagues. His courage, determination and integrity have served as an inspiration to generations, and opened the door to thousands to play our national pastime. Rightly, our Nation stopped recently to celebrate the 60th anniversary of this historic milestone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as many of us know, the practice of discrimination and racism continued for many years, unfortunately, even after Mr. Robinson's historic first game. Indeed, there were other courageous individuals who joined in the fight for equality and justice for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One such man was W. Horace Carter of Tabor City, North Carolina. On a July night in 1950, thick with the heat and humidity of the deep south, Horace Carter watched as Ku Klux Klansmen made their violent way through his hometown of Tabor City, North Carolina. One hundred Klansmen in 29 cars robbed and terrorized this small community of farmers and merchants with threats and racism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although just 29 years old at the time and the new publisher, editor and newsman for the Tabor City Tribune, Mr. Carter knew this was his moment of decision. He wrote, "I searched my soul that evening and on into the next week. Was it worth sacrificing our happiness, shattering the tranquil life of running a little newspaper in a small town, taking part in Red Cross drives, church covered-dish suppers and annual yam festival promotion, just because I believed in a principle? Was it worth the  risk that the print shop might be burned, our home dynamited? I could be dragged from our house with the frantic screams of my family ringing in my ears. I might suffer a brutal lashing by a band of masked hoodlums or even death if I dared to oppose them. Is it the time to stand up for principles, even before I am fully aware of what this Klan proposes," he wrote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I didn't want to sound pious or self-righteous," he said, "but I reasoned that if I were ever to campaign against this Klan reorganization, I should do it from its inception. That was now. I sat down at my used $15 Royal typewriter with my experienced hunt-and-peck typing skill and I wrote an editorial."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus began a 3-year crusade Horace Carter took against the Klan in the editorial pages of this small, southeastern North Carolina newspaper. Mr. Carter's courage, determination and words helped in the convictions and prison time for Ku Klux Klansmen. From his doing the right thing, Mr. Carter catapulted the Tabor City Tribune into national prominence, which received the Pulitzer Prize for Meritorious Community Service, the most prestigious of the Pulitzers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Jackie Robinson once said, "A life is not important except in the impact it has on others' lives."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Carter's life has continued to be one of honor, leadership and service. And although Mr. Robinson didn't  know W. Horace Carter, there is no doubt that his words were about persons just like him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Carter was elected mayor of Tabor City in 1954 and was a judge in the weekly city court. He served as president of the Tabor City Chamber of Commerce, the Tabor City Rotary Club, the Columbus County Economic Development Commission, the County Library Board, Tabor Industrial Development, Inc., Tabor City Recreation Commission and a Sunday school teacher in the Baptist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a World War II Navy veteran, Mr. Carter and his wife Lucille have three children: Rusty Carter, Linda Carter Metzger and Velda Carter Hughes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God's blessings continue to shine upon this most special man and his enduring legacy, a man who stood for equality, a man who stood for justice.</paragraph>
