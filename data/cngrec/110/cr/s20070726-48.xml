  <narrative>200TH ANNIVERSARY OF NELSON COUNTY, VIRGINIA -- (Senate - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10147">S10147</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize a county in the Commonwealth of Virginia that is celebrating its bicentennial anniversary. Throughout this year, Nelson County residents will gather to celebrate their county's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nelson County is nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, midway between Charlottesville and Lynchburg. It was settled by colonists of English and German descent, as well as by the Scotch-Irish, whom I proudly recognize as my ancestors. The county was officially founded in 1807 and named in honor of Thomas Nelson, Jr., third Governor of Virginia. Nelson County is now home to about 14,500 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who call Nelson County home, it is a comfortable place to work and live. Nelson County is also a community in the truest sense of the word. This was most clearly demonstrated when neighbors came together and offered comfort and helping hands after Hurricane Camille caused widespread destruction in the county in 1969. Today community members can look to each other and remember with pride how they came together under hard circumstances to make Nelson County prosper once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nelson County's economy is based on agriculture and natural resource-based industries such as timber and quarrying. The scenic surroundings have also attracted recreational development in recent years, making the county an outdoor enthusiast's haven. Outdoor recreation opportunities include hiking along the magnificent Appalachian Trail or to the top of Crabtree Falls, the highest cascading waterfall east of the Mississippi River, as well as canoeing and fishing on the James or Tye Rivers and  skiing at Wintergreen Resort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans may not be familiar with Nelson County by name, but millions have had a glimpse of what life was like in this rural community due to the writings of Nelson County native, Earl Hamner, Jr. During the Great Depression, Hamner began writing of his experience growing up in Nelson County. These writings eventually provided the substance for "The Waltons" television series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nelson County Museum of History, which is currently being developed, will soon offer visitors opportunities to learn the rich heritage and rural culture of Nelson County through events, exhibits, and educational programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rural community of Nelson County has much to remember and much to be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Nelson County and its residents on their first 200 years and in wishing them well in the future.</paragraph>
