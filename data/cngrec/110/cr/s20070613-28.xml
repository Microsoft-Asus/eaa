    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize and congratulate students Natalie Haworth and Trenton Knight from Dill City High School in Burns Flat, OK, and Libby Trusty from Verdigris High School in Claremore, OK. These students have been selected to present their award winning National History Day projects in Washington, DC, today. Each project reflects on this year's National History Day theme, "Triumphs and Tragedies in History."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Haworth and Knight have been selected to present their history project at the White House Visitor's Center. Trusty has been selected to present her project at the National Archives and Records Administration. Their projects were selected by the National History Day program from hundreds of thousands nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Haworth's and Knight's project, "Land Divided--World United," is a depiction of the historical creation of the Panama Canal. The exhibit begins with the original vision to construct a channel through Central America and extends all the way to the completion and proposed expansion of the Panama Canal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trusty is presenting a U.S. Supreme Court case which addressed the controversial issue of equal educational opportunities available throughout American history. Fisher v. University of Oklahoma Board of Regents was one of the unfamiliar but significant cases that ultimately led to the landmark decision to desegregate schools in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is important for students to be informed and educated about the milestones of American history, because it will strengthen them as our country's future leaders and provide them with the knowledge to continue to lead our Nation as our Founding Fathers intended. History is an integral part of the education of future generations of Americans, and I would like to commend the National History Day program for empowering teachers to improve history education and influencing students to  follow these Oklahoma students' exemplary example.</paragraph>
