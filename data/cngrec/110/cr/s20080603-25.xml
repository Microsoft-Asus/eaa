    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the life of a great Arkansan, William E. "Bill" Clark, who passed on May 15, 2007. Bill was respected as a great philanthropist, sportsman, business leader and citizen of Arkansas. He was seen as an unparalleled advocate for the needs and welfare of his State and its citizens. He dedicated his life to serving his community and supporting individual lives in the public and private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill graduated from Little Rock Central High School in 1961 and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 1965 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Thereafter, he joined his brothers at C&amp;C Electric Construction Company in Little Rock, working there until 1981 when he acquired Bragg's Electric Construction Company. In 1987, Bill partnered with Dillard's Incorporated and founded CDI Contractors, which grew to be one of the largest construction firms in the South. High-profile  projects completed by CDI under Bill's leadership include the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, the headquarters for Heifer International in Little Rock and Immanuel Baptist Church in West Little Rock, of which Bill was a devout attendee for over 27 years. Bill's impact on the business community of Arkansas is evident by the numerous business and professional awards</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Respected and admired throughout Arkansas for over three decades, Bill took on countless worthwhile projects with optimism and enthusiasm; he was an inspiration to many. The positions he held relating to public service are evidence of his commitment to his community. His awards reflect his professional successes as well as his avid public service. These awards included the Arkansas Arts Center's Winthrop Rockefeller Memorial Award, the Boys and Girls Club of America National Service to the Youth  Award, the Edwin N. Hanlon Memorial Award for Contribution to the Arts, and the Arkansas Children's Award from the Arkansas Sheriff's Youth Ranches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill was a past president of the board for the University of Arkansas board of trustees, the Arkansas Arts Center, the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce and the Country Club of Little Rock. Bill served as a board member of the Little Rock Boys and Girls Club, the Arkansas Arts Center Foundation, Baptist Health, the UAMS Foundation, Ouachita Baptist University Business Advisory Council, and the Episcopal Collegiate School Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his lifetime, Bill was an enthusiastic outdoorsman. He loved hunting, fishing, and golf, while remaining committed to conservation endeavors. A final gesture honoring Bill and benefiting his community is the establishment of the William E. "Bill" Clark Presidential Park Wetlands, a 13-acre tract located on the banks of the Arkansas River running adjacent to the Clinton Presidential Library. This natural wetland area provides an educational exhibit that can be enjoyed by State, national,  and international visitors for generations to come. As contractor for the Clinton Presidential Library, Bill believed in the library's mission to strive for educational advances within Arkansas, including the history of the United States, the institutional roles of the Presidency and the American political system as applied to President William J. Clinton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard for people to experience Arkansas without noticing the remarkable accomplishments of Bill Clark. It is not hard to imagine just what makes Bill Clark so special to his family, his friends, and to Arkansas. He was a person of great faith, a loving husband and father, a doting grandfather, and a humorous, compassionate friend to all he met. Bill never approached a situation with a negative attitude; rather, he saw everything as an opportunity to benefit his community. Bill will be well  remembered for his generosity and commitment to improving his community.</paragraph>
