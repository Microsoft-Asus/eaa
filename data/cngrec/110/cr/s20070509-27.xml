    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize a small business from my home State that has triumphed over adversity in the wake of several major coastal storms. The Inn at Long Sands in York Beach, ME, suffered extensive damage as the result of a devastating storm on Mother's Day weekend of May 2006. With Memorial Day weekend approaching, signaling the unofficial beginning of summer--a busy time for York County's tourism industry--Arline Shea, the Inn's co-owner watched countless  hotel and meal reservations get washed away. As a result of the storm, the Inn sustained over $100,000 in damage. This was not a welcome beginning for Arline, who had just purchased the Inn in February 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the storm dealt Arline a heavy blow, she exemplified Maine's entrepreneurial spirit by reopening in a matter of weeks. To recover from the damage the Inn had sustained, Arline wisely made good use of the tools available to small businesses in the wake of disasters. She contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration to find out what kinds of assistance she would be able to receive. Arline's exemplary decision to find out what help was available  to her, along with her hard work and dedication, allowed her to reopen the Inn and Long Sands in time for last year's Fourth of July holiday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite all of the tragedy that befell Arline Shea and her employees, her optimistic spirit shined through just a month following the storm, when the Portsmouth Herald interviewed her for a story on the recovery from the storm. "Nobody died," Arline said. "We all have our health. That and the ice cream cone I have every day from the Village Scoop helps," she added with good humor. Arline displayed an entrepreneurial spirit, combined with a sense of humor, that allowed her to prevail following  the devastation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the nightmare did not stop there for Arline. Just last month, Maine suffered, as did most of the east coast, a crippling storm, known to Mainers as the "Patriots Day Storm." This time, however, Arline was prepared for the storm, with sandbags and new sump pumps. Because of the lessons learned--and her preparation--Arline sustained minimal damage from  a storm that caused major flooding in most parts of the country, and certainly across  Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While countless Maine businesses have overcome obstacles and succeeded, Arline's story sticks out as an outstanding example to all Maine business owners. Shortly after purchasing the Inn, Arline's father passed away. She rebounded from this personal tragedy, and from the disaster that beset her business, by utilizing the resources available to her, maintaining an optimistic spirit, and learning how to deal with disaster in the process. Arline's inspiring example shows all Maine business owners  that they can persevere from any challenge that they face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, I want to congratulate Arline Shea and the Inn at Long Sands for providing small businesses with a beacon to look forward to. She is truly a small business owner of whom we are all so proud. We wish her future success and offer her, and all of Maine's small businesses, our complete assistance. Maine, and indeed the nation, can benefit from Arline Shea's optimism, determination, and entrepreneurship.</paragraph>
