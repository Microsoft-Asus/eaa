    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we need a history lesson right here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Article II, the executive powers shall be vested in the powers of the President of the United States. He shall hold  his office for a term of 4 years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Vice President has a problem of figuring out which branch of government he belongs to. But in Federalist Paper No. 68, Alexander Hamilton was very, very clear about this. The appointment of an extraordinary person as Vice President has been objected to as superfluous. Take the Senator of any State from his seat as a Senator to place him in the President of the Senate would be totally ridiculous, would be to exchange a regard to the State from which he came a constant for a contingent vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other consideration is that as the Vice President may occasionally become a substitute for the President, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons which recommend the mode of elections prescribed for the one apply for the great, if not with equal force, to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable that this, as in most other instances, with the objection which is made, would be against the Constitution of this State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Vice President, go back to the Constitution and learn where you belong.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
