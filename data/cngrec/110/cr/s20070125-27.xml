  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the life and accomplishments of Tom Mooney, the former president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers. Tom graduated from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, OH, then devoted himself to ensuring a quality education for the children of Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his distinguished tenure as an educator and administrator, Tom served in a number of capacities. He started in 1974 as a high school government teacher. Later Tom would serve as president of the Cincinnati Federation of Teachers, as vice president of the American Federation of Teachers and finally as the president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers, a post he held for six years until his passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Mooney was a passionate advocate for teachers and public education. He worked tirelessly. He encouraged parental involvement in the education of their children and vehemently opposed efforts to privatize educational services, as he believed it would be detrimental to the vast majority of Ohio's public school students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom exemplified dedication to--and true advocacy for--children and public education. I am honored to offer this resolution and pay tribute to a great Ohioan and a great American.</paragraph>
