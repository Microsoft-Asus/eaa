    <paragraph>Every day, hardworking moms and dads without health coverage worry about their children getting the care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this President's watch, the number of uninsured children in this country has grown for the first time in years, and what has the President done? Nothing. That's right, nothing. This President has done nothing. Will Republican Members of Congress stand with the President and also do nothing, or will they stand with America's children?
