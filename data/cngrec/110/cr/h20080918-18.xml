    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="6869">H.R. 6869</bill>, the Border Security Search Accountability Act of 2008, which I introduced into the House last week. This bill establishes strict guidelines for Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement's electronic device seizure policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to ensure that Customs and Border agents have the tools necessary to go after potential terrorists. This bill allows for the appropriate search, review, retention and sharing of information on an individual's electronic device, as necessary for security purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6869">H.R. 6869</bill> also ensures that when an individual's property is seized at a point of entry, there is a well-defined procedure in place that will protect their privacy and electronic data, especially the doctor-patient and attorney-client privileges. This legislation also requires the Department of Homeland Security to post information about individual rights related to border searches in visible areas near the search points so that individuals will understand their rights.</paragraph>
