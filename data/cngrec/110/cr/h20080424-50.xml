  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the issues of homeland security and ask my colleagues to reflect upon the legislation, historic legislation that we have just passed regarding the U.S. Coast Guard. We have added enough new Coast Guard to raise the number to 47,000 members of the U.S. Coast Guard. That is something to applaud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have provided an opportunity for securing our LNG, liquid natural gas, in the number of ports around America where surrounding communities exist. We have created a format to secure our waterways where the U.S. Coast Guard is involved. We have provided for an enhanced expedited process for securing what we call TWIC cards. These are documentation for port workers to have after September 25, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise to offer a resolution that will acknowledge the Transportation Security Administration addressing the question of security as relates to our transportation security that would mandate the implementation of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 that enhances security against terrorist attack and other security threats to our Nation's rail and mass transit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am doing this along with a number of Members, including Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON of the full committee. It is important to note that transportation systems are systems that have been under attack, particularly mass transit, and I believe it is important to encourage TSA to continue to developed the National Explosive Detection Canine Team Program which is supported in a bipartisan manner, one that I have seen work and has been very effective to improve the success of the Online Learning  Center by providing increased person-to-person professional development programs to ensure those responsible for securing against terrorist attacks on our transportation systems are highly trained and to continue to serve our Nation's mass transit and rail systems against terrorist attack and other security threats so as to ensure the safety of our commuters on our Nation's mass transit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a resolution to encourage the TSA to improve their work product, to thank them for the work product that they are doing, but also to encourage them to work diligently in compliance with the new legislation that we just passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to speak to the phenomenon that is being used across America called ICE raids. I am very well aware that the Secretary of Homeland Security believes that he has been forced to use a new tactic in immigration reform because this Congress has not been able to shed itself of obstacles of bias and disagreement, to get into a room and truly provide for comprehensive reform of the immigration system, something I have worked on for 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the leadership from both sides of the aisle with their different perspectives. I am delighted to serve on the Judiciary Committee with JOHN CONYERS and ZOE LOFGREN, who have been champions of this reform process, along with BENNIE THOMPSON and LORETTA SANCHEZ on Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we cannot stand by and allow our immigration system to be formed by massive raids on individuals who are here only to work. My fear is that a potential violent act may occur out of fear and apprehension. So I believe it is important for the administration, the White House, to stand up and be counted, to go to the bully pulpit and insist on a comprehensive response to immigration, not the raiding of Shipley's Do-Nuts, so that people in an apartment building are jumping out of apartment building  windows out of fear. You are not going to deport 12 million people. Get a life. It is important to know who everyone is, and I want to make sure that we do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want it to be known that I stand against random ICE raids. I am not against immigration reform in a right way. I am not for illegal immigration. But I will tell you it will not work. It will be deadly and it will be devastating. It is important for employers to hire documented workers and be under the eye of the law, and we should enforce this idea of making sure people are documented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But it's up to the government to get a system that works so that we can  give documentation to individuals who are here simply to work, and we can weed out the terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People who are working at Shipley's Do-Nuts, people who are in hotels and restaurants, who are not taking American jobs, are doing the work that this Nation needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to hire Americans first. But we cannot, by a raid, end the immigration crisis. We need to fix it, and we need to fix it now.</paragraph>
