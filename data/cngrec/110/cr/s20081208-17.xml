  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to talk about our foreign policy. Before doing so, I wish to point out that I have spent the last 2 hours presiding and listening to a number of very strong statements with respect to the automobile bailout and also the proposal that there be some action to limit the next tranche of $300 billion to come on the TARP program. I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota on those issues. We had a pretty hard vote on October 1 with respect to  the TARP program. I was among the overwhelming majority of people in the Senate who voted to go ahead with this program, after the assurances of this administration and the people who had been negotiating on our behalf about the danger that the world economy was in, the prospect of a cataclysmic effect if we did not do something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to look very hard at this next tranche. We should all recall that the program that was voted to go forward was a program that was going to address the situation of toxic assets. The concern that I and many others had about giving one individual the authority in the executive branch to use these funds in a way that did not have a substantial oversight was borne out over what has happened. There is a very high bar that will go forward before I personally would vote in favor of continuing  to allow the Secretary of the Treasury in an outgoing administration to be dispensing these types of funds so close to the approach of a new administration.</paragraph>
