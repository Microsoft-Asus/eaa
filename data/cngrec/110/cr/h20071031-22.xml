    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last November Democrats listened to the American people. But, unfortunately, President Bush continues to ignore them. Democrats promised to take our Nation in a new direction, and in many ways we have. We increased the minimum wage for the first time in a decade. We made Americans safer by fully implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We also restored PAYGO rules so that Congress lives within its means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are proud of our accomplishments, but an intransigent President is blocking our efforts to do more. Lifesaving cures to debilitating diseases remain out of reach because President Bush vetoed stem cell research legislation. Our soldiers continue to referee a civil war in Iraq because President Bush vetoed a bill that would have brought our troops home next year. And millions of children cannot see the doctor of their choice because President Bush vetoed bipartisan legislation that would provide  health insurance to 4 million more kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while it is frustrating to deal with a President who continues to ignore the results of last year's elections, congressional Democrats will continue to move America in a new direction.</paragraph>
