    <paragraph>If there is no further business at this time, and if the distinguished Republican leader has nothing further, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator Specter, the Senate stand adjourned under the previous order.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may, obviously I am not going to object. Let me say to all our colleagues on this side of the aisle, this will be a challenging week. Budget week always is, with numerous votes. Obviously, it would be to the advantage of the body to have a number of those votes before the so-called vote-arama, which occurs as the time expires late in the week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I encourage Republican Senators who have amendments to come on over, beginning tomorrow, lay them down, and let's try to proceed early in the week in order to minimize the inconvenience to everyone at the end of the week.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would only add--and I appreciate very much the Senator's remarks--we have to finish the budget resolution this week. Next week we have to get to the supplemental. We have been told by the Secretary of Defense that all the work on the supplemental must be completed by the end of April. Even though there is a week or so that other arrangements can be made, we have found Secretary Gates to be extremely upfront, and so we have to get to the supplemental next week so we  can complete it by the first of May.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may alert the majority leader, apparently Senator Specter is not coming to the floor tonight, so there is no impediment to the Senate going ahead and adjourning.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:46 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, March 20, 2007, at 10 a.m.</narrative>
