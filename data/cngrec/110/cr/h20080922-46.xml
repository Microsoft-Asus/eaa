    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>September 12 of this year came and went with little mention of the 50th anniversary of one of the most important events of the 20th century. We owe a debt to Congressman Hall for introducing the resolution to remind us of the great importance of Jack Kilby's experiment and for giving us the opportunity to celebrate the positive contributions of the electronics industry to our well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack Kilby knew he was on to something important. He turned down offers from other leading electronics companies to go to Texas Instruments in May 1958, because Texas Instruments was the one company that would let him work full time on miniaturization of electronics. Just 4 months later, he demonstrated what others had been unable to do, that it was possible to create an integrated circuit by combining a transistor, a capacitor and resistors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this happened within a year of the Sputnik, the Russian satellite that was a wake-up call regarding the state of American science and engineering. There were computers then, but they were a mass of vacuum tubes and wires that filled a room but provided very little computing power. Radios, television and communications equipment also existed, but, once again, were fairly complicated devices with limited utility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The miniaturization that Jack Kilby espoused revolutionized electronics. Thanks to the efforts of others, including Bob Noyce and his colleagues at Fairchild, integrated circuits rapidly moved from germanium to widely available silicon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early integrated circuit applications allowed mankind to reach the moon by the end of the 1960s. It completely changed the face of national defense. It allowed Jack Kilby to intent the calculator. It made the Internet possible. It allowed electronics to be the future of automobiles, airplanes, entertainment, medical equipment and manufacturing controls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before Jack Kilby died, the circuits he invented had become microscopic and had decreased in price by a factor of a million. During our lifetimes, they will continue to drop in price, increase in sophistication and be even more integral building blocks for life as we know it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely pleased the leadership of this Committee on Science and Technology has seen fit to push this tribute to such an important set of achievements. I urge my colleagues to join with me in voting for this legislation that honors a group of individuals who truly changed the world for the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1471">H. Res. 1471</bill>, which honors the 50th anniversary of the invention of the integrated circuit by Jack St. Clair Kilby. On September 12, 1958, in a Dallas lab of Texas Instruments, Jack St. Clair Kilby gathered a small group of coworkers to unveil a stunning achievement. Before them sat a thin piece of metal attached to monitoring equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When powered on, it became clear that the single piece of metal was doing the work of several simple electronic components, including transistors, capacitors and resistors. Jack had created the first microchip.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I go back a long ways with Texas Instruments. I knew very well Erik Johnson, who started Texas Instruments. I have talked with him personally on several occasions about TI and how he bought it. He said he bought it on a Saturday morning, and the next morning, Sunday morning, he was driving out to look at what he had bought and turned on his radio, because he had promised his wife he would be back in time to go to church with her. He turned on his radio, and the announcement was that the Japanese  were bombing Pearl Harbor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said to Erik Johnson, Mr. Johnson, as an engineer, you are wonderful, but as a matter of timing, you are perfect, because that launched the world into war and TI has been a major player in the victory that they achieved some 4 or 5 years later. This breakthrough is a similar breakthrough that they have had time and time again at TI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For much of the 20th century, the electronics industry had relied on vacuum tubes as the basis for its design. By 1958, these bulky and fragile devices were beginning to be widely replaced by transistors made of semiconducting metals, which were tougher, which were smaller, which produced less heat. These features allowed electrical engineers to design much more complicated systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as the number of components increased, engineers were having a harder time reliably connecting everything. Cutting edge devices might require connecting thousands of components to thousands of tiny wires by hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack Kilby solved that problem. Over the summer of 1958, Jack created a way to build all of the wires, transistors and other electrical components into a single piece of metal. In essence, electronics manufacturers could take a solid piece of metal and etch a complete, electronic device into it, no assembly required.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This breakthrough, the integrated circuit, revolutionized the world. Jack Kilby's work, as well as fellow integrated circuit pioneers, Geoffrey Drummer and Robert Noyce, heralded the beginning of an encompassing transformation of modern society. Their work paved the way for the modern electronics industry. Electronic devices that once required a small building and teams of engineers working around the clock now fit neatly into pocket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Integrated circuits continue to be a cornerstone of the American economy and an important priority of our research and development institutions. Fifty years after the first demonstration of an integrated circuit, it's fitting that Congress recognizes achievement and the importance of this sector now and in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="1471">H. Res. 1471</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding me some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it's very appropriate that we are heralding this innovation today. I want to tie this into what we have been trying to do here on the House, what Republicans have been trying to do all this year, and that is to allow us to create more American-made energy by drilling in Alaska and drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf and using that money that we, the Federal Government would get, for the leases, to find new and exciting alternatives for our energy situation, the challenges  that we face. I want to highlight again what some newspapers across the country have said about the cynical bill that was passed last week by Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats and show that this is understood all across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New Hampshire Union Leader editorial said, "Drilling for cover: Pelosi &amp; Co.'s phony bill ..... Democrats in the U.S. House want you to think that they support expanded drilling for oil and natural gas. They don't. Their vote on Tuesday proved it ..... This bill is a total fraud. It gives access to only 12 percent of the estimated oil reserves we are currently not allowed to access. ..... The bill ..... does not allow States to share revenues from oil leases granted there. So States such  as California, which faces a huge budget shortfall, have less incentive to give that approval. Democrats who have opposed expanded domestic drilling forever suddenly found themselves on the losing end of a major economic issue after gas prices hit $4 a gallon. Now they are pushing a phony drilling bill to fool the American people into believing that Democrats support new oil exploration."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Honolulu, Hawaii, Star-Bulletin editorial, "House energy bill falls short of bipartisan solution. Representative Neil Abercrombie's admirable effort to craft a comprehensive energy plan worthy of bipartisan support has been cast aside. Instead, the Democratic House leadership has pushed through a surrogate measure on a  party-line vote that is doomed either in the Senate or by presidential veto, while providing Democrats political cover  from voters angry about high gasoline prices. ..... The bill backed by Pelosi, a long-time opponent of offshore drilling, would keep the ban in effect within 50 miles of the shore. It would allow drilling from 50 to 100 miles from the shore if adjacent States gave their approval and would extend it beyond 100 miles with or without such approval. That means that 88 percent of the estimated 18 billion barrels of oil in waters now under drilling bans would remain off limits."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Examiner editorial. "Pelosi's sham editorial bill is an oily dodge." It says, "The reality is this sham legislation effectively keeps the 26 year-old congressional drilling ban in place for 85 percent of all offshore petroleum reserves. Pelosi's measure allows virtually no drilling within 100 miles of U.S. coastlines, yet that's where most of the untapped resources are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>"Incredibly, that's not the worst of it. Pelosi's bill leaves in place the endless delays created via lawsuits filed by rabid environmentalists. U.S. Representative John Shadegg calls this problem the bill's 'litigation loophole."'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Charleston, West Virginia Daily Mail editorial, "A Drilling Bill That Does Nothing. When House Democrats came back to Washington, they quickly passed a bill that Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of oil-producing Louisiana pronounced dead on arrival in the Senate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on to say: "Pelosi's plan is a slap in the face of Americans. Americans need to be as independent of foreign oil as possible. The public sees that. Yet Democrats refuse to pursue policies that will increase American oil production. This position is senseless, and it is especially so in an election year."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Los Angeles Times editorial: "Wasted Energy Bill. House Democrats' push for expanded offshore oil and gas drilling was more about electoral positioning than drilling, aimed at convincing voters that the party shares their pain at the pump."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then an op-ed in Forbes, "Washington's Offshore Snake Oil. On Tuesday, the House Democrats went on the record supporting an offshore drilling bill in a piece of legislation that now heads promptly over to the Senate to die."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to put the remainder of my comments in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investor's Business Daily Editorial: "Drill-Shy Congress ..... House Democrats have passed an `oil drilling bill that bans drilling where most of the oil is ..... On that first day of the new fiscal year, the congressional prohibitions expire on offshore drilling for oil and natural gas, as well as for the oil shale available in Western states. The Democratic-controlled, do-nothing Congress for once is frantic to do something before that deadline hits. In a big election year, with summer gas  prices exceeding $4 a gallon, voters won't swallow an extension of the ban. So Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday had the House of Representatives pass legislation she unveiled less than 24 hours earlier, with Republicans blocked from offering amendments ..... But Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the Republicans' Study Committee</paragraph>
