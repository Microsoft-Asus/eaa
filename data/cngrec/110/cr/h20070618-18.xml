    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-five years ago, a college applicant could be denied admission simply because she was a woman. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 changed that. Led by the late Representative Patsy T. Mink, who had been denied admission to a medical school because of her sex, and Representative Edith Green, Congress established a principle we often take for granted today, the prohibition of sex discrimination in any federally funded educational program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IX requires that "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal assistance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These 35 words over the last 35 years have had a profound impact, and the results are astounding. More women than ever now attend college, which means more women than ever go on to advanced degrees. In 1972 only 9 percent of law degrees were earned by women. In the mid-1970s, when I attended law school, that number had improved. Women then had made up 15 percent of the graduating class. Today women earn almost half of all law degrees. The story is similar for medical degrees and Ph.D.s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new generation of highly educated women has made a substantial impact on society. Expectations have changed. Girls expect to grow up and contribute to our country and the world in any way they want, as doctors, lawyers, CEOs, school principals, consultants, just to name a few careers previously underrepresented by women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IX also literally changed the face of athletic programs and colleges throughout the country. In fact, it is through athletics that title IX's impact has seeped into the public's consciousness. In athletics the change from 1972 to 2007 is astounding. Today, college athletic opportunities abound for young women. In the past three decades, title IX has led to a 450 percent increase in the rate of female participation in college sports and a more than 900 percent increase in participation at  the high school level. And the recent surge in women's professional sports teams could not have happened without the dramatic increase in women playing college sports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thousands of women athletes in basketball, volleyball, soccer, and other sports, where we can see them, root for them, and even play on the team with them, have had a huge impact. Young girls today take it for granted that they can play a sport and aspire to athletic scholarships to college. My own niece started playing volleyball in junior high, continued in high school, and is aiming for a volleyball scholarship to attend college. Women in my generation did not even consider this a possibility.  Title IX opened the door to higher education for women in many ways, including through athletic scholarships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These successes, both academic and athletic, are worth celebrating, as are the women who came before us here on the House floor as leaders of the title IX movement. In 2002, after Representative Patsy T. Mink passed away, Chairman George Miller introduced a bill that named title IX the "Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This picture of Patsy hangs in my office. She was my friend and continues to be an inspiration to me. I am proud to represent the congressional district that Patsy represented for so long and so well. I know that if she were here today, she would remind us that our work is not done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many challenges still to be addressed. Women continue to face substantial barriers, especially in high-wage fields such as science, technology, engineering, and math. Women own less than 30 percent of all U.S. firms. Women make up only a third of chief executive officers and less than 20 percent of engineers. Sexual harassment remains pervasive in schools and on college campuses. Women's and girls' sports teams still receive only 33 percent of recruiting dollars and 38 percent of athletic  operating dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IX is as necessary today as it was in 1972.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that over 120 of my colleagues are cosponsors on this resolution, including Speaker Pelosi. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in celebrating title IX's successes and in recognizing the work still to be done in our march towards equal educational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Resolution 406 is a resolution honoring the 35th anniversary of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. I would like to recognize my colleague Ms. Hirono for introducing this resolution. The Education and Labor Committee will continue to celebrate the 35th anniversary of this law with a hearing tomorrow on this subject before the Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Nixon signed title IX into law on June 23, 1972. The purpose of title IX was to eliminate discrimination based on gender in the education arena. While title IX applies to all areas of education, it is possibly best known for its role in sports. Thanks to this law, and perhaps more significantly from the growing interest in sports in this country, we have seen a dramatic increase in female athletes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This law is far from perfect. Institutions continue to struggle with how to comply with title IX, trying to balance the participation rates of men with those of women. We do not want institutions to build up female participation at the expense of men's teams at the schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I stated earlier, title IX is best known for its effect on sports. However, title IX does apply to all areas of education. In a time when we are continually talking about the need to educate America's students in the area of math and science, it is important that we also recognize the increasing numbers of female students pursuing careers in math and science. In 2004 the General Accounting Office issued a report on the participation of women in science. The report found that women's participation  in the sciences increased substantially over the past 30 years. However, there is always more that can be done. As Congress looks to reform current programs, we should ensure that the programs being reformed are to encourage all students to enter into the sciences, math, and especially history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee has no stated opposition to this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>, in celebration of the accomplishments of title IX, the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act. I would like to thank my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Ms. Mazie Hirono, for bringing this to the House floor this week as we commemorate the 35th anniversary of this landmark legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IX has forever changed the landscape of opportunity for women and girls. Since the enactment of title IX, the number of women participating in intercollegiate athletics has increased fivefold. The number of female high school athletes has grown by almost 900 percent. In 1972, just as title  IX was enacted, women earned merely 28 percent of the bachelor's degrees in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, better known as  the STEM fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Today, women earn 49 percent of the bachelor's degrees in these fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal point of privilege, I am proud to say that my four daughters, who are considering STEM fields as their professional careers, are proud to see that we remember Patsy Mink.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these successes, we still have work to do to achieve the promises of full equality and freedom from discrimination that is at the heart of title IX. There are still gaps in support for women's athletics, gaps in participation in various disciplines in the STEM fields, and disparities in career and technical education programs. More critically, there is still much to be done to ensure that our educational institutions are free from sexual harassment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a privilege to have served on the Education Committee with Congresswoman Patsy Mink of Hawaii, the original author of title IX. I joined her on the Committee of Education and also on the House floor to defend title IX and its reauthorization, and I am pleased to say we won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is up to us to honor her legacy and maintain the integrity of title IX, which simply states: "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the father of four daughters, I reaffirm my commitment to title IX and the legacy of Patsy Mink today with this vote. I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution, <bill type="hr" number="406">H. Res. 406</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my freshman colleague from Hawaii for bringing this particular resolution. It is appropriate that she honors her predecessor, Congresswoman Mink, who did so much in this Hall. In passing this bill, she did some of the things that were similar to civil rights laws of the 1960s in a continuum, because discrimination, whether it be race or gender or national origin or sexual orientation, is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are barriers this country needs to tear down and present a level playing field and an opportunity for all to enjoy the benefits of America. It is what Dr. King did talk about when he looked forward to getting to the Promised Land. That's part of what the Promised Land was, is, and will be. And so I thank the gentlelady for bringing the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to take an opportunity here to make a mea culpa. Earlier, when I had to address the House on Stax Records, I forgot a few people. And one of the people I forgot was a women, Carla Thomas, who did "Gee Whiz," and her father, Rufus Thomas, who did "Walking the Dog." In music, many of the Stax Record people were men, they were the Staple Singers, but Carla Thomas was a great singer. And there are so many fields that have been opened up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I looked at the statistics that were made available to me, before title IX only 9 percent of the graduates from medical school were women. In 2004, there were 46 percent. In law, 7 percent had J.D. degrees for women, now 49 percent. When you think about those numbers, and that was just 35 years ago, Mr. Speaker, it's amazing how far we've come from the discrimination that existed at that time because of gender and what Representative Mink and the United States Congress' work did. It shows  what can be positive and good about government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of good things that government can do and does do, and people forget that. If it weren't for civil rights pioneers, there would still be segregation. If it weren't for the work of the Congress in the middle 1960s, there would still be discrimination possibly in housing and public employment and other public facilities. And if it weren't for Congresswoman Mink, there would be discrimination against women. There is much good that comes. Forces within society help, but they propel  people in government to act and take action that this Congress has seen has made America a greater place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is my honor to stand and support the passage of this resolution that celebrates the 35th anniversary of title IX. It tells us just how far we've come in 35 years, but how just 35 years ago there were these limits. And the fact is, it was only 87 years ago that women got the right to vote. Mr. Speaker, 87 years ago women could not vote in this country, but this Congress, through a passage of a constitutional amendment, passed eventually by Tennessee as the perfect 36th State, gave women  the right to vote in this country. So we've come a long way, but we've got a long way to go. And it is an honor to participate in this 35th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for giving me the time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I join with my colleagues to celebrate the 35th anniversary of title IX of the Higher Education Act, which assured a woman's right to educational equality. And I thank Congresswoman Hirono for bringing this resolution to the floor and for her leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By ending gender discrimination in all education programs, title IX has given women the chance to excel and to take their rightful place as leaders and achievers on campuses across the United States. No longer would young women find their educational options limited by years of engrained discrimination. Thanks to title IX, women can now prepare for their future--whether in the halls of power or corporate boardrooms--in the classrooms and on the playing fields of America's colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today also gives us the opportunity to honor our former colleague, friend, and champion for women's equality--Congresswoman Patsy Mink. As a member of the Education Committee in 1972, Congresswoman Mink helped craft title IX, and engineer its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The day that the title IX legislation came to the floor, Congresswoman Mink was called away on a family emergency. She knew it would be a close vote. And she was right. That time, the bill was defeated by only a single vote. But Patsy fought on. Through sheer force of will, Congresswoman Mink forced another vote, an uncommon occurrence made possible by a woman of uncommon strength. And that time, women won. Congress passed title IX.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For her determination, the women of America will always owe a debt of gratitude to Congresswoman Patsy Mink.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mother and a grandmother, I have seen firsthand the results of title IX. Some are more visible, like the growing number of girls on soccer fields and basketball courts, the women of the WNBA, or the famous victory of Mia Hamm and Team USA in the World Cup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally important, though less tangible, is the message that title IX sends to women and girls: Your education is crucial and your future is limitless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young women today believe that they can do anything. And they can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For our children, we must continue to support this belief by fulfilling and sustaining the promise of title IX.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="406">H. Res. 406</bill>, celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal of educational opportunities for women and girls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IX changed the way the United States educates its women and girls. It states that, "No person in the United States, shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." This monumental legislation has had far-reaching effects on the women in this country. Title IX may be best known for its changes in athletics, but the academic world has  been significantly changed as well. Since 1981, women have received more bachelor's degrees than men, and since 1986, women have received more master's degrees than men. None of this would have been possible without the hard work of Patsy Mink and Edith Green. Generations of women have and will benefit from the work of these women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor of serving with Patsy Mink for 12 years, representing the State of Hawaii  in the U.S. House of Representatives. She strove to ensure equality and fairness for all Americans. Through her work on title IX, she was able to accomplish just that for every American woman. The renaming of title IX to the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act honors her work and reminds us all of her dedication to equality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should take this time to reflect on where we have come from and the progress we have made. Millions of women have access to the education to make their dreams come true, and that access was guaranteed 35 years ago by a woman who believed that we should all be able to better our lives.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="406">H. Res. 406</bill>, a resolution celebrating the accomplishments of Title IX. I would like to thank Congresswoman HIRONO for introducing this legislation addressing what is an important issue for women's equality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IX requires that schools and colleges receiving Federal funds provide female students with athletic opportunities comparable to those of male students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as critical as this is, we must all begin to realize that Title IX is about more than civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many young athletes, the scholarship opportunities afforded by Title IX might be the only way they can go to college. What is more, female athletes tend to graduate at higher rates, perform better in school, are less likely to use drugs and smoke, and have a more positive body image, more confidence, and better self-esteem than non-athletes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a direct result of Title IX, women's participation in intercollegiate sports has skyrocketed, proving that interest follows opportunity. In 1972, about 30,000 women played college sports. Today, that number has increased by more than 450 percent. Similarly, in 1972, about 200,000 girls participated in high school athletics. Today, that number has increased by more than 900 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be wrong of me to speak about Title IX without taking time to honor my dear friend and beloved colleague, Patsy Mink. In 1972, Patsy helped to enact Title IX and in honor of her valiant work, Congress renamed Title IX the "Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act." She struggled for 30 years to protect educational equity for men and women, and if she were with us today, I am certain that she would be proud of our continued fight to promote equality for all young women  around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we celebrate how far we have come, we must also recognize that we still have a way to go. Women remain underrepresented in school sports, with men receiving 1.3  million more high school athletic opportunities and $148 million more athletic scholarship money each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of such realities, I am proud to join my colleagues to support this resolution, a statement of our determination to recommit ourselves to the causes of education, opportunity, and equality in our society.</paragraph>
