    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, one of the great things that has happened in my political life and serving in Congress is to have known Henry Hyde. Henry Hyde I think was one of the greatest Congressmen to ever serve in this Chamber. He was a man of integrity. He was honest. When he gave you his word, it was his bond. He was loved by everybody. Even during the controversial impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, he did it with honor, and he did it in a way that everybody respected him even  though it was very, very controversial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a great chairman. He was the chairman of both the Judiciary Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, and he did a great job in both areas. I served with him on the Foreign Affairs Committee and I was one of his subcommittee chairman, and I want to tell you, he was a chairman you could be proud of. He was a man who was always ready to listen and work with his subcommittee chairmen and anybody in the Congress to solve problems facing this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was known best, I think, for the Hyde Amendment, which stopped Federal funding for abortions, and it has been known throughout the time since that bill passed as one of the great human life amendments ever presented in this body or in the other body as well. He was a fighter. He was the kind of man who was very strong-willed, who would fight like the dickens. But he had a heart that was very, very soft where his fellow man was concerned. When he was on an issue, however, he had a heart that  was very, very tough, and everybody that dealt with him knew that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was probably one of the greatest orators who ever served in the Congress of the United States in either body. When he came down to speak, everybody listened. You could hear a pin drop. I know when a lot of my colleagues speak today they have to bring the gavel down several times to bring the House to order and ask for regular order, but when Henry Hyde came down on a great cause and spoke, you could hear a pin drop in this place because people knew he had something to say and they wanted to  hear what he had to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud to have known Henry. I knew him for over 20 years in this body. I can't tell you or any of my colleagues how great he was and how much I held him in high esteem. He will be missed not only because he was a great Congressman, he will be missed not only because he was a great chairman, he will be missed because he was a great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And before I leave, I have to tell you one little story about Henry that he was so proud of. When he went to college at Georgetown University, he played on the basketball team. And one of the greatest players, if not the greatest player of that era, was a man named George Mikan, and Henry used to smile and with great pride tell everybody that when he played against George Mikan, in the second half he held him to one point. And there aren't many people who could do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to all of this, he authored the staunchest pro-life legislation in Congress in 30 years, and headed the impeachment hearings against President Clinton. Either of those efforts would naturally incite a whole camp of enemies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Henry Hyde spoke of controversial matters with intellectual honesty and without rancor," said President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He was gifted as a legislator. There was a time when the Illinois House was divided evenly and needed 89 votes to pass a bill, and nothing was getting done because of partisan wrangling. People were angry and debilitated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Henry stood up and said he had voted against something just because he was on the other side of the aisle, and asked the House to reconsider the last bill on its merits. They wound up going back to the last 32 bills that had failed, and he brought people back into an atmosphere of wanting to work together."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Congressman Hyde played a big role in crystallizing the issue of abortion as central to politics and the culture," said Father Frank Pavone, director of Priests for Life. "He has always been a driving force in making it clear that abortion is not one among many issues." Hyde, a Catholic, was a vocal opponent of abortion. In 1976 Hyde attached an amendment to a spending bill that banned Federal funding for abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment later become known as the "Hyde Amendment" and has been at the center of the political fight over abortion since its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This erudite, scholarly man has walked with kings and kept the common touch," Bush stated. "They're quick to say it's not the same Congress without him--but that we're a better country because he was there. And colleagues will always admire and look up to the gentleman from Illinois, Henry J. Hyde."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in 1924, Hyde served in the House from 1975 to 2006 and retired at end of the last session. Hyde served as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from 1995 to 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a written statement, BOEHNER called Hyde "a constitutional scholar, a thoughtful legislator, and a passionate orator."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"But above all, he will be remembered as a gentleman who stood as a beacon for the bedrock principles of liberty, justice, and, above all, respect for life," BOEHNER said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On November 5, President Bush awarded Hyde the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the president can bestow on an American citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry, we miss you, buddy. Godspeed.</paragraph>
