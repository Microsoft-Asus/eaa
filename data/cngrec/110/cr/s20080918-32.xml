    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are keyed up now to start the energy debate on Tuesday. It has been a long, hard 24 hours. Everyone has been working hard. You have to be patient in this business. I especially extend my appreciation to Senators Baucus and Grassley, and it has been difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a terrible natural disaster that has hit. Louisiana--not to denigrate Katrina--they still got hurt, but Texas was devastated. That is the reason this was held up. I understand Senator Hutchison and Senator Cornyn being concerned. I would say to them, if this does not take care of all of the problems, we will have to take another look at it because pictures are worth 1,000 words. We have had a lot of pictures about what took place with this terrible wind storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I wish we could have moved this more quickly. But certain things do not happen as you would want. Next week we have to complete this legislation. We just arrived at a way to move forward on it. We have to do what remains with energy after that. We have to do a CR and maybe a stimulus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still have the Coburn package floating around. So we have a lot to do. We will do our best to try to complete our work by a week from tomorrow. I also appreciate the efforts of my colleague, Senator McConnell. It has been difficult for him because the problems have been on his side. But he has been a gentleman about this and has been probably more patient than I have.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, my good friend, the majority leader, should feel good about this. We are on the cusp of a very significant piece of legislation worked out on a bipartisan basis. I, too, feel grateful to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for their endless number of hours in crafting this truly bipartisan compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it is something the Senate can be proud of achieving. We are set up to reach that achievement on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very grateful to Senators for working to put this together for several reasons: One, this is going to help to create jobs in America. It is going to very much help American families. Third, it is going to help us move more quickly toward energy independence, something we all need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a procedural basis, I very much appreciate that this was worked out on a bipartisan basis. I worked with my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, also with the staffs of the majority leader and minority leader, and other key Senators who worked together to put this together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very grateful, frankly, that we see a glide path now. We are going to get this legislation enacted, hopefully, on Tuesday. Again, my thanks to everyone involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The clerk will call the roll.</paragraph>
