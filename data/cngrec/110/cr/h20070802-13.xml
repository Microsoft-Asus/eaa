    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on May 9, 1961, John F. Kennedy stood behind me and said that the U.S. was going to put a man on the moon in 10 years. That was very ambitious, but we did it. And we're going to have a similar moment of goal setting and aspirations and vision tomorrow when we vote to adopt a renewable portfolio standard for America, where we will guarantee Americans that we will have 15 percent of our electricity coming from clean, renewable sources by the year 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something we know we can do; States are doing it, whole nations in Europe have over 20 percent clean, renewable energy today. And we should follow the spirit of Oak Ridge, Texas, which 2 months ago became the first city in the United States to have all their electricity from clean, renewable, 100 percent biodiesel. This is something the States can do for a variety of reasons. Let's have another "Apollo-John F. Kennedy" moment tomorrow when we pass the renewable portfolio standard.</paragraph>
