  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I stand in recognition of Dr. Ed Renwick, who served as director of the Loyola University Institute of Politics for more than 30 years, until his recent retirement on June 1, 2008. I would like to take some time to make a few remarks on his accomplishments as director and recognize his contributions to the Louisiana community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the director of this unique educational program, he served as a mentor to many future politicians and political experts. His keen ability to explain the nuances of Louisiana politics made him particularly extraordinary and provided his many students with a unique insight into our State's storied history. His teaching methods were groundbreaking as they focused on the empirical ends of Government rather than their theoretical origins. In particular, Dr. Renwick focused on the way in which political  theory works in practice, how it actually affects the daily decisions of elected officials and political candidates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his service as director, he also served as a respected member of the political science faculty, which he will continue to serve following his retirement. As both an administrator and an educator, Dr. Renwick was well known for his insights that jumpstarted the political careers of many Louisianans. In choosing his fellows, he targeted individuals from diverse political, economic and social groups, in order to force bipartisan efforts to work through complex issues important to  Louisiana. Thus, he taught them the importance of finding common ground rather than letting them crumble under their differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was fortunate enough to be a fellow under Renwick, and I can confidently say that I am still benefitting from the knowledge and experience I gained during the program. Dr. Renwick's innovative methods helped reveal the idiosyncrasies of Louisiana politics to his students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, today, I am proud to honor a fellow Louisianan, Dr. Ed Renwick, for his distinguished service to the Loyola University community and the State of Louisiana.</paragraph>
