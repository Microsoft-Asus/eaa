    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored and I want to thank Members of Congress for allowing me to make this statement. This is concerning the death of a very dear friend of mine and a great American that has served our country, Marianne Russo. On November 12, 2007, Ms. Russo died at the age of 71 in her home in Elkdale House in Lincoln University, Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Russo was born on May 7, 1936, in New Canaan, Connecticut. She graduated from Little Red Schoolhouse, New Canaan Country Day School, the Baldwin School and Mount Holyoke College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She earned a master's degree in history at Columbia University and a master's in linguistics at the University of Delaware. During the peak of the civil rights movement, Ms. Russo and her husband, the late Paul Anthony Russo, made a significant contribution to history by teaching at Lincoln University, a historically black institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Russo's passion for teaching and writing prompted her to organize a local writers' group and participated in the Key West Literary Seminar, which created the Marianne Russo scholarship for inspiring writers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to this achieving excellence as a teacher and a writer, Ms. Russo coordinated grass-roots efforts to elect progressive Democratic candidates to serve on local, State and Federal Government levels. In fact, she was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the OxGrove Democratic Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I ask Members of Congress to take time to honor Ms. Russo who is not only a patriot but a great American. Ms. Russo dedicated her life to serving others as a teacher and a published writer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an accomplished author, teacher, political activist, and recipient of numerous awards and honors, Ms. Russo has truly left behind an excellent legacy. Her excellence will continue to shine through her four children and four grandchildren, all of the individuals she enriched in her classrooms, organizations and literary works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Congressional District 17 in Miami, Florida, I have the honor to be the Congressman for her daughter, Monica Russo, President of SEIU Healthcare Florida, and also serves on the international board of SEIU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I have the opportunity and great honor and the blessed privilege to be the godfather for her granddaughter, Giovanna, who I love and appreciate, and I know that she will continue the family legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we recognize Americans like Ms. Russo and her husband, Mr. Russo. They are in a better place now. And what they have left here in this country and here in the United States of America is a sense of pride, a sense of activism, and a sense of love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to state into the Record that a memorial and celebration in her honor celebrating her life will be held on Saturday, November 17, 2007, at 2:00 p.m. at Penns Grove School Auditorium, 301 South Fifth Street, Oxford, Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to furthermore say that many times Members come to the floor to share with the Members of Congress the great contributions of Americans that have moved on to a greater place, some on the battlefield in an area of war, some that were patriots here teaching and pushing Americans to take part in this democracy. I am very proud of Ms. Russo's accomplishments. I know that her spirit will continue to live in this country, and I know there are other Ms. Russos that are out  there that are going to carry the spirit at the grassroots level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to the Russo family that is gathered at the family home to celebrate her life, celebrate her life as though she is still here, because she is. And she will live within you and live within me and live within other Americans that appreciate Americans like her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great honor, before we go on this Thanksgiving break when we surround ourselves with family and friends, to let you know that sometimes we have to cry, sometimes we have to pray, and sometimes we even have joy. I ask during the holiday season, and especially for the Russo family, to live within the joy that you remember in your heart and your mind of her contributions to your family and to our country.</paragraph>
