  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the remarks that I will make and perhaps the Republican leader will make, we are going to resume consideration of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and will immediately proceed to a series of rollcall votes in relation to the remaining amendments and cloture on the bill. The managers are working on a couple of amendments to see if they can be accepted by voice vote. But there could be as many as nine rollcall votes. If we have not completed voting on  these items prior to the caucus time, we will resume votes after the recess.</paragraph>
