    <paragraph>These remarks are so important. I have had the duty--I feel it is my duty--to call home and speak to 55 mothers and fathers and husbands and wives and children of Nevadans who have died in the war. It is a difficult situation. I last week talked to a grandmother whose 19-year-old grandson committed suicide a week after he went back for his second tour of duty. He killed himself in Iraq. These are real difficult situations. I know how strongly Members feel. So I certainly appreciate  the feeling of the Senator from Oklahoma.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, I thank the majority leader for his comments. It will be my intention, after I conclude my remarks concerning a fallen marine, that the floor be given to the Senator from South Carolina, Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM, for a period of approximately 15 minutes.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.</chair>
