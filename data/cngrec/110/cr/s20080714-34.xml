  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Oldenburg Group on the 150th anniversary of the Oldenburg Lake Shore product line. The Oldenburg Group has a major presence in Milwaukee and Rhinelander, WI. What began on the shores of Lake Superior as a line of outboard motors has grown into a significant contributor to our Nation's defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a qualified small business with both military and commercial product lines, Oldenburg Group has shown that they are a leader within the Nation's defense industry. Their products support the U.S. Navy with refueling systems to allow our ships to remain at sea and ready. They support the U.S. Army with systems for offloading war-fighting equipment when no port facility is available, as well as supporting the U.S. Department of Defense in many other ways as well. Oldenburg Group's history of  customer satisfaction and excellence is immensely important as it contributes daily to the security of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is because of quality products and exceptional support service that the U.S. Department of Defense trusts Oldenburg Group to provide vital equipment and services used by the military. Oldenburg's dedication to continually looking toward the future and considering how products can practically be applied to homeland security is one reason for their considerable success, and I congratulate that spirit.</paragraph>
