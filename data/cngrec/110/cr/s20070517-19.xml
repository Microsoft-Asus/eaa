    <paragraph>Mr. President, from April 28 to 30, 2007, approximately 1,200 students from across the country participated in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, an educational program developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The We the People program is administered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the U.S. Department of Education through an act of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 3-day competition, students from all 50 States demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles. The students testified before a panel of judges in a congressional hearing simulation focusing on constitutional topics. I am pleased to announce that Damonte Ranch High School from Reno, NV, won their statewide competition and earned the opportunity to compete in the national finals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The names of these outstanding students from Damonte Ranch High School are as follows: Fabien Dior-Siwajian, Ashley Fanning, Morgan Holmgren, Stephanie Kover, Tony Miller, Amy O'Brien, Stephany Pitts, Austin Wallis, and Eben Webber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to commend the teacher of the class, Angela Orr, who donated her time and energy to prepare these students for the national finals competition. Also worthy of recognition is Marcia Stribling Ellis, the state coordinator, and Shane Piccinini, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People program in Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please join me in congratulating these students on their outstanding achievement at the We the People national finals and wish them the best of luck in the years ahead.</paragraph>
