  <speaking speaker="400081" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people want us to stop bickering in Washington and to start making progress on the many problems we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, many millions of American families face dreaded diseases: cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, you name it. And today we have an exciting opportunity to vote for a chance towards curing those diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year in the Republican Congress, the vast majority of this body and the Senate voted for embryonic stem cell research. This year, the majorities will be even larger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the President not to veto this legislation as he did last year. It is the only veto of his entire Presidency. He is the first President since Thomas Jefferson to have vetoed so few bills, but he chose last year to veto hope. I urge the President not to veto hope this year.</paragraph>
