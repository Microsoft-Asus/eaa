    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was sad to learn that Richard Darman passed away last week. Mr. Darman was a good man, an outstanding public servant, and a great American. I liked him very much. Dick Darman was a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Business School whose career in Washington spanned two and a half decades. He served in five Presidential administrations and worked in six Cabinet departments and the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Darman was a player in many of the important events of the last quarter of the 20th Century. While serving in the Justice Department, he helped arrange the plea bargain that eased Vice President Spiro T. Agnew out of office. Along with his boss, Attorney General Elliot Richardson, he was a victim of the infamous Saturday Night Massacre of the Watergate era. He served in the Reagan administration, eventually rising to the position of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, where he helped formulate  the economic policies of the Reagan revolution and helped negotiate the 1986 Tax Reform Act. And he served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget in the administration of the first President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was during the 1990 budget summit that I really came to know and respect Mr. Darman. I quickly learned that Budget Director Darman was a pragmatist and a realist, who was opposed to budget gimmicks and simple and easy solutions to our Nation's fiscal woes. Concerned about a decade of devastating budget deficits he called for serious, realistic steps to get our Nation's budget under control. And he was not opposed to working with Democrats in seeking those solutions. As a result, we were able  to craft the landmark 1990 deficit-reduction plan--a deal between a Republican-controlled White House and a Democratic Congress that marked a high point of bipartisan cooperation. This budget agreement helped reverse a decade of budget deficits and gave the economy a boost that lasted for more than a decade. Along with President Clinton's 1993 budget agreement, it helped lay the groundwork for the fiscal balance and economic growth of the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This incredibly successful budget agreement, unfortunately, destroyed Mr. Darman's career in government. This man of deep integrity and incredible intelligence was eventually forced out of Government because too many people in his own political party had ideological differences with the contents of the 1990 budget agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I extend my most heartfelt condolences to his wife Kathleen and his three sons and all of his family and friends. I am so pleased and proud to consider myself as one of the latter.</paragraph>
