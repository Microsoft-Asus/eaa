    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me comment a little bit on the same points Senator Kennedy made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an extraordinarily important piece of legislation. The American people--certainly our colleagues in the Senate--need plenty of time to digest and debate and discuss it. It is certainly nobody's intention that this would be rushed. That is why the majority leader made comments earlier this evening that assures all of the Members of this body that not only will we have this week to debate and perhaps amend the legislation, but that upon our return from the Memorial Day recess, we will take  up the bill again and, as he indicated, would have another week, if we needed it, to continue work on the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it is true the legislation did not go through the committee process, I assure my colleagues it was never anyone's intent that there not be the fullest opportunity for discussion and debate. That will in fact occur. We are now on the bill formally. It is also my understanding that technical changes from the draft legislation will be completed tonight and the first amendment will be the amendment of that substitute version. If the distinguished chairman of the committee has any other point  on that, perhaps he could make it. But that would then put before the body the exact language we would begin the debate and discussion on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have about another 5 minutes of comments unless Senator Kennedy wants to say anything else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be in order to thank Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Gutierrez for their work in helping us in the Senate to craft this bipartisan consensus legislation. So much of the enforcement of the legislation will depend upon action by the administration. They had to help us ensure this was a bill that could be enforced in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know during the last election so many of my constituents asked the question: Why should we create a new law for you to enforce when the current law is not being enforced? That is a good question. So one of the things we tried to do in drafting this legislation was to put together a bill that actually would and could be enforced, and the administration has helped us by providing expertise in what it would take for Homeland Security and other departments to actually provide the enforcement the  American people so desperately want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was general agreement that return to the rule of law was the central component of any bipartisan compromise, starting with securing the border, working right up to more enforcement in the interior of the country, and especially at the workplace, to make sure nobody in the future would be hired unless it could be established they were entitled to be hired. That is one of the critical changes in this legislation from the previous law which was not enforceable and, as virtually everybody who  knows this subject appreciates, the law is not being assiduously enforced particularly at the workplace. So that is a critical component of what we have talked about doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a great many other things that will be discussed as we proceed with the legislation. Referring back to my recent campaign, the voters in my State of Arizona, which is being overrun by illegal immigration, had one message loudly and clearly: Do something about this problem of illegal immigration. So I was returned to the Senate by  my constituents with an obligation to do my best to get in and do as much as we could to secure the border, return to the rule of law, ensure that only people who are eligible to work here are permitted to do so, deal with the people who are here illegally in a humane and just way, and try to set up a temporary worker program for temporary workers only, rather than to recreate the problem we have today with a great deal of foreign-born workforce that isn't legal in the United States and is now  demanding to become legal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to get engaged in that process and do something about it, it was important to sit down with people of the other side as well as the administration. Of all the criticism I have received for being one of the sponsors of this legislation, the one I don't quite understand from my constituents is, why would I sit down with Senator Kennedy? What I have tried to tell them is, I understand your anxiety about sitting down with Senator Kennedy, but on the other hand, in a body  of 100 Senators who are supposed to try to work together to find solutions to problems, do you not at least acknowledge that every now and then you have to sit down and talk to each other, even when you are on the other side of the aisle? Senator Kennedy right now happens to be in the majority, in addition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, it is, in my position, important to sit down, articulate what the people of Arizona have told me they would like in any immigration reform, and do my best to try to see that those principles, as much as possible, are included in this legislation. If I didn't sit down with Senator Kennedy, I doubt he would include very much of what I wanted in the legislation he could otherwise draft. So what we have done, in a bipartisan fashion, is to get Senators on both sides of the aisle,  with many different views, agreeing to try to put together something that can pass this body, pass the House of Representatives, and be signed into law. I know every one of us will stand up here and say: This is not the bill I would have drafted if I were king of the world or queen of the world. There is a lot in this bill I don't like very much. But I know that in order to get something,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope as my colleagues consider what we have put together, they will acknowledge you have to start somewhere, but that if there are amendments that go to the heart of this agreement and that break the agreement apart in substantial ways--not ways at the periphery or tangentially but that go to the guts of this agreement--that they can fully expect it will no longer enjoy the support of those of us who worked hard to put the agreement together. If you want to try to kill this legislation, go  right to the heart of it and change any of the major pieces of it, you will find it will quickly lose support, including mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We fully expect Members to have a lot of amendments that deal with different aspects of the bill. There are a million different details, and that is all fine. But if we go to the guts of the legislation and that basic agreement is destroyed, then I think we will see support for it evaporate quickly, including mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking forward to working with my colleagues and debating and discussing this legislation. But at the end of the day, I conclude there is no option of doing nothing, that our only option is to do something. That means sitting down, working together, and trying to get a good bill passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the spirit in which all of my colleagues who have joined in this effort have worked toward this end.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his comments and for his general assessment of the circumstances we find ourselves with. I can certainly give the assurance to the people of Arizona that Senator Kyl is a person of extremely strong views, who has felt very deeply  about the positions he has, but is a person who believes in comity and respect for other views. He understands you can fight for your views and still  compromise without compromising your values. I respect Senator Kyl for that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been pointed out at other times, this has been a long, complex, difficult process, but it is one for which I share with Senator Kyl that failure is not an option. This country cannot tolerate a continued border system which is fractured, which it is today, and with all the uncertainty that exists, whether it is on the borders, or the exploitation of workers, or in terms of the lives of many of the people who are here. We have tried to fashion a program, and we are going to work  together to try to see that it is successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for his comments, and we are looking forward to getting good discussion and debates on these issues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Arizona. I do not know if there is a greater champion in this body on the rule of law on border security. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for being the master at the art of figuring out how to get it done. As a former mayor, I have great appreciation for that. When I was mayor, if it snowed, and the snow wasn't plowed, the next day I heard about it. I think we are here to fix problems. The system we have today is broken and  needs to be fixed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank both my colleagues for their work on this issue. There will be a lot of conversations as time goes on, a lot of debates, but in the end the status quo is not acceptable and we have to fix it.</paragraph>
