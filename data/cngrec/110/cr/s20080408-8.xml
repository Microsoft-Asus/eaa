    <paragraph>Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from Kansas in the well of the Senate. He must be coming over to celebrate the victory of the Kansas Jayhawks last night. I assume that is the reason for his presence. I will let him address that and whatever other matter he may have in morning business. But in noting his presence, even though I know he has some K State leanings, he nevertheless must be incredibly proud of the Kansas Jayhawks, as they won the national championship  last night.</paragraph>
