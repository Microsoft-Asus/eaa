  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are rightfully outraged by the stories coming out of Walter Reed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held its first hearing at Walter Reed to determine how long these problems have been going on and how best we can fix the problems as soon as possible. Three other hearings are scheduled throughout the week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this administration has some tough questions to answer. First, when did they know that wounded military personnel were not receiving the treatment they deserve? The President said he wasn't aware of these problems until the Washington Post investigation, but several GAO reports have been released outlining some of these problems. Was the administration ignoring these reports or just ignoring the problem?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, second, why did the administration choose to privatize services at Walter Reed? And how did they go about choosing a company with ties to Halliburton?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our soldiers deserve better, and I am confident that this Congress will provide the necessary oversight so that we can fix these problems immediately.</paragraph>
