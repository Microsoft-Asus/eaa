    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of North Dakota's oldest communities celebrates its anniversary this week. Abercrombie and the nearby fort after which it is named date their origins back 150 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort Abercrombie is famous for having been the site of one of the most prolonged battles in the American West between Native Americans and U.S. soldiers. Fresh from their triumphs in a Minnesota uprising, Dakota warriors quickly moved to secure their gains by attacking the last military post between the decimated, burning white settlements and the wide open Great Plains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The defenders of the fort were in a desperate pinch. The fort had no protective palisade and little else in the way of defense, it was several hundred miles from the nearest help, and, worst of all, rifle ammunition was critically low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a month the soldiers, and the citizens who had rushed to the protection of the fort, held off Little Crow's warriors. What saved them was the discovery that the metal balls with which the fort's cannon shells were packed were identical to what their rifles required for ammunition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort Abercrombie has a storied history. Military trails radiated out to Fort Wadsworth, Fort Ransom, and Fort Totten. It was here that wagon trains embarked for Montana's gold fields, that the 1870 peace treaty between 900 Dakota and Chippewa delegates was signed, that oxcart caravans from Canada to the Twin Cities overnighted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort Abercrombie is quiet now but houses a handsome State park and historical center. The adjacent community, however, continues to hum. In 1936, an observer called it "an enterprising, live, wide-awake community." That is still an honest description, especially this weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A street dance, military ball, school reunion, parades, wagon train, history tours, and a multitude of other events will fill the days. Although I expect the activity will be as intensive as it was in 1862, it will not be as desperate. Instead, it will be a classic festival of small town America--one of remembrance and homecoming, of neighbors and family, of heritage and pride. I send its citizens birthday greetings and a salute for its proud and singular history.</paragraph>
