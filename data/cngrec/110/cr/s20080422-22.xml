    <paragraph>Mr. President, here we are again not being able to go to the bill. I would hope we could go to this bill tomorrow and debate it all day. As everyone, I think, knows, we would like to have a vote tomorrow night at 6 o'clock on the reversal of the Ledbetter decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have conferred with the manager of the bill and told him I was going to ask consent that in the morning we have the opportunity to go to the bill and legislate--have people offer amendments on it tomorrow--that we would go at 6 o'clock tomorrow to the cloture vote--the motion has been filed--on the Ledbetter decision. I ask unanimous consent that be the case.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, would my friend like me to be a little more specific?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would love for that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, April 23, following a period of morning business, the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> be agreed to; and that the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on <bill type="h" number="2831">H.R. 2831</bill>, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, occur at 6 p.m., with the time from 5 to 6 p.m. equally divided and controlled prior to the vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>We had a unanimous vote earlier today to proceed to the bill. I believe it has been a productive day. I believe Members have learned a lot in the debate, and I think it is important to get the history of the issue on the record for all Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, I am prepared to begin consideration of the bill and for the amendment process to begin as well. Under the rules, my understanding is the cloture vote on Ledbetter would proceed an hour after we convene.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am not in a position to delay the Ledbetter bill, but I am in a position to agree to go immediately in the morning to consideration of <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>. The way the majority leader has worded his unanimous consent request would push off the rules of the Senate, requiring that the Ledbetter vote be in the morning. So, therefore, I have to object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think my friend may have misunderstood my consent request. I think it is appropriate--we would not have to have morning business in the morning. We could go directly to the bill in the morning. We could convene at 9:30, 10 o'clock--whatever would be convenient to the minority--and we would legislate on that all day tomorrow, offer amendments. My friend wants to, I am sure, offer an amendment to change the provision in the bill as it relates to Filipinos. That would  be fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 6 o'clock we would have a vote on a motion that has already been filed to invoke cloture on Ledbetter. That would take 20 minutes. That is all it would take. And then, if cloture, of course, is invoked, then we would be on Ledbetter. If it were not invoked, then we would be right back on <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, I say to my friend, I think it is a good idea we go to the legislation in the morning. I wanted to do it Thursday night. We did not do it Thursday night. We did not do it Friday. We did not do it Monday. We have not done it today. So I would hope on Wednesday morning we could do that. That was my consent: We go to that, we take a brief pause at 6 o'clock tomorrow evening to vote on cloture on  Ledbetter. It would take, as I said, no longer than  15 minutes, maybe 20 minutes if somebody is late for the vote, but that is how long it would take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that seems appropriate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>May I ask a question of the majority leader?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Of course.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>My understanding in the unanimous consent request is that as to the rule that would require us to vote on cloture on the Ledbetter issue 1 hour after we started business tomorrow, under the unanimous consent request, the majority leader has asked that to be postponed until 6:30 tomorrow night. Am I correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes. What I did ask is that the vote on Ledbetter would be at 6 o'clock tomorrow.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Six o'clock. I apologize.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>The reason being--and it is certainly no secret to anyone--we have a number of Senators who want to vote on that matter, and we would ask that be the schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say no one would be inconvenienced with that. If my friends do not accept the consent request I offer, then the only alternative we have is to waste another day because we are postcloture with 30 hours. That time expires at 6 o'clock tomorrow. That is what time it expires. That is why that arbitrary 6 o'clock time was chosen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I repeat, Thursday we could have been on the bill. Friday we could have been on the bill. Monday we could have been on the bill. Tuesday we could have been on the bill. As I have indicated--and I am certain my friend has heard some of the statements that have been made today about our not being able to legislate--we have had to invoke cloture so many different times it is difficult to comprehend, but it is approaching 70 times. It would seem to me it would not be a fruitful use of the time  not to be in session until 5 o'clock tomorrow. Because under the rules--my friend is right--cloture happens automatically an hour after we come into session. So it is going to happen at 6 o'clock no matter what.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would seem to me, as to this important piece of legislation, we should be legislating on it from 9:30, 10 o'clock in the morning--whatever time would be convenient to come in. This request I am making is certainly not an unusual request. We almost always, with rare exception, have cloture votes by consent because, as I have indicated, the rules call for cloture votes taking place 1 hour after we come into session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we set the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>--that was by consent. We, with rare exception, do it by consent. It is not as if we are here suddenly trying to invent the wheel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply stated again, Mr. President, I am saying, at 6 o'clock tomorrow, we are going to have a vote on the Ledbetter reversal. Preceding that, we can have a very productive day and work on this veterans bill. Or we can follow the rules and be out of session all day tomorrow and come in at 5 o'clock and have an hour of debate prior to the cloture vote. So it is established we are going to have a cloture vote at 6 o'clock. The question is, should we have a productive day? We want to have a productive  day. We want to legislate over here on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with my friend, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, we have had a good debate today. I was extremely impressed with Senator Inouye's statement. For someone who is a Medal of Honor winner, I think it means a lot coming from him that we all have a misconception of a lot of things that went on in World War II, not the least of which is the Bataan Death March.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all the movies and everything you see about the Bataan Death March, you see a bunch of White men being driven by the Japanese, many of them to their deaths. That death march had 15,000 Americans and 60,000 Filipinos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was very educational for me. We have had a number of good statements here today. So I would renew my consent request.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Continuing my reservation, Mr. President, as I understand the leader, it is not the minority and it is certainly not me who is suggesting that tomorrow be unproductive; it is the majority leader's desire to change the Senate rules and to move a vote on cloture on the Ledbetter issue from 1 hour after we come into session to 6 o'clock tomorrow night to accommodate people who are not in Washington, supposedly when the Senate is in session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the Senator makes some great observations about the debate today. I agree with him about the heroism of Senator Inouye and others, Senator Stevens, who performed bravely in the Pacific in World War II, and the debate we have had today. If we have learned anything, it is that we have brave Senators, but we also have the history to look at as to whether this benefit was intended for these individuals. That is why the debate was so important that Senator Reid and  I discussed earlier yesterday and we continue now. But with the insistence that we change the Senate rules and delay the vote on Ledbetter, I would have to be opposed to the unanimous consent request.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the comments of my friend from North Carolina. The record is very clear. This is a continuation of my friends on the Republican side wanting to accomplish nothing rather than something. I understand that. I accept that. I have gotten used to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
