    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago the terrorist attacks of 9/11 were an act of war against our entire Nation, not just New York. The whole country was touched; and in the aftermath, people came from every State in the Nation to assist in the massive rescue and recovery efforts. All of these people from all of these States were all exposed to the same deadly toxins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While press reports may question the size and scope of the problem, there is no doubt that there are thousands who are ill because of their exposure. Whether these brave firefighters and fire officers and EMTs came from California, Michigan or Florida, they all breathed the same toxic air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This map shows how many people from each State are enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry; over 71,000 people from every single State in our Nation. At least 28 even came from Hawaii. The list goes on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the message of the map is clear: The 9/11 health crisis is a national problem, and it deserves a strong Federal response.</paragraph>
