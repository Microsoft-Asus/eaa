  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the people of Guam endured a brutal occupation of public executions, beheadings, rape, beatings, forced labor, forced march, and internment in concentration camps during the occupation of Guam in World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why are we just now dealing with war claims? Because a Federal Guam War Claims Review Commission appointed by Secretary Norton reaffirmed what the Hopkins Commission found in 1947, that the Guam war claims issue has not been addressed. And here is this report, over 1,000 pages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this in a clear way. The people who were occupied were ignored by their own government. All war claims were settled by Congress for the American people. The commission found this has never been rectified for Guam. The review commission stated very clearly, Mr. Speaker, this is our moral obligation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge today my colleagues to pass <bill type="h" number="1595">H.R. 1595</bill> to fulfill this moral obligation to American citizens.</paragraph>
