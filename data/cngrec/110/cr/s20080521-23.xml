  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be in a period of morning business, that Senators be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, and that the clerk keep a close count on the time consumed and that this period be for debate only. We are asking colleagues--we do not have a unanimous consent agreement--but we are asking colleagues to confine their remarks to the budget because we have up to 10 hours and, in the interest of getting the work of the Senate done before the  break, it will be most effective and most efficient if we can focus our time on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that after I am done, Senator Gregg be recognized, that I be allowed such time as consumed and the Senator then be given that same opportunity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
