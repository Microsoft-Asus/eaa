    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, freedom is the foundational principle of our society. Our founders were champions of this God-given right and charged future generations with eternal vigilance to protect it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, a handful of people in Washington want Uncle Sam to start telling radio and TV personalities what to talk about, to limit their freedom and ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than fight in the marketplace of ideas, they want to bring back a 1929 radio regulation rule known as the "Fairness Doctrine." Now, don't be fooled. There's nothing fair about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early age of broadcasting, when the majority of news and information was distributed by one or two outlets, it seemed important to promote a competition of viewpoints. That was then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A fairness doctrine today tramples upon freedom of speech and freedom of the press. It dictates to Americans that in an open, free and flooded marketplace of ideas, they need Washington politicians to sort it all out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, real freedom means a government that listens to the people, not one that dictates to the people who they must listen to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's keep the Fairness Doctrine off our airwaves and in the history books where it belongs.</paragraph>
