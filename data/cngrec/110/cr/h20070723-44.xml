    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of <bill type="hr" number="345">H. Res. 345</bill>, a resolution that commemorates the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese. <bill type="hr" number="345">H.

Res. 345</bill> was reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform July 19, 2007, by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Mr. Fossella for seeking to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese of New York, and urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we honor the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese of New York, an institution that has contributed to the good of the region it covers as well and the Nation in a way that people of all political and religious backgrounds can join in applauding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded on April 8, 1808, the Diocese of New York has grown to over 2.5 million Catholics who are led by nearly 1,500 priests. The Diocese of New York was established with the Most Reverend R. Luke Concanen as its first bishop, and was elevated to an Archdiocese in 1850. Upon its origination, the diocese included the entire State of New York and New Jersey, an area that now covers 12 dioceses. In this vast organization, the Archdiocese of New York includes 402 parishes, 278 schools, and 3,729  charitable ministries including Catholic Charities, nursing homes, and outreach programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Archdiocese of New York has been the site of three papal visits and is home to the first Cardinal Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church of America, John Cardinal McCloskey. The first American-born saint, Elizabeth Ann Seton, was a member of the archdiocese and founder of today's Catholic education parochial school system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In commemoration of their bicentennial, the Archdiocese of New York has planned a year-long celebration of activities to bring together the entire community, including an Archdiocese of New York Day of Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great respect for the ongoing service to their parishioners and the greater community of New York that I ask you to join in commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend from Connecticut for managing the time on the minority side for this important resolution. In particular, I want to thank my good friend from New York State, Vito Fossella, for introducing this important resolution commemorating and celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese of New York, a history that is replete with so many tales, not tales but facts, about the contribution of Catholics in New York, in particular about the institution known as the Archdiocese  of New York, having at one time encompassed the entire State of New York and New Jersey, and now having a smaller imprint, but no less significant an imprint today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think of the storied individuals who fervently shepherded their flock in the Archdiocese of New York, starting with R. Luke Concanen in 1808-1810; to present day, Edward Michael Cardinal Egan, who took the reins of control in 2000 and continues to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look back historically, particularly during the Civil War, the Archdiocese had a very long history going back to that point in time, and during  the war Archbishop John Hughes, who was a fervent defender of the Union and a personal friend of then-President Abraham Lincoln, he wrote to President Lincoln and Secretary Seward about the most effectual means for carrying on that war. At the Union's request, he visited Europe to exert his personal influence,  especially in high circles in France, for the benefit of the national cause at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another national cause the Archdiocese was strongly involved in was with the first wave of immigrants, predominantly Irish immigrants, to New York. The archdiocese developed programs to care for and assimilate those new immigrants to America, and was a precursor to the Irish Emigrant Savings Bank, later to become known as the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank and Emigrant Savings Bank today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These organizations over the years have developed into a strong base of charitable giving to keep the traditions of protecting the poor and the neglected, something that the Archdiocese of New York continues to do today. In fact, the Cardinal and the archdiocese have been very outspoken proponents of comprehensive immigration reform to help those least amongst us in society today, something they continue to do in the strong 200-year tradition of the Archdiocese of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was also mentioned before that Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first saint born in the United States, also a New Yorker and the founder of the New York City Catholic school system, and the contributions that system has made to our country. Speaking as a product of there, having graduated from Power Memorial High School in 1980, which is no longer with us, but there are still many high schools that bear the names of the many cardinals and leaders of the archdiocese throughout the years, and others  who have made significant impacts on the Archdiocese of New York, a tremendous system that to this day continues to produce some of the brightest minds in not only the city of New York, but in the country, and also continues to provide access to the least amongst us to give them opportunities that others had before them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand here on the floor congratulating Mr. Fossella for introducing this resolution and to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Archdiocese of New York, a diocese that will go on for many, many years to come. We congratulate Cardinal Egan, Cardinal O'Connor, Cardinal Cooke, and all those who came before them, and all the men women who have contributed in so many ways to its survival and its flourishing throughout the history of New York City and our country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Staten Island, who has been a real advocate for all of New York, Vito Fossella, for such time as he may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400139" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of H. Resolution 345 honoring the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese of New York. I thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for helping pass this resolution. And I thank the gentleman from Queens, Mr. Crowley, for helping spearhead this through, as well as Mrs. Maloney from Manhattan, who were instrumental getting this passed last week out of committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me briefly say at the outset, it was somewhat of a bumpy road to arrive at today's vote. We are nevertheless here to honor the Archdiocese of New York. When we introduced the resolution in May and set about to secure the 50 cosponsors, we got it pretty quickly. It was heartening to see the outpouring of support. Initially the committee balked because of the reference to Cardinal Egan. And on a personal level, I thought it was insulting to the cardinal and professionally, by extension, I thought  it was insulting to the millions of Catholics who comprise the archdiocese.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cardinal Egan is the head of the archdiocese and is a significant spiritual leader of Catholicism in the United States and a man of great integrity and honor. Like those who have come before him, Cardinal Egan has carried forward the mission of his Catholic Church and helped to provide spiritual guidance to millions. I am proud to say the committee realized and recognized the appropriateness of recognizing the role of the archdiocese, and today the Congress has an opportunity to pass this resolution  honoring the Catholic Church and the Archdiocese of New York in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Shays provided some very compelling statistics about the archdiocese so I won't repeat them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the resolution pays tribute to the dedication and character and compassion and values that embody the archdiocese; and, by extension, I think it honors the service and deeds of so many Catholics who have enriched this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you really can't tell the American story without telling the story of Catholics who have come to this country and enriched and made this country better and stronger. Lord knows, over the last couple of hundred years, there have been some great, not just contributions, but some great controversies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1800s there was a political party that was formed in large part, called the Know Nothings, rooted in anti-Catholicism. Fortunately, they have gone away, and the archdiocese of New York, like so many across the country, have remained steadfast and have been institutions that uphold the dignity of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Crowley mentioned Elizabeth Seton, and Seton Hall University is named in her honor in part. The Seton Foundation for Learning, for example, on Staten Island is a school that is principally designed to help children with developmental disabilities and all disabilities and are a strong reminder of the value and wonder of all human life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The archdiocese includes over 3,700 charitable organizations, touching practically every neighborhood across New York City's region, and we know that Catholic Charities alone provides 5 million free meals annually to the less fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, you can't tell this American story without telling the Catholic story. There is probably no more rich archdiocese in this country than the one in New York, and you can't tell the New York story without knowing the archdiocese of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many people who have served in private life have also served their church through faith and in the local neighborhoods I mentioned, and so many police officers and firefighters and civil servants, who not only serve this country with honor and distinction but also serve through their faith the archdiocese. And we saw that very clearly on 9/11 when firefighter after firefighter and their families were laid to rest in the Catholic Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are some of the stories by which we can tell a compelling tale for America; but, today, the Congress, I say thank you to Mr. Davis and Mr. Shays and all who essentially set a little time aside to honor a great institution and celebrate 200 years of serving the poor, the less fortunate with dedication, compassion, and pure social outreach.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>I reserve, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I'd like to just make further comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution has a special meaning to me, as the archdiocese of New York is currently under the spiritual guidance of His Eminence Edward M. Cardinal Egan, who was elevated to cardinal on February 21, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, Cardinal Egan was appointed bishop of Bridgeport by Pope John Paul II. During his tenure in Bridgeport, I had the pleasure of working with him on a variety of issues, including developing housing for senior citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cardinal Egan guided the diocese of Bridgeport and earned a reputation of demonstrated leadership and success in meeting both the physical and spiritual needs of the church's parishioners, and I want to say that he reached out to so many people, Catholic and non-Catholics alike, when there were specific needs that they had. He is such a respected individual in the district I represent, and we were so proud of his elevation to cardinal in New York and believe that he is doing a tremendous job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will conclude by saying I was in his office after his appointment but he had not yet become a cardinal. He just kind of shook his head and said, I wish I was 10 years younger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many demands are made on a leader like Bishop Egan, and he gives every day of his life to this service. So when I vote for this resolution I'm going to be voting for the 200-year anniversary of the diocese and for a really remarkable leader that they have in Bishop Egan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no further requests for time, and I was just thinking that I spent last evening with about 800 black Catholics at the Knights of Peter Claver at their convention in Detroit. Of course, many of them were indeed from the east coast, from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut, and we just simply had a wonderful time. So I join in support of this resolution and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
