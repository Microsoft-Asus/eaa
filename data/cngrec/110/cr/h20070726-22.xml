  <narrative>FARM BILL DOES DISSERVICE TO AMERICANS -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8624]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress from the heartland, I have supported the farm bill in the past. Regrettably, the 2007 farm bill that we will consider this week is a deeply flawed piece of legislation. It combines traditional agricultural programs with the misplaced priorities of the Democratic Congress. Tax increases, budget gimmicks, workplace restrictions, and a public union provision that offends States' rights, and I cannot support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This farm bill is a disservice to American farmers and an attack on hurting families in the State of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the behest of one of the Nation's largest public employee unions, the Democrat Congress added language to this bill that will prohibit States from working with private companies to improve the administration of welfare services. Since Indiana is leading the Nation in improving welfare services through these partnerships, this bill is bad for Indiana, bad for hurting families, and bad for Hoosier taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the interest of federalism, it's imperative that Congress give State governments the freedom to innovate in the delivery of food stamps and other welfare programs to benefit recipients and improve services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will vote against this farm bill because it raises taxes, busts the budget, and does a great disservice to our most hurting Americans.</paragraph>
