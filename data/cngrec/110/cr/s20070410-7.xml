    <paragraph>Madam President, I too wish to welcome everyone back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It had been my hope that the House of Representatives would have appointed conferees on the supplemental appropriations bill for the troops before their departure. I think it is extremely important we finish that bill and get it down to the President for the veto we believe is forthcoming over the language with regard to the troops, the language which, in effect, dictates a withdrawal date and also the excessive spending that is also a part of that  bill.  So the sooner we can get through this process, the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a letter to me, week before last, indicating that if we push this into late April, it creates a lot of problems for the troops. So we hope we can get through this process, resolve our differences, and get the money for the troops at the earliest possible time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the majority leader has indicated, we will be going forward with the stem cell issue. There is an alternative proposal by Senator Coleman and Senator Isakson that we think solves some of the ethical concerns and which will be considered by the Senate. Both will be subjected to the 60-vote threshold, and it is my hope the Coleman-Isakson bill, which could be signed by the President and will actually make a difference, will make it through the legislative process and down to  the President for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, before I go to my formal remarks I have prepared, as I indicated, I have had extensive conversations during the past week with Chairman Obey, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I think we have made progress as to where we need to go in order to do this as soon as possible. There is some controversy over the time limit. We know the President has indicated he needs the money right away, but even last year, when the Republicans were in charge, we finished  the supplemental bill in June and there were no complaints at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a statement from the Congressional Research Service that the money will last until sometime in July. Even the Pentagon itself has indicated the money will last until around the first part of June. So we are going to do the very best we can to complete this as quickly as possible. We know it is important, and we will move forward as expeditiously as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this week, since the House is not here, I intend to continue my dialog with Chairman Obey. I have not spoken to the Speaker today, but I have a meeting with her later, at 5 o'clock, and so we will move forward, and I appreciate the remarks of the Republican leader.</paragraph>
