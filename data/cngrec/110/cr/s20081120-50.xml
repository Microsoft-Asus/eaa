  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="TRIBUTE TO DR. XIAOMING TIAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the outstanding achievements of Dr. Xiaoming Tian. For many years, Dr. Tian has been recognized as a leading practitioner of Chinese medicine, acupuncture and alternative medicine in the United States. I am very pleased that Dr. Tian's recognition was extended worldwide when he received the prestigious World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies, WFCMS, world award for distinguished physician earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This award is the highest honor the WFCMS can bestow, and it is only presented to a handful of physicians each year. This year, only 10 clinical physicians worldwide were honored and Dr. Tian received the distinction of the only recipient in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Beijing. Currently, the federation is chaired by Dr. She Jing, Vice-Minister of Health and Director of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People's Republic of China. The WFCMS includes 174 Chinese medical associations from 55 countries and is the highest global organization of Chinese medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honoring Dr. Tian, the WFCMS reports, "Dr. Xiaoming Tian's great contributions include many different areas such as clinical medicine, research, new Chinese herbal medicine development, education and health care policy. Dr. Tian is highly respected by medical professionals and patients in the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the WFCMS noted, in May of 1991 Dr. Tian established the first Chinese acupuncture clinic at the National Institute of Health, NIH, Clinical Center. This clinic represented the first time that the NIH had formally recognized acupuncture as a routine treatment and had developed a procedure code for it. Dr. Tian became the first clinical consultant on acupuncture within NIH's medical staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his work at NIH, Dr. Tian has taken part in a variety of different research endeavors including an intramural study on the efforts of using acupuncture to treat cancer patients from 1992-1993 and an appointment by President Clinton as one of 20 members of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy set up to report on policy changes that would ensure the potential benefits of complementary and alternative medicine from 2000-2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, as a co-investigator, Dr. Tian participated in a Georgetown University Medical Center study of using acupuncture to treat fibromyalgia. The study, conducted under the auspices of an NIH grant, was a pioneer study in rheumatism research. Dr. Tian has also served as an adjunct professor in the Department of Internal Medicine and Rheumatology at Georgetown University Medical School. He has been the Director of the Wildwood Acupuncture Center and Academy of Acupuncture and Clinical  Medicine since 1986 and, with Professor Shangaing Chen, Dr. Tian established an osteoporosis and osteoarthritis research center at Beijing Medical University in China. Finally, in 2006, Dr. Tian was appointed to a four-year term on the Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine Editorial Board of the National Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query, PDQ, system, the comprehensive cancer database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that we pay tribute to the achievements of Dr. Xioming Tian, who has done so much to help patients with his groundbreaking research and treatment in the emerging field of complementary and alternative medicine. I congratulate Dr. Tian on his distinguished award and ask that he continue his fine work.</paragraph>
