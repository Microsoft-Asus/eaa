  <narrative>SUCCESS FOR BULGARIA AND LIBYA -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8402]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after serving nearly 8 years in a Libyan prison, five Bulgarian nurses yesterday were joyously released home to Sofia, Bulgaria, escorted by Cecilia Sarkozy, wife of the President of France, America's first ally. These nurses and a Palestinian doctor were sadly sentenced to life in prison for allegedly contaminating children with the AIDS virus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This successful outcome could not have been achieved without the diligent efforts of the state of Qatar; the European Union; and the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy. I commend their efforts to reach a peaceful result with Libya. This is positive for the people of Libya and the people of Bulgaria. This is a crucial achievement of extraordinary advances for North Africa and Southeast Europe, who will be partners with America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the co-Chair of the Congressional Bulgaria Caucus along with Congresswoman Tauscher of California, it is my privilege to work with Ambassador Elena Poptodorova. God bless the nurses of Bulgaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th and the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.</paragraph>
