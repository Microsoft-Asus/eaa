  <narrative>TIME FOR A REAL CHANGE AND DIRECTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10630]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of my colleagues in the House and the Senate to exercise the courage to begin a true new direction in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our brave men and women serving in our military are completing every mission they have been asked; and for that I thank them and America thanks them. But the President keeps moving the goalposts and redefining the mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the President announced a potential drawdown of troops from Iraq by July of 2008, leaving approximately 130,000 troops in Iraq. This is no change, and it is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people will not be fooled by these smoke-and-mirror tactics. The President said the surge was intended to provide time for the Iraqis to make political progress; yet, there has been no political progress and no improvement in the situation in Iraq. The Iraqis have only met 3 of 18 benchmarks for success, all the while they are mired in a religious civil war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enough is enough. It is time for real change and direction in Iraq.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
