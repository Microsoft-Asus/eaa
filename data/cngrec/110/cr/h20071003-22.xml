  <narrative>HIGH-TECH BOUNTY HUNTING -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11176]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, high-tech bounty hunting is now occurring in the United States. The Internet allows law enforcement to track down known sex offenders in the United States. States can find convicted sex offenders that must register under the new Adam Walsh Child Safety Act. Failure of a child molester to register is a Federal crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these convicted sex offenders who do not register with local authorities are now being arrested using LexisNexis Internet tracking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Florida police were hunting for a known sex offender. They traced him to Illinois, but Illinois officials claimed the offender was dead. The Internet search tools tracked the child molester to Indiana, where he was arrested for absconding and for failure to register as a known sex offender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies show that convicted sex offenders often remain dangerous and become recidivists once released from prison. Sex offenders are now being held accountable for failing to register; law enforcement is informed of known sex offenders' whereabouts; future recidivism is prevented; and, meanwhile, children are safer because of high-tech bounty hunting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
