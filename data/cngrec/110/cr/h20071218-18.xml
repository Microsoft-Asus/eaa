  <narrative>FCC NEEDS TO LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16649]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the Federal Communications Commission may do violence to its own name. The idea of communication is that you speak, but you also listen. And in a stunning act of bureaucratic arrogance, the FCC today may refuse to listen to the thousands of Americans who have told them to listen to America and not change the media consolidation laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FCC went out and held these hearings, including in Seattle, Washington, where thousands of people came and told the FCC in no uncertain terms that their arrogant effort to remove these productions for the first amendment could not stand, and yet they refused to listen to Americans who told them that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that when we lose access to information, democracy suffers. I hope the FCC today might have second thoughts and decide that part of their job is listening to the American people, in fact, the highest part of their job. And we're going to do everything we can, if they do this today, to stop in the tracks this effort to undo protection against media consolidation.</paragraph>
