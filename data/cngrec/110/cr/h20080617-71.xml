  <narrative>BONNIE RICHARDSON, A CHAMPION IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5464]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Heywood Broun, a renowned sportswriter and life-long champion of the underdog, once said that "Sports do not build character, they reveal it." I've heard it before, but today I finally understand it thanks to Rochelle High School junior Bonnie Richardson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the weekend of May 9 and 10 this year, high school athletes from all across Texas gathered for the State track and field championship. At the meet, athletes compete for two honors, for success in each event as individuals and for the State championship as a team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Bonnie Richardson as a sole member of the Rochelle High School Lady Hornets to qualify for the meet, the Lady Hornets were the ultimate underdog to win a team trophy. Yet, after medaling in all five of her events--winning two golds, two silvers and a bronze--Bonnie found herself in an unlikely position, standing atop the podium to accept the girl's Class 1A team trophy. Her five individual medals earned her 42 points, more than any other school in her team's class. She also wrote herself  into the Texas Track and Field history books as the only female ever to win a State team championship without the help of teammates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Bonnie's accomplishment defines the word "exceptional," the depth of her character is not revealed in her medals or trophies, but in her attitude. Even as her story has been transmitted around the world and back again, her comments reflect a young woman with poise beyond her years. In every article and in every quote, Bonnie has been very gracious to her competitors and modest in her unparalleled achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an era where athletes' behavior and attitudes can be more infamous than celebrated, Bonnie's self-effacing demeanor shows us how sportsmanship should be practiced. I am amazed by Bonnie's athletic prowess, but I am humbled by her easy and free manner in which she praises her opponents, remains grateful for her gifts, and uplifts those around her. Although such an attitude may seem routine to her, a lifetime has taught me that character like hers is not as common as we would all wish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bonnie's quiet confidence extends beyond her abilities in track and field. She is a well-rounded athlete who is an all-state basketball player and an accomplished tennis player. In addition, she is in the running to be named her class valedictorian. It is clear to me that her attitude is an asset in all she undertakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor to represent Bonnie and all the students like her across the 11th District of Texas. As she prepares for her senior year, and as her national notoriety begins to wane, I wish her luck in returning to her version of business as usual--excelling at everything--and success in the upcoming season and beyond.</paragraph>
