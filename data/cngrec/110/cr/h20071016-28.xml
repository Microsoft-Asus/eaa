    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am confident the only thing worse than having to pay taxes is figuring out how to fill out the forms to pay taxes. As Albert Einstein said: "The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax." He was right. It is 16,485 pages. Our income tax is an outrage, an outrage long in need of reform and simplification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week Republicans introduced an alternative to this outrage. The Taxpayer Choice Act does what it says. It gives taxpayers a choice between all the headaches of the current tax system or a highly simplified alternative tax. It simplifies the process for taxpayers and gives them what they deserve, a transparent, efficient, simple and fair Tax Code and completely eliminates AMT tax and makes permanent the capital gains and dividends tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is long time that we pass fundamental tax reform and give taxpayers the choice, the Taxpayer Choice Act.</paragraph>
