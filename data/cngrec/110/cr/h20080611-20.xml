  <narrative>SUPPORT THE NO MORE EXCUSES ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5220]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday the Investor's Business Daily printed an editorial entitled "The Drill Nothing Congress." Here is a short quote from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It is a problem driven by domestic supply restrictions imposed by the Democratic Congress in the face of growing worldwide demand. The Democrats preach energy independence while they do everything in their power to prevent it." The problem they are speaking of is $4 a gallon gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are fed up with a Congress that can't seem to respond to one of their most basic concerns. People are tired of Democrat leaders blocking action to bring down skyrocketing gas prices. So we have introduced a discharge petition to force a vote on the No More Excuses Energy Act. We need to increase domestic production of energy in order to bring down the price of gas at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to sign on to the discharge petition and support the bill when it comes to the floor of the House. There is no excuse not to.</paragraph>
