  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, when most Americans were celebrating annual religious holidays and the beginning of a new year, my family was mourning the loss of one of our favorite and most outstanding relatives, Louis H. White, Jr. Louis White was the husband of my father's sister, Dale White. Their children, Charlotte and Curtis, in addition to being my first cousins, were good friends as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louis White was a member of the fabled "greatest generation," made up of those who left homes and families and volunteered to serve in the armed services during World War II. He left college at Mississippi State University and became an officer in the Army Air Corps. He was qualified soon as a pilot of a B-17 and flying combat missions over Germany. He and his crew were shot down eventually, and he spent several months in a prisoner of war camp before being liberated by the Russians as they  moved into Germany from the east.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, after completing his engineering studies, graduating from college, he became an outstanding engineer, enjoying a career of great success as a paper company executive, where he designed and managed the operation of several large paper mills in Florida, Alabama, and Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My parents, my brother, and I often enjoyed visits with him and his family during holidays, particularly when they were living on Santa Rosa Island, near Pensacola, FL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Louis retired, he was a senior staff project engineer with BE&amp;K, an engineering firm in Birmingham, AL, where he was involved for 11 1/2  years at high levels of management in the paper industry. At his retirement celebration, it was said he should qualify for the "Guinness Book of World Records" because of 52 years of never missing a day of work because of illness or the weather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His first job, incidentally, was at age 14, when he was a dairy delivery boy. He always was dutiful and dependable. In the German prison camp, for instance, he developed an exercise routine that helped save his life and the lives of those who decided to exercise with him every day. He once told me about a Red Cross package that would come with an assortment of things that would help the prisoners survive, that they included things such as vitamin pills, cigarettes, and other things. He would  trade the cigarettes for vitamin pills, for those who wanted to swap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His example of generosity with his voluntary contributions in the communities where he lived to the schools his children and grandchildren would attend, helping install, personally, the infrastructure of cables and wiring necessary for all the classrooms to have computers, for example, were marks of his contribution to his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The quality of his life, the patriotism he displayed, his courage in battle, his survivability under the most difficult and challenging circumstances in the prisoner of war camps, his loyalty to his family and the level of excellence of his career as an engineer in business and industry are worthy of emulation and high praise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my heartfelt compassion and love to his wife and family members who miss him greatly. We wish them well and thank them for the support they gave him throughout his life and his career.</paragraph>
