  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we said farewell last year to our friend, Senator Lott. Today, we welcome his successor, Roger Wicker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Wicker is no stranger to Washington, DC, having served the people of Mississippi's First Congressional District since 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the House, he served as the Republican deputy whip, and he served on his party's policy committee for some 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His distinguished history in the U.S. Air Force has informed his advocacy on behalf of veterans health care and pensions, as well as military construction projects throughout the world. He has also been a strong supporter of health care research and has received numerous awards for his advocacy in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His background and expertise on these and other issues will surely make him a welcome addition to our Senate. So on behalf of all Democratic Senators, I extend my congratulations to him.</paragraph>
