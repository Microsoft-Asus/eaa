  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="259">H. Res. 259</bill>, authored by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo). <bill type="hr" number="259">H. Res. 259</bill> honors  and recognizes the work of the Meals on Wheels Association of America and their annual March For Meals campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Meals on Wheels Association of America is the oldest and largest organization that provides meals to people in need. Through their many programs, Meals on Wheels strives to support the social, physical, nutritional, and economic needs of vulnerable individuals. Meals on Wheels offers tools and information to programs across the Nation and supports these organizations in making a difference in the lives of those at risk. They do this through professional training, creative leadership, and  cash grants. Meals on Wheels helps local senior meal programs provide food and other nutrition services nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunger continues to be a profound problem in our country, Mr. Speaker. Nationwide nearly 38 million people live in households suffering from hunger, up from 33 million in the year 2000. Meals on Wheels is at the forefront of combating hunger by providing nutritious meals to people across the country, those who are elderly, those who are homebound, disabled, or at risk and who are at the greatest risk of going hungry. Even with these impressive efforts, a great need still exists. At this moment  40 percent of Meals on Wheels programs across the country report that there are waiting lists for their nutrition services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the needs for Meals on Wheels will continue to grow. The elderly population in the United States has grown exponentially over the last few decades and will continue to increase well into the mid 21st century. The demographics that will experience the most growth is that of adults age 85 and older. At the same time, the economic insecurity of this elderly population will continue to rise, creating a dire need for services such as those provided by Meals on Wheels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the conclusion of the annual March For Meals campaign, I want to join my colleagues in recognizing the important role that Meals on Wheels programs play all year long all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 259, honoring and recognizing the work of the Meals on Wheels Association of America, its member senior nutrition programs throughout the country and their annual March For Meals campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The senior nutrition programs, authorized under title III of the Older Americans Act, was designed to address problems of dietary inadequacy and social isolation among older people. During fiscal year 2005, 238,000 meals were served to about 2.8 million people. Fifty-eight percent were served to frail older people living at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meals on Wheels is the most recognized name brand of senior nutrition programs. It is the oldest and largest organization in the United States representing those who provide meal services to people in need. Meals on Wheels programs support the independence and well-being of seniors and reduce the isolation experienced by so many elderly. Meals are delivered to seniors' homes, and too frequently the person delivering that meal may be the only person the senior sees all day. The Meals on Wheels  program provides human contact and a safety net, particularly for those seniors living alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several decades, a substantial growth in the elderly population has increased the demand for meal services. Today, Meals on Wheels and other similar senior nutrition programs that seek to feed the elderly report that 4 out of 10 programs have waiting lists for nutrition services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With one baby boomer turning 60 every 7 seconds, the demand for nutrition services will continue to increase. According to a Census Bureau projection, the elderly population in the United States will more than double between now and the year 2050 to 80 million people. It is clear that the work of Meals on Wheels will continue well into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we also recognize the March For Meals campaign which takes place each year during the month of March. This campaign works to commemorate the enactment of the Older Americans Act. It is also a time for Meals on Wheels programs to focus on fundraising, awareness and volunteer recruitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though March has passed, today I stand in support of this resolution and the Meal on Wheels program. I would like to thank Mr. LoBiondo for offering this resolution, and I ask for my colleagues' support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor and recognize the important role of Meals on Wheels and the role that it plays in combating hunger for the neediest among us.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support <bill type="hr" number="259">H. Res. 259</bill>, a resolution honoring and recognizing the work of the Meals on Wheels Association of America and their annual March for Meals campaign. I would like to thank my good friend and colleague, Representative LoBiondo, for asking me to join him as a lead sponsor of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> We all know the statistics related to senior nutrition programs and Meals on Wheels. In my home State of Rhode Island alone, there are an estimated 2,200 meals delivered each day to homebound and elderly clients and over 600,000 meals delivered each year by over 1,000 volunteers. The cost to provide one meal each day for one month is less than $100, by far less expensive than the cost of a nursing home, which averages nearly $5,000 per month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I often cite these statistics because I am proud of the work of my local Meals on Wheels program, but these numbers fail to illustrate one of the more important results from the program. Because these clients are homebound, they are too often isolated from their communities and spend their days alone. Even a brief visit from a friendly Meals on Wheels volunteer provides much needed social interaction and a connection to the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> I have participated in March for Meals in my community, and I encourage other Members of Congress and elected officials to take the time to visit their homebound constituents who receive meals. Unfortunately, one in ten seniors lives in poverty in our Nation and the need for home-delivered meals continues to increase. It is critical that Members of Congress know firsthand the powerful effects of these delivered meals on our seniors, not only to feed their bodies, but to feed their souls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Thank you, again, to my colleague, Representative LoBiondo, for introducing this important resolution and to Meals on Wheels and their volunteers for their tremendous work in taking care of our most vulnerable Americans. I urge all my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="259">H. Res. 259</bill>, and to participate in March for Meals in their home districts.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="259">H.Res. 259</bill>, honoring and recognizing the work of the Meals on Wheels Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established in the 1950s, Meals on Wheels is the oldest private, non-profit, volunteer-based service that delivers nutritious meals to homebound persons, enabling them to maintain their independence and continue to live in their own homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program also provides daily contact with a trained volunteer who provides important social interaction and a link to the community and gives important referral information for other appropriate community resources as needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's elderly depend on this program throughout the country for their meals and other nutrition services. It is crucial that Congress continue to support this important program in order for the most vulnerable people to receive quality meals in the most efficient and effective manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to visit Meals on Wheels in my district and prepare meals and deliver them to seniors. It was such a rewarding experience, and I comment the volunteers of this program for making such a difference in people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the achievements and service of the Meals on Wheels Association of America. Their contributions throughout the United States touch the hearts of millions of people, and I wish them many years of continued success.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="259">H. Res. 259</bill>, honoring and recognizing the work of the Meals on Wheels Association of America, MOWAA, its member senior nutrition programs throughout the country, and their annual March For Meals campaigns. I would also like to thank my colleague Chairman George Miller, of the Education and Labor Committee, for bringing this important legislation to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Meals on Wheels Association of America is the oldest and largest organization in the  United States representing those who provide meal services to people in need. The first home-delivered meal program in the United States started in 1954 in Philadelphia, PA. The Meals on Wheels Association of America gives cash grants to local senior meal programs throughout the country to assist in providing meals and other nutrition services. The mission of Meals  on Wheels Association of America is "to provide visionary leadership and professional training and to develop partnerships that will ensure the provision of quality nutrition services."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To cite just one example, Meals on Wheels of Greater Houston, in my home city, has been addressing the nutritional and emotional needs of seniors for 30 years. Meals on Wheels of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greater Houston currently serves more than 3,300 hungry, homebound seniors. In January, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples awarded $9.5 million in State funding to almost 100 agencies that serve meals to homebound elderly and people with special needs, including $1.4 million to Meals on Wheels for Greater Houston. I personally know of the good work of the Meals on Wheels program because I chaired Houston's Interfaith Ministries Board which ran this program. I would also insure that the  program survived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, senior nutrition programs such as Meals on Wheels report that 4 out of 10 programs have waiting lists for nutrition services. There are 78.2 million Baby Boomers, and one of those Baby Boomers turns 60 every 7 seconds. Every 8 seconds someone else is turning 50. The demand for nutrition services is increasing each and everyday and we must continue to support senior nutrition programs such as Meals on Wheels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The March For Meals campaign has been slowly growing into a permanent part of the Meals on Wheels consciousness. March for Meals is a campaign that takes place at any time during the month of March. The month of March was chosen because it was during this month that the law was enacted that included senior meal programs in the Older Americans Act. Some programs choose to make their campaigns last the whole month, while others concentrate on a single week or day. The biggest component of March  For Meals is the Mayors For Meals Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Meals on Wheels programs generally operate locally, at the county level or smaller. Programs vary widely in their size, service provided, organization, and funding. Although Meals on Wheels Association of America is a national program, each local program is entirely independent. Depending on the program, meals may be delivered by paid drivers or by volunteers. Most clients of Meals on Wheels programs are elderly and programs receiving Federal funding may not serve people less than 60 years  of age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this important legislation recognizes and honors the commendable hard work and dedication exhibited by Meals on Wheels for over the past 50 years. I encourage other Members of Congress to continue to support their local senior nutrition programs by participating in their annual March For Meals events and campaigns. For these reasons, I strongly support <bill type="hr" number="259">H. Res. 259</bill> and urge all members to do the same.</paragraph>
