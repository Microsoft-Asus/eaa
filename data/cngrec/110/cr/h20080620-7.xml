  <narrative>AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD MORE FAILED BUSH-CHENEY ENERGY POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5734]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there are two people to blame for the extremely high increase in gas prices, President Bush and Vice President Cheney, two men who came to the White House from the executive suites of Big Oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the President proposed a proposal that was literally written by the oil industry: Give more public resources to the very same oil companies that are raking in record profits and are sitting on 68 million acres of Federal lands they already have leased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President called for opening the Outer Continental Shelf to drilling, even though more than 80 percent of that is already under lease at this time. The President reported the same old rhetoric about drilling in ANWR, even though his own Energy Department has concluded that will bring no solution for the next 20 years. This type of rhetoric is what is hurting us and will continue to hurt our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, America cannot afford any more failed Bush-Cheney energy policies.</paragraph>
