    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our ally Pakistan is facing a difficult challenge. For those of us who believe that the region that includes Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan is one of our most strategic and Pakistan one of our most important, we want free elections and human rights. But now, we can see the light.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pakistan is losing thousands of Pakistani troops into the region between Afghanistan and Pakistan in order to maintain the protection against the NATO troops. It is imperative that we engage Pakistan, support Pakistan and help them as they begin to try and resolve the crisis of Taliban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many criticize the agreement, but now we can see what happens when that agreement is declared dead by the Taliban. It is important that we work with Pakistan, see the light, stop the accusations and sit down to resolve the best, a safe and secure manner for the U.S. troops, the NATO troops and the Pakistani troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The alliance and friendship between the United States and Pakistan is important. We must find ways to accommodate that friendship to make it work for Pakistan and the United States and the United States military and the Pakistani Army.</paragraph>
