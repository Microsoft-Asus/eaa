  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the American people are about to see what the Democrats have tried to do all year and what we have been prevented from doing all year because of the obstructionism of the Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush is out giving speeches that we have to do AMT. We have to take care of that. He is giving speeches all over the country. He gives press conferences talking about why we aren't doing AMT. Everybody watch. Here is why we aren't doing AMT. They do not want us to do it. They want, at the end of the year, to say: Look, the Democrats are not doing AMT. Everyone should understand we are not doing it because the Republicans, all 49 of them, backed by President Bush, don't want us to do  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have offered them a proposal. We will have a vote with a 60-vote margin on them all--on the bill the House has passed. The bill has passed. The bill passed by the House fully funds AMT. They won't let us vote on that. So I say: OK, let's vote on Senator Lott's proposal, which just eliminates AMT. And then I say: Let's work on the proposal we have from the Finance Committee that has come from Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley which has some extenders  in it that we need to complete this year and then doesn't pay for the AMT. The Republicans don't want the AMT paid for. How much more fair could we be? We are giving them a vote on virtually everything dealing with AMT. But, no, they won't do that. It</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am not going to ask consent to move, as we have previously. I gave the Republican leader a proposal earlier today, as I have in the past, to do just as I have outlined, covering every possible facet of AMT--60 votes on all of them. But, no, no votes on any of them. So now I am left with no alternative but to file cloture on the only measure dealing with AMT that is now before this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the life of me, I don't understand what they are trying to accomplish. What I have heard recently, in the last hour or so, is that now what they want to do is--we have certain tax provisions that are expiring in 2011--they want to vote on those. Now, that is 3 or 4 years away, and we have something that is expiring in a matter of weeks. How do those things tie together? They do not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an effort to thwart the progress of our slim majority, 51 to 49. The Republicans want to go around saying the Democrats aren't doing the work of this country. Well, we have a long list of accomplishments we are very proud of, but also the American people understand that we are agents of change and the Republicans are agents of the status quo. That is what this is all about. They want things to stay the way they have been, and we want to change things, and not only in Iraq. We don't have  another longstanding debate on that. We want to change the course in Iraq, and we want to change course in the way this country has been headed for the last 7 years--into the economic doldrums. And here today, what we want to do is finish a part of what we believe is an obligation to this country, and that is to make sure that when the first of the year rolls around, 19 million Americans don't have a tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone within the sound of my voice should understand, if that comes to be, it can go to 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue because that is what President Bush--he is the man who is pulling the strings on the 49 puppets he has here in the Senate. That is too bad for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I move to proceed to <bill type="h" number="3996">H.R. 3996</bill>. There is a cloture motion at the desk. I ask the clerk to report it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The motion having been filed under rule XXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Cloture Motion</chair>
  <chair>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 487, <bill type="h" number="3996">H.R. 3996</bill>, the AMT tax bill.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Has the Senator not asked consent to go to the House-passed bill?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>No, I said I wouldn't do that. I am sorry if there was some confusion. I said I was not going to do that. I had been told by the staff that there would be an objection, so I indicated I was not going to do that. I apologize to my friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>May I ask the Parliamentarian, what is the state of play? On what was cloture just filed?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="3996">H.R. 3996</bill> was made, and the motion to invoke cloture was filed on that.</chair>
  <chair>The Republican leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think we all can agree we should fix the AMT. We should have done it much earlier this year. Shortly, I am going to present a unanimous consent agreement based on a very simple proposition: Our time is running short; therefore, we should start the debate with the areas of broadest agreement and work from there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what can we all agree upon? We agree it is past time for Congress to act to ensure that 23 million American families do not face a major tax increase this year. While my side of the aisle believes we should permanently repeal the AMT, we are also prepared to ensure that middle-income Americans get tax relief this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We agree tax extenders are important to small business, to parents paying college tuition for their children, to teachers who buy classroom supplies with their own money. These issues are not controversial, and I believe a majority of the Senate supports them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, there is an area of strong disagreement. We disagree with the proposition that taxes must be permanently raised in order to extend current tax policy. By patching the AMT and extending other expiring provisions, we are simply maintaining the  status quo on tax policy. Why should some taxpayers be harmed when no single taxpayer will enjoy increased benefits?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I recommend that we begin where there is a consensus--the AMT patch and tax extenders. We should require the controversial provisions, those raising revenues, be subject to 60 votes. In addition, my side of the aisle would like an opportunity for votes on our vision for tax relief and AMT reform, all of which we understand would be subject to 60 votes. Anything left at the end of the process would also be subject to 60 votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would be a fair process for the short amount of time we have been given on this bill. Let's not tie up the Senate over disagreements; rather, we should build from areas of broadest consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not anticipate the majority leader agreeing to the unanimous consent that I am going to now propound. I want to make sure he is engaged before I do that. Or maybe the chairman of the committee?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>The leader mentioned to me he had an urgent meeting he had to attend. It is up to the leader if he wants to propound his consent now or later.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Montana. I gather he is saying he will take care of the consent for their side? I thank the Senator from Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to consideration of <bill type="h" number="3996">H.R. 3996</bill>, the House-passed AMT bill, and it be considered under the following limitations: There be 1 hour of debate on the bill, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, followed by a vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the bill; provided further, that if cloture is not invoked, then the only amendments in order  to the bill be the following, and be offered in the following order: A substitute amendment to be offered by Senator McConnell or his designee, which is to be an unoffset AMT extension and an unoffset extenders package; a Baucus or designee first-degree amendment to the McConnell substitute which is to be a set of offsets for the extender package; a Sessions amendment related to AMT and exemptions; an Ensign amendment which is an AMT repeal and extends other expiring provisions; a DeMint amendment which relates to AMT and flat tax; provided further, that there be an additional 2 hours</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Montana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a very interesting proposal. I think it is constructive. Now the Senate is engaging on this issue. At an earlier point, a couple or 3 weeks ago, the leader propounded a consent on this subject, and it was objected to and the Senate took no action. But here the distinguished minority leader is suggesting a process. He is suggesting a way, perhaps, to resolve this question. I think the basic implication of his suggestion is that we must and should very definitely  pass legislation this year that prevents about 19 million Americans from paying the alternative minimum tax for tax year 2007 when they fill out their tax returns next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are provisions which are interesting, which I have not seen until this moment--I daresay which I think the leader has not seen until this moment--which have to be worked out before I think there can be an agreement. But there may be something here, the beginnings of something so that we can work out an accommodation. I very much hope that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the next hours and day or two perhaps we can find a way to reach an agreement on what the procedure should be, what amendment will be offered by whom, et cetera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again thank the distinguished minority leader, but on behalf of the leader, on behalf of Senator Reid, I must object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard. The Republican leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana. We will continue discussions in the hope we can get a result that is mutually satisfactory to virtually all the Members of the Senate in the very near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I underline the urgency of curing this alternative minimum tax problem and also underline how strongly the Senators on this side of the aisle are attempting to get that legislation passed as soon as possible. We tried, on this side, to get AMT legislation up before the Senate and passed so that American taxpayers will not have to pay it. That was objected to by the other side. We made many attempts. There were many suggestions by the majority leader to bring up legislation  to prevent the alternative minimum tax from going into effect. They were all objected to by the other side. We are here again trying to get resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leader filed cloture on the House-passed bill so we can get a vote on the issue in an attempt to move the issue forward. I commend him for that. Again it was, in a sense, objected to by the other side because they offered just now a package which is somewhat in the right direction but also has complications in it which raise questions to the degree we can fully get AMT passed. But I want to underline the importance of this body passing legislation to prevent the alternative minimum tax from  affecting about 19 million Americans. We all know this is a pernicious tax, it is a stealth tax. It was not intended to have this effect on so many middle-income Americans. Unfortunately, it has this effect because when it was enacted years ago it was not indexed, and each year more and more American</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is another issue, and that is this: The IRS has sent the 2007 tax forms to the printer. They were sent to the printer on November 16. So each day that we dally here, each day the Congress does not correct this problem, it means it costs the Government more money to correct the forms, to correct the programs that it has to utilize when paying taxes online, whether it is various providers--it is the wrong way to do business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It means a lot more frustration for taxpayers. Just think, if you are a taxpayer and you are beginning to figure out what your income tax is going to be, and suddenly out of the blue, Congress does not change this AMT, it causes huge problems. Just think of the withholding provisions. Americans have a certain amount of dollars withheld from their income as taxes every year, from every paycheck, for example. The calculation assumes the AMT, pretty soon, if it is not corrected--assume AMT will  be corrected. If it is corrected, those changes have to be made on the taxpayers when they withhold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope, again, we get this done. Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the committee, and I have offered a proposal. We have a package we agree on, Senator Grassley and I, to take up and pass legislation which says: OK, nobody has to pay AMT in 2007 who didn't pay it in the previous year. That is the tax year 2007. We are providing it doesn't have to be paid for. That is a big step. But I say that because it is  my judgment that because  the President--because Republicans so adamantly said it cannot be paid for, and because we need 60 votes, that it will not be paid for. That is just a judgment I made. I suggest we bring up legislation, pass an AMT patch for 1 year, and also include the extender provisions which will be paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is where we are going to end up. Everybody knows that is where we are going to end up. If that is where we are going to end up, let's just do it, not go through this kabuki here, these games, not use this as leverage to offer amendments that are going nowhere and will never be enacted, that are just political. But we are unfortunately in a position where we are not yet free to pass legislation that we know at some point we are going to end up with; that is, AMT not being paid for and all  the extenders paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again underline how much we on this side of the aisle are trying to get the AMT passed. Up to this point we are being blocked by the other side. We are going to keep trying. The earlier we get this passed the better because the forms can be sent out more quickly, the computer programs changed more quickly, and we are going to keep at it because it is the right thing to do. And, second, we are going to do it anyway. If it is the right thing to do and we are going to do it anyway, why don't we  do it now?</paragraph>
