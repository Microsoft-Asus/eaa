    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Most Reverend James A. Tamayo, the Bishop of the Diocese of Laredo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Tamayo has admirably served those of Catholic faith in the community of Laredo, Texas, for the past 10 years at San Agustin Cathedral, the oldest Catholic Church in south Texas. His passion for helping the religious community and his dedication to his calling has made Bishop Tamayo an essential part of the community in Laredo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Tamayo came to heed the call of religious service by attending St. Mary's Seminary in Houston, Texas. From there, he graduated magna cum laude from the University of St. Thomas in Houston. After that, Bishop Tamayo became the Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston in 1993, and then went on to become Bishop of the Diocese of Laredo in 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Tamayo currently serves on the Texas Board of Directors in the Texas Catholic Conference as well as the Texas Conference of Churches. He is a member of the Boy Scouts National Hispanic Initiative Committee, building upon the great relationship he has established with the youth in the interfaith community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Bishop James A. Tamayo for his service to the Diocese of Laredo. Words cannot express how much he has done for the people of the city of Laredo and the surrounding communities. His quest to serve others and his desire to better the lives of those in Laredo is truly commendable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you for your time.</paragraph>
