  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize the service of Mr. Dan Mayer, who has been in the banking business for nearly 49 years. Spending the past 47 years in Sturgis, SD, Dan has helped guide peers and new generations alike toward success in the beautiful Black Hills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dan began his career and community service in Sturgis in 1959. After being elected to the Sturgis city council in 1968, he served for 22 years, presiding as president for several terms. In 1973, Dan was part of the group that started the Sturgis Industrial Economic Expansion Corporation, which developed the first Sturgis Industrial Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when Dan and other city leaders met with me to discuss expanding their industrial park, intent on making Sturgis an attractive and effective place to start a business. I was pleased to work with the group to obtain funds for the expansion, which eventually attracted gun and ammunition manufacturers to the industrial park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With nearly five decades of personal and professional ties to the Sturgis area, Dan is still an active force in the community. He currently serves on the Heritage Acres Board, the Sturgis Industrial Board, the Sturgis Hospital Advisory Board, and the Sturgis Water Board. One Sturgis resident is quoted as having said, "Our business wouldn't be here without this man. He believed in our community and, at the most vital of times, he believed in us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dan will be retiring on June 19, 2008 and intends to stay in the Sturgis area, retaining his positions on the local boards. I want to commend Dan for his longstanding and steadfast commitment to the betterment of his community. Being in the banking business for so many years, Dan has been a major influence in the lives of Sturgis area residents. He has seen countless families through home and ranch purchases, home improvements and business start-ups and expansions. Along with his wife Donna,  children Jamie and Mark, and nine grandchildren, Dan has strived to fulfill his commitment of making Sturgis and the surrounding area a greater place to live, work, and raise a family. I am most deeply grateful for the opportunity to thank Dan for his efforts, and eagerly look forward to his continued involvement in the community.</paragraph>
