    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Alan Greenspan's new memoir, "The Age of Turbulence," the former Fed Chair criticizes Republicans for abandoning fiscal discipline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's no wonder: the current Bush administration has racked up over one-third, about $3.2 trillion, of our nearly $9 trillion total national debt. In fact, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush are responsible for incurring almost three-quarters of our total national debt, according to a new analysis from the Joint Economic Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican administrations over the last 30 years have made us a Nation of debtors, vulnerable to the economic and political decisions made half a world away. We need a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats in Congress are committed to getting our fiscal house back in order.</paragraph>
