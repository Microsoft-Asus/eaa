  <narrative>URGING THE PRESIDENT TO VETO THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS'S SCHIP BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11076]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 1998 the Republican Congress enacted the State Children's Health Insurance Program to help children of families near poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But now, true to their big government agenda, the Democrat Congress has sent the President a massive increase in the SCHIP program that will usher in a new era of socialized medicine in America. This bill will take a program designed to help children near the poverty level and expand it to include families with incomes of up to $83,000 a year, and Democrats would pay for this middle-class entitlement with a 61 cent per-pack tax increase on cigarettes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's provide health insurance for children of the poor and the near poor, but let's reject a liberal Democratic Congress's attempt to create middle-class entitlements on the backs of American smokers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, veto this bill.</paragraph>
