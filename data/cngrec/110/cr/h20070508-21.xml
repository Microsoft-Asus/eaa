    <paragraph>Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker. Today is National Teacher's Day, a day which is very important to me and my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's theme for National Teacher's Day is "Great Teachers Make Great Public Schools." And I know that's true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had wonderful teachers in the Jefferson County public schools, and those teachers had a tremendous impact on my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our three daughters are products of Jefferson County public schools, and my sister is a public school teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few other professionals touch as many people as teachers do. Teachers are our role models, our confidants, our taskmasters and our moral compass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to invest in our schools, reduce class sizes and ensure that our teachers have the tools and resources they need to give our children the high quality education necessary to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy.</paragraph>
