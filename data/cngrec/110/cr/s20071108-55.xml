  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 371--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF STATE DRIVER'S LICENSES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT-ISSUED PHOTO IDENTIFICATION TO ILLEGAL ALIENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. A few months ago, I stood on the floor of the Senate to decry the practice of sanctuary cities. Municipalities across this country had identified a loophole in the law and banned the practice of police officers inquiring about a suspect's immigration status, allowing cities throughout this country to become sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said that following the attacks of &#xD0;9/11, we made a promise to the American people to make this country safer; that we identified, on all levels, cracks in our system; and that we found when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing, the consequences can be disastrous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here today again to condemn another policy that flies in the face of post-9/11 thinking. The State of New York will join eight other States in issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. New Mexico is setting up a program where they will doublecheck the illegal immigrant's identity with the Government of Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Polish language newspapers have advertised the ease by which licenses from the State of Maine can be acquired. Tennessee recently stopped the practice of issuing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants in the wake of evidence that illegal immigrants from other States were coming to Tennessee to get licenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To some, issuing licenses to illegal immigrants may seem harmless, if not commonsensical. If they are going to be driving on the streets, why not ensure that they know the rules of the road? The answer is licenses are much more than a permit to drive. The driver's license is a gateway document to a myriad of other services. Providing illegal immigrants with a driver's license affords them access to bank accounts, airline flights, and other resources that the 9/11 hijackers used to attack this  Nation. Beyond national security, driver's licenses allow a person to enter a Federal building, vote in elections, and apply for Government benefits. There is also a considerable question of fraud--when we cannot verify the materials brought to the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish a person's identity, which is certainly the case when we are dealing with noncitizens in an illegal status, you open the doors to corruption, multiple identities, and criminality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate, we have been grappling for several years with the issue of what to do with the 12 million or so undocumented people already in the United States. This Senator would like to find a solution that brings these folks out of the shadows. But the message we have received loudly and clearly from the American public is we cannot get the comprehensive immigration reform until we secure the borders and get serious about enforcing the rule of law when it comes to immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar to sanctuary cities, the issuance of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants is a setback for those who want to see comprehensive immigration reform because it shows we are not serious about enforcing the law. It flies in the face of what the American people expect their Government to do, which is to control our borders, know who is in the country, and appropriately penalize those who have broken our laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was at a coffee this morning with a columnist, Tom Friedman, a native Minnesotan, who addressed a group today. Immigration came up, and he said in passing that to deal with the illegal immigration, he is for a wall but one with a big gate. We need to remain a country that is open to foreign talent. We benefit from having those with Ph.D's and advanced degrees and what they bring in terms of job creation. We need to look at the issue of immigration and at changes in our laws to encourage the  best and brightest to come and contribute to our economy. Until we reestablish the rule of law in immigration policy, we will not be able to get the political consensus that is needed to make any reforms, let alone deal with the 12 million illegals here already.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sooner rather than later, America is going to have to ask itself: Do we want to take immigration and the State of our Nation's security seriously? To the States that issue licenses to illegal immigrants and the cities that have sanctuary city policies on the books, we must ask the question: Why are you undermining immigration laws at the expense of the safety and security of this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am joined by several of my colleagues in introducing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to make the official position of the Senate that States that issue government identification to illegal immigrants, issue driver's licenses, are disrespecting and disregarding Federal immigration laws. The measure also finds these actions present a national security risk and enables election fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleague, Iowa Congressman Tom Latham, has introduced identical legislation in the other body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a former mayor. I am, frankly, deeply concerned, that if there is another attack on U.S. soil and we find that the terrorist was here illegally, if the terrorist was able to obtain a license, if the terrorist was able to move freely about the country, was able to open a bank account, all without the slightest bit of resistance, we are going to have to take a long look in the mirror and ask how we could let it happen. We shouldn't let it happen. It belies common sense to have a policy of  States to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. It makes it difficult to maintain the commitment we have to the American people, that we are committed to enforcing the rule of law. It makes it difficult for us who want to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform if we get to that point.</paragraph>
