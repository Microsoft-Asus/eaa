  <speaking speaker="400641" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's with a heavy heart that I call up for consideration <bill type="hr" number="1275">H. Res. 1275</bill> which honors the life of legendary journalist Tim Russert whose life slipped away suddenly on Friday, June 13, 2008. I would like to thank the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member TOM DAVIS and also Committee Chair HENRY WAXMAN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That said, it is with profound regret that I stand before you on the floor of the House today to mourn and commemorate the life of Tim Russert, an icon of America's media for nearly two decades. Mr. Russert died on Friday after collapsing at NBC's Washington, D.C., home of "Meet the Press" at age 58.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Tim Russert was a former Democratic congressional staffer, Washington bureau chief, and senior vice president of NBC News, the world knew him best as the host of the famous Sunday morning news show "Meet the Press."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his professional journalism accomplishments, Mr. Russert was also a best-selling author, penning the New York Times best-selling memoir "Big Russ &amp; Me" and "Wisdom of Our Fathers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his chair at "Meet the Press," Mr. Russert demonstrated his dedication to Democracy, his passion for politics, his admiration for fairness, honesty, and humanity. Mr. Russert's enthusiasm for journalism and politics earned him the respect and acclaim of so many Americans, including myself and many of my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Buffalo, New York, on May 7, 1950, Tim Russert received his undergraduate degree from John Carroll University, then proceeded to earn a law degree from Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Over the years, he earned 48 honorary doctorate degrees, which serves as further evidence of his prolific impact on the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Tim Russert sat in the front seat of world history chronicling the domestic and international political events that have defined our time, he performed his work with great humanity and quality of character. Tim Russert had a gift for making the all-too-complex nature of Washington politics understandable and compelling for Americans across our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of his work as the epitome of journalistic talent and devotion, Tim Russert won an Emmy Award for his coverage of the funeral of President Ronald Reagan, the Radio and Television Correspondents' Joan S. Barone Award, the Annenberg Center's Walter Cronkite Award, and the Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence in Television Journalism for his interviews of leading national political figures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the former Washington bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal stated, Tim Russert "really was the best political journalist in America, not just the best television journalist in America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, it is my hope that we will join the citizens of this country in recognizing and honoring the contributions of a great American, Timothy John Russert, Junior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="1275">H. Res. 1275</bill> formally expresses our deepest condolences upon the death of Timothy John Russert, Junior, and expends our sympathies to his wife Maureen and his son Luke for their loss. It is a loss that will certainly impact all of us for quite some time to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, earlier today, I attended at St. Albans the viewing service for Tim Russert with Erie County Clerk Kathy Hochul, a trusted friend, former colleague, and student intern of Tim Russert. The tribute based on a line that was extending around the campus is extraordinary and profound to recognize his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to leave you with the story about Tim Russert and how he made it to Washington from his native Buffalo. Tim Russert would always tell that story to highlight the importance of the working-class values that were instilled in him by his father, Big Russ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was the blizzard of 1977 when 3 feet of snow fell on Buffalo with extraordinary winds. Tim Russert was working for Daniel Patrick Moynihan at the time. Moynihan had come to Buffalo to survey the damage from the blizzard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>He was so impressed with Tim Russert, Senator Moynihan said, "Tim, you have to come to Washington; you have great qualities that will serve you very well there, and you can be with me on my staff."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Russert went to Washington and, after a short period of time, was somewhat discouraged. Senator Moynihan had recognized that he was discouraged and asked him what the problem was. Tim said, "Senator, your staff is made up of ideologues, Ivy League-educated people, and I'm from a blue collar background in Buffalo." Senator Moynihan put his arm around Tim and said, "Tim, what they know you can learn. What you know, the values of hard work, of honesty, of love of community, of love of family,  they can never learn."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's with that that Tim Russert started his career in Washington, in both politics first and foremost and then in journalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim Russert was a great man whose time came too early. He had much more to give to us, not just this past Sunday where he would have had Joe  Biden in a one-on-one or a one-on-two and then brought him to task and brought his other guests to task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in fact, his legacy will disappear unless we bring ourselves to realize that the truth should not be a casualty of politics. That's what Tim Russert really brought to bear on "Meet the Press." He made the style about the truth. He invited Republicans, Democrats. I think he had Ralph Nader on more than a few times. He made it a point to bring in people who were interesting, and then he asked them interesting questions. And when they answered, he then brought out the interesting fact that  they perhaps had not yet prepared for. He asked them to tell the truth, and then if that was not the truth or if there was more to be heard in the truth, he brought that out. His research was second-to-none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, he certainly seemed to say every single week, "Go Bills." But as a Clevelander, I am going to take a little liberty today in his name because when it came time to go to a fine college, he went to John Carroll, a Jesuit college in the city in which my high school, Cleveland Heights University High School, was located. He went there because it was a fine education. I'm only surprised that he learned during those years that it was a little less expensive to go to John Marshall for his law  school. So he trotted downtown to Cleveland's John Marshall, now Cleveland State's John Marshall Law School. So he was as much a Clevelander in his education, in his preparation, as he was from Buffalo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that, in fact, his Cleveland roots are something we need to understand because one of the most famous things he ever did was predict in 2004 that it would be "Ohio, Ohio, Ohio," that would indicate the outcome of the 2004 election. I know, Madam Speaker, that you're well aware that Ohio was, in fact, critical, not Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim Russert was the kind of person who really enjoyed that kind of let's call the facts to bear, let's bring them in, let's force people to answer tough questions. He did so whether you were a Republican or a Democrat. He did so whether or not the outcome was one direction or the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that's part of his Cleveland upbringing. I believe it's what made him great. So he will always be remembered for talking about the Buffalo Bills, but for me, he will always be remembered as somebody who was the product of Jesuit education at John Carroll and Cleveland-John Marshall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400641" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I now yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professional journalism and millions around the world are in mourning today and ever since they heard of the passing of one of America's giants of journalism. Hometown D.C. is also experiencing its special brand of mourning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's true that Tim Russert always talked about Buffalo and the Buffalo Bills. He never let you forget where he was from. It was important to him, where he was from. He identified with the Buffalo Bills because he identified with Buffalo and because Buffalo reminded him of his childhood and his church and his working class upbringing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that Tim made his fortune in the District of Columbia and lived in this city. So we adopted Tim long ago as a resident of the city, knowing that his heart was back in Buffalo, but he needed a hometown. This was a man who always needed a hometown, and I can tell you he knew where he lived, and he made me know that he knew where he lived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was, in fact, on his program more than once and especially remember one of his end-of-the-year programs, where he kind of looked at the world and looked at what is going to happen. I love it that somehow Tim understood or at least allowed me to weave into an answer what he expected, which was some notion of voting rights that was still necessary in the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Buffalo and the Buffalo Bills were the only things I know that Tim was not objective about. His gift was somehow to humanize hard news and subjects for interviews by reminding us every so often of Buffalo and the Buffalo Bills and making us laugh and making us know that he was one of us all. At the same time, he managed to be a thoroughly objective reporter and tough interrogator. That, Madam Speaker, is indeed a gift. I don't know of anyone else in broadcast who has that gift.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was both heartbreaking and heartwarming to hear were the many personal stories from Tim's colleagues, not about their professional work with him but about how he related to them and their families as people. That, in a real sense, makes us know that when Tim talked about the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo this was always the human being talking.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400641" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield 1 additional minute to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>By talking about "Big Russ" his father and writing about "Big Russ," Tim was reminding us that he always knew whatever he did on his program, what was important, that family was important. He was not a politician but imagine what kind of politician he would have made? Can you imagine what he would have done in political life?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim took an old, respected format and made it new. Tim revolutionized his species of broadcast and branded it as his own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our hearts are breaking but our hearts go out to Maureen, to Luke, and especially to Tim's beloved "Big Russ."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No story of Tim Russert would be complete if we didn't talk about the loss we're going to have this political season. Clearly, as Barack Obama and John McCain compete for the hearts and minds of the American people, we're going to miss Tim Russert asking the tough questions. We're going to miss him undoubtedly at the debates. Somebody else is going to have to be there to be fair but tough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, additionally, we're going to miss Tim Russert when it comes to the people on both sides of the issue of why we have $5 gasoline and $135 oil. I think Tim Russert would have been just the right guy to hold people accountable, who would talk about the 68 million acres that are "inactive" while, in fact, 41 million are under current lease and use and are producing millions of barrels of oil and natural gas a day, but more importantly, over 2 billion, 2 billion acres are not available  for exploration and development, including the over 50 miles and less than 200 miles off the California coast. Those miles certainly could give us the natural gas we need to fire our electricity in California at a time when we are dangerously close to the lights going out once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, I'm going to miss Tim Russert because this debate is too important not to have, a fact-oriented, unbiased moderator who can, in fact, bring to bear the truth that we need to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise with a heavy heart today because last Friday, one of Buffalo's most cherished sons was taken from us Today, I join my colleagues in celebrating the life of Tim Russert, whose contributions to journalism and American discourse will outlive us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As anyone who watched "Meet the Press" knows, Tim Russert never forgot where he came from. He was an unabashed and shameless fan of anything Buffalo, and that was fitting. He embodied the values of the old steel town: honesty, integrity, and hard work. Instead of forgetting them when he came to Washington, as so many do, he brought Buffalo with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Tim Russert spoke with someone, he was making a friend, not climbing a ladder. While his career soared, he stood with his feet solidly on the ground. A product of his South Buffalo roots, his character was his trademark and earned him the respect of journalists and politicians and all Americans alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim Russert didn't chase ratings by taking cheap shots. He didn't distort his guests' positions to create a news story. He always asked fair questions, encouraged open debate, and held politicians accountable to the people who  elected them. He was the epitome of a journalist, sorely lacking today, and his show was the gold standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would be remiss if I didn't mention his role in honoring fatherhood. Tim Russert reminded Americans of the important role fathers play in child rearing, both through his books and by sharing stories about "Big Russ" and his own son. His admiration for his father and his unconditional love for his son were evident every time he spoke of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be a void on America's television sets every Sunday, and later this fall, the Bills and the Sabers will miss the sounds of cheers from their most loyal fan. But Tim Russert's legacy, his unwavering pride in Buffalo, his devotion to his family, and his indelible mark on journalism will live on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts are with his wife and son and the rest of the Russert family.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Tim Russert personified the best of America. He rose to the top of American journalism. He worked for a Governor, a United States Senator, and received a very good education, but he never ever lost the common touch. He never strayed from his Buffalo roots. He loved to talk about Buffalo. He knew that I had many relatives living in Buffalo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the "Today Show," his son, Luke, called his father "the questioner for the American people." He had a high calling, a mission, a mandate, to ask politicians and public officials the questions most Americans could not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we mourn for Tim Russert, we mourn for his wife, his son, and his father, "Big Russ." We mourn for his colleagues at NBC and the community of journalists, but we also mourn for ourselves at a turning point in the history of our Nation. We mourn for his words, his insight, and his commitment to the people's right to know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless Tim Russert. He will be deeply missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I think the whole country shared in mourning the loss of Tim Russert as if he was part of our family. We had seen him on television for so many years, and he would come into our homes on Sunday mornings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he was so much like so many people in America in that he was passionate about politics, passionate about government, passionate about sports, and passionate about being an American. He loved his Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabers, he loved baseball and he loved horse racing. He loved politics, and he had two great mentors in Senator Patrick Moynihan and in Governor Mario Cuomo, two of the great people in political life to ever have the opportunity to work for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he was a success story, climbing from the ranks of a government official in the media and perfecting that trade and going to the heights of his profession. He was diligent in doing his research and in quizzing everybody, I think, in an even-handed manner that you really didn't know exactly where Tim Russert was coming from. I had the pleasure of meeting him at a Vanity Fair dinner, which I was invited to last year, and we were at a small table. At the time, I didn't know his wife worked for  Vanity Fair. I thought Tim Russert was just there because he was Tim Russert, and that was a good enough reason for him to be there. And he was nice as he could be, just a regular guy, and we had a delightful conversation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He loved his father. And the book about his dad, Russ, has been well spoken about. But I think what's amazing is I have a very good friend in Memphis named Ted Donaldson. And Ted had written a letter to Tim Russert to be included in the book. And Ted's not a bashful guy at all, and Ted came up to Tim Russert at a function, I think it was in New York, and he said, "Hi, I'm Ted Donaldson, I'm from Memphis and I wrote you about my dad." And he said, "Yup, page 45." He knew exactly the page in  the book that it was. He knew his book. He appreciated the people who remembered their fathers and wrote and shared with him. And that book will go on forever remembering the relationship of fathers and sons. I'm sure his son Luke has a great tribute, what he lived and what he remembers from his father and will have a great life. I mourn with him and I'm sorry that he lost his father.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentleman, and to the New Yorkers and Washingtonians that had the privilege of having Tim Russert as their native son and someone who moved to their particular area, and to the State of Ohio where he was educated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank the author of this legislation, the Congressman from New York (Mr. Higgins), the full committee Chair and ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a special tribute that is necessary for this body because we are nothing without words. And Tim Russert was the architect of words that gave politicians a basis of explaining how democracy works. That's what Meet the Press and Sunday morning was all about for many, many Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise to pay tribute to Tim Russert for his life and what he gave to the process of government, and to thank him as well as I watched over the weekend in the times that I was able to see the tributes toward him that he also gave a sense of importance of family, and how he emphasized his wife and his son and of course his family and "Big Russ."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And isn't it interesting that he lost his life on the weekend of Father's Day? But it allows so many to emphasize that he was more than just the moderator, the host of Meet the Press; he was an American who loved this country and loved his flag, but he was also someone who loved his family and showed America that even in all of his energy and all of his business he could stop and smell the roses and appreciate the wonderment of his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I join my colleagues in tribute to him today on the floor of the House and ask, as we celebrate his life, that we will be reminded of the preciousness of democracy and all that we have in benefits to be able to stand on this floor and to espouse our words and to talk about what democracy and freedom is all about. Tim Russert captured it in his love for this process, and his giving to America the ability to understand it in layman's terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my deepest sympathy to the Russert family.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor and remembrance of Mr. Tim Russert, devoted husband, father, son, brother, and friend, whose brilliant legacy as a journalist served to inform the lives of all who knew him well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1991, Mr. Russert's piercing assessment of our Nation's political scene graced America's television screens on NBC's "Meet the Press," enlightening viewers with tough questions posed to political candidates, elected leaders and influential people of our time. In his relentless search for the truth, Tim Russert served to provide the checks and balances critical to maintaining the integrity of our national freedoms. In every interview, with every question posed, Mr. Russert created an atmosphere  of respect, fairness and integrity--an atmosphere in which his ultimate goal as a journalist was sought--discovering the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim Russert grew up in working-class Buffalo, NY, where the lessons of hard work, faith and family remained at the core of his being. He and three sisters, Betty, Kathleen, and Patricia were raised by their dedicated parents, Tim and Elizabeth ("Betty"). A sanitation worker and truck driver, his father worked two jobs to provide for his four children. He carried the lessons of his parents every day and within every interview. One of the most engaging and effective journalists of our time, his  passion and commitment to his profession was  eclipsed only by his devotion to his family and friends. Mr. Russert shared his joy for life with everyone he met, and he treated everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their social standing. Tim Russert never forgot where he came from, and his street-smart common sense, infused with a brilliant mind and kind heart, endeared everyone to him--even his toughest competitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honor and remembrance of Mr. Tim Russert, whose professional legacy raised critical and complex societal issues into the clear light of day. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Maureen; to his son, Luke; to his parents and sisters, and to his extended family members and numerous friends. Tim Russert lived his life with passion and joy, and although he will be greatly missed, the love he shared with family and friends will live on forever,  and he will be remembered always.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there are two types of people in Washington--those known for what they love and those known for what they hate. Tim Russert was known for all the things he loved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He loved politics, as he discovered at an early age and as his two bosses in the industry--Mario Cuomo and Daniel Patrick Moynihan--would learn to cherish. He loved humor. All of America knew his jowly and ever-present smile. He loved the give-and-take of a good, rousing political argument--as I and all who appeared with him on Meet the Press would attest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He loved his family. What moved him finally to write a book? His love for his father. It led to two books, in fact, both of which ended up atop The New York Times bestseller list. His son, Luke, was one of the luckiest kids in Washington. He grew up with a sports-mad dad who took him to every game or match they could squeeze into their days. Nats baseball. Bills football. Wizards basketball. On nights when none were playing, a good high school or college game. Now, Luke and James Carville co-host  a sports talk show on XM.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He loved his faith. He called his time in the Catholic schools of Buffalo the most important of his life. He served on numerous boards and devoted countless hours to working on behalf of his faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He loved the people who make up Washington--the leaders and media moguls, of course. But he also had a strong relationship with those who are never seen in front of the cameras. It was Russert who stood against staff cutbacks and defended the hard-working men and women behind the scenes who made his show a reality each week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of people claim to love, but when it comes time to do the work that exemplifies this love, they fall short. That was not the case with Tim Russert. He did the work. He scooped the competitors. He put in the time with family. He practiced and lived his faith. He lived and died with his teams. He looked out for the big and little people in his midst.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of commentators have seemed surprised by the extensive coverage of his passing, how hard America seems to be taking it. Why? This is just my guess, but I think when the American people watched him every Sunday morning or during election or other news coverage, they saw a little bit of themselves. They saw someone inherently fair, scrupulously prepared, unfailingly thankful and thoroughly, pleasantly humble. He had the conversation with world leaders and newsmakers we like to think we'd  have had if we'd been there. He was us. Part of our families. And we will miss him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1275">H. Res. 1275</bill> honoring the life of Timothy John Russert, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been just days since one of Buffalo's favorite sons was taken from us tragically, and suddenly. We have been touched by the makeshift memorial outside the NBC News bureau in Washington, DC, the flags flying at half-staff outside City Hall in Buffalo and Rockefeller Center in New York City, and the thousands who have come from all walks of life to visit the park right outside South Buffalo that bears the name of this giant of broadcast journalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tim and I walked similar beats, cutting our teeth in New York politics--the tricks of the trade Tim picked up working for the late great Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and former Gov. Mario Cuomo, he took with him to NBC, where he ended up the sparring partner of many a public official, including me. Every time we got together, Tim was tough, but fair--and at the end of the day, we were still two Buffalo guys who could talk shop about the Bills and the Sabres.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though we cannot begin to comprehend the reach of Tim Russert's legacy--we are still a community in mourning--we can say with great certainty that he has left an indelible mark on all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Tim. Go Bills!</paragraph>
