  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my friend Charles Michael "Mike" Nannini, a dedicated public servant who retired last month after 16 years of service to Nevada as an Elko county commissioner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Nannini was first elected in 1992 and has since completed four terms as county commissioner for District 1. When he retired in August, Mike was serving as the chair of the commission--a position he held numerous times throughout his tenure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A long-time resident of Nevada and a graduate of the University of Nevada, Reno, Mike is a devoted and active member of his community. In addition to his time on the Elko County Commission, he has also served on the Elko County Planning Commission and was mayor of Wells, NV. He has contributed to Elko County as a 35-year business owner, a realtor, and a horse and cattle owner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With an unyielding commitment to public safety, Mike served as the Sheriff Department's liaison, fought to bring a juvenile justice facility to Elko County, and served on the Central Dispatch Administrative Authority board. He has also given his time as a U.S. Forest Service and BLM Liaison, on the Metropolis Dam Rehabilitation board, and as a board member for the Heart Project, a tire recycling project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike has also worked hard to bring the citizens of Elko County together--no matter how far-flung they may be. Good communication is essential in rural Nevada, and Mike made an effort to bridge gaps between larger communities and the outlying towns. As a part of this plan, he helped organize rural commission meetings so that the concerns of the unincorporated communities could be heard. Mike also served on the Elko County Fair Board, and established the annual Elko County Employee Picnic to recognize  and thank county employees for their hard work to support Elko County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elko County has prospered under Mike's leadership, and although he is retiring, the benefits of his service will be felt for years to come. One of his long-held goals has been to see a new administration building for the county, and ground was recently broken on this project, which should be completed by 2011. Additionally, Mike continues to work on a project to restore the Bishop Creek Dam so that it may be used for recreational and agricultural needs in the county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After many years of service, Mike will enjoy retirement with his wife Lois and their children and grandchildren. I am grateful for his service and proud to honor him and his achievements.</paragraph>
