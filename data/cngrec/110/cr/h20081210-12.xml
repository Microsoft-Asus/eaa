    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards recently announced their latest list of newly National Board Certified teachers. I am grateful to report that the 176 teachers this round from the Second Congressional District of South Carolina represent the highest number of any district in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the citizens of the Second District are extremely proud and grateful to have such well-qualified professional teachers working to educate their children. Families understand that a strong education is the foundation for future success. We must continue to bring parents, teachers and school administrators together in a common pursuit of high quality, accessible and affordable education. This should be done with the utmost respect for the unique needs and challenges of our local schools.  Our schools should be run by dynamic elected local school boards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank our Nation's professional educators for their dedication to teaching our children and building a brighter future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
