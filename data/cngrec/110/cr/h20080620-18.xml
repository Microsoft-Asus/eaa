  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the House, several months ago on October 16, 2007, to be exact, the House passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation, known as the RESTORE Act. In the view of this Member, the RESTORE Act was a reasonable and balanced one giving the administration the power it needs to combat terrorism while protecting our precious rights and liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today, which I concede includes significant improvements over the Senate legislation, goes beyond what I think was a reasonable bottom line in the form of the RESTORE Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title I of the bill continues the House approach by providing mechanisms to ensure that FISA's longstanding exclusivity is crystal clear. It states only a new statute directly addressing the executive branch's foreign intelligence surveillance authority can modify FISA. Secondly, it provides sunshine by requiring that the government requests to private parties for surveillance assistance must actually cite the statutory authority under which they're issued.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now in earlier versions of FISA reform, the administration claimed that prior court approval of procedures for overseas surveillance would hurt national security. This matter is now laid to rest with the consensus that upfront court review is indeed appropriate. The requirement for individual warrants and probable cause determinations for Americans overseas is an improvement over even the original FISA legislation. There is a provision in the legislation that permits the Attorney General and  Director of National Intelligence to begin surveillance prior to seeking court approval for the necessary procedures in exigent circumstances. This is intended to be used rarely, if at all, and was included upon assurances from the administration that agrees that it shall not be used routinely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure before us further requires extensive oversight by Congress and the independent Inspectors General to prevent abuse. It mandates guidelines for targeting minimization and to prevent reverse targeting and tasks the Inspector General to monitor compliance with those protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now title II of the legislation concerning telecom liability raises the most serious concerns in my view. In the past, I have said I would be open to developing a set of procedures that allow both plaintiffs and defendants to make their case. Unfortunately, this bill goes well beyond that and changes the substantive standard for legal liability by the telecom community, by the telecom companies and does so on a retroactive basis, retroactive immunity. And so I appreciate that the final bill does  not send the matter to a new secret court and does grant the court a meaningful role in the determination. Unfortunately, these improvements do not redeem the overall provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title III of the bill will also ask the Inspector General to conduct independent investigations into the President's warrantless wiretapping program. This inquiry will help uncover the truth for the American people, hopefully, about the President's activities. And then there is a part in here about an emergency provision any U.S. citizen can be wiretapped. And I strenuously object to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years ago, the Administration unilaterally chose to engage in warrantless surveillance of American citizens without court review. We are now restoring the balance through enhanced Congressional oversight, Inspector General investigations, and procedures to ensure that FISA remains the exclusive means for authorizing electronic surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill continues the House approach by providing mechanisms to ensure that FISA's longstanding exclusivity is crystal clear. First, it states that only a new statute directly addressing the executive branch's foreign intelligence surveillance authority can modify FISA. Secondly, it provides sunshine by requiring requests for assistance to cite the statutory authority under which they are issued. A conforming amendment to Title 18 Section 2511(2)(a) is meant to underscore the need to specify  the specific statutory language being relied on, and must be read in conjunction with the entirety of Sec. 102 of the legislation. It should not be read to imply that assistance may be sought for electronic surveillance, as defined in the statute, which is not specifically authorized by statute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In earlier versions of FISA reform, the Administration claimed that prior court approval of procedures for overseas surveillance would hurt national security. This matter is now laid to rest, with a consensus that up-front court review is in fact appropriate. The requirement for individual warrants and probable cause determinations for Americans overseas is an improvement over even the original FISA legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a provision in the legislation that permits the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to begin a surveillance prior to seeking court approval for the necessary procedures in "exigent circumstances." This is intended to be used rarely, if at all. In the normal course of events the DNI will have ample time to submit such procedures to the FISA court for its approval before initiating a particular surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress provided this authority at the request of the DNI to meet unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances, and the Administration agrees that it may not be used routinely. The Administration understands that the Congress expects its use to be very rare if it is used at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oversight committees will be informed of any use of the exigent circumstances provision and are committed to effective oversight to insure that it is not used to avoid the requirement to secure court approval of the procedures in advance in all but the most extreme circumstances. The exception must not swallow the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires extensive oversight by Congress and the independent Inspectors General to prevent abuse. It mandates guidelines for targeting, minimization, and to prevent reverse targeting, and tasks the Inspectors General to monitor compliance with those protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Reverse targeting" is specifically prohibited in Section 702(b)(2). The Intelligence Community agrees that this language prohibits the targeting of one or more persons overseas for the purpose of acquiring the communications of a specific is person reasonably believed to be in the United States. Thus, Section 702(f) requires the government to adopt guidelines to insure that this abuse does not occur and the FISA court must review and approve these guidelines and assure that they are consistent  with the Fourth Amendment. The oversight committees of the Congress intend to conduct rigorous oversight to insure that these provisions are faithfully observed. In this connection the Committee attaches particular importance to the required annual review and the reporting in that review of the number of disseminated reports which contain a reference to the identity of a US person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is currently ongoing multi-District litigation in which a federal District Court is conducting a review of the telecom carriers' activities and the lawfulness of the President's warrantless wiretapping program. This bill does not strip jurisdiction on that Court and provide blanket immunity, as many wanted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, in cases where the program was actually designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack, the Court will assess an Attorney General certification that can assert--among other reasons for dismissal--that the carriers got certain requests and directives from the Administration. The Court will look to see if the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Attorney General's certification is backed up with substantial evidence. That means not only the underlying directives and requests, but supplemental materials as well. And in cases where the Government claims that the company did not provide the alleged assistance, a bald assertion is not "substantial evidence"--the Government will have to back up its claims to the Court's satisfaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That Title II of this bill provides procedures for assessing lawsuits relating to warrantless surveillance since 9/11 does not imply that such surveillance was lawful or that the Congress as a whole believes that the service providers acted lawfully in providing assistance. Nor can the provision remove the power of the courts hearing the cases to determine if this provision is constitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No company or private citizen asked by the executive branch to provide assistance in securing the private information of Americans without authority of law should read this language as implying that Congress will act in the future to provide such a grounds for dismissing a lawsuit. On the contrary, companies should be on notice that the Congress is very reluctantly providing this defense as a one-time action in an extremely unusual circumstance. It expects private citizens and companies to provide  assistance only when specifically authorized by law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 30 years we have mandated that telecommunications carriers not be a merely unquestioning partner to surveillance activities. This bill provides many ways for the companies to question or challenge directives or requests for assistance, and we expect these to be used any time there is something unusual or novel being requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's compromise will give the District Court direction and procedures for handling the pending lawsuits. However, it is important to note that the question of whether FISA's existing security procedures at 50 U.S.C. 1806(f) preempt the state secrets privilege is still being litigated in the courts in a case against the Government. Nothing in this bill is intended to affect that litigation, or any litigation against the Government or Government employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's vote is not the end of the matter. The bill provides for a 4-year sunset, but this doesn't mean we cannot or should not revisit these issues in the next congressional session. We will conduct vigorous oversight, and will be monitoring the program through the reports and audits. We will be keeping a close eye on the development and implementation of reverse targeting, minimization, and targeting procedures, in order to not only make sure that they are followed, but to inform us as we consider  what improvements need to be made to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that note, I will reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, after nearly a year of delays and months of negotiations, the House today will finally vote on compromise legislation that gives our intelligence community the tools that it needs to protect America. I join my colleague, Mr. Hoekstra, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, and Chairman Reyes, as an original cosponsor of this compromise bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's enemies take on many forms, terrorist groups, foreign governments and spies who all pose serious threat to America and its allies. Last August, Congress passed the Protect America Act which provided a temporary solution to the problem. The PAA expired in February. As a result, our intelligence community could not gather two-thirds of the foreign intelligence they needed to protect American lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From day one, we insisted that any legislation passed by Congress must not interfere with our fundamental ability to collect foreign intelligence. This legislation accomplishes that goal. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> does not extend constitutional protections to foreign terrorists and other foreign targets overseas. The bill does allow the intelligence community to target a foreign person overseas without a court order if critical intelligence would be lost or not collected in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We insisted that any legislation passed by Congress include strong liability protections for telecommunications carriers that assisted the government following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as protections for their assistance in the future. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> provides these important protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We insisted that Congress enact long-term FISA legislation. The bill we have before us today will not sunset until the end of 2012. This compromise legislation also provides strong civil liberties protections for Americans both within the United States and abroad. And it mandates congressional oversight and detailed reports to the House and Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees and requires a review by the Inspectors General of the Department of Justice and the intelligence agencies. This  compromise is long overdue. It is supported by both the Department of Justice and the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I submit the following letter for the Record:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June 19, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR-MADAM SPEAKER: This letter presents the views of the Administration on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ("FISA") Amendments Act of 2008 (<bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>). The bill would modernize FISA to reflect changes in communications technology since the Act was first passed 30 years ago. The amendments would provide the Intelligence Community with the tools it needs to collect the foreign intelligence necessary to secure our Nation while protecting the civil liberties of Americans.  The bill would also provide the necessary legal protections for those companies sued because they are believed to have helped the Government prevent terrorist attacks in the aftermath of September 11. Because this bill accomplishes these two goals essential to any effort to modernize FISA, we strongly support passage of this bill and will recommend that the President sign it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last August, Congress took an important step toward modernizing FlSA by enacting the Protect America Act of 2007. That Act allowed us temporarily to close intelligence gaps by enabling our intelligence professionals to collect, without having to first obtain a court order, foreign intelligence information from targets overseas. The Act has enabled us to gather significant intelligence critical to protecting our Nation. It has also been implemented in a responsible way, subject to extensive executive,  congressional, and judicial oversight in order to protect the country in a manner consistent with safeguarding Americans' civil liberties. Since passage of the Act, the Administration has worked closely with Congress to address the need for long-term FISA modernization. This joint</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title I of <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> contains key authorities that would ensure that our intelligence agencies have the tools they need to collect vital foreign intelligence information and would provide significant safeguards for the civil liberties of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Court Approval. With respect to authorizations for foreign intelligence surveillance directed at foreign targets outside the United States, the bill provides that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) would review certifications made by the Attorney General and the Director of NationaI Intelligence relating to these acquisitions, the reasonableness of the procedures used by the Intelligence Community to ensure the targets are overseas, and the minimization procedures used to protect  the privacy of Americans. The scope of the FISC's review is carefully and rightly crafted to focus on aspects of the acquisition that may affect the privacy rights of Americans so as not to confer quasi-constitutional rights on foreign terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets outside the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been clear that any satisfactory bill could not require individual court orders to target non-United States persons outside the United States, nor could a bill establish a court-approval mechanism that would cause the Intelligence Community to lose valuable foreign intelligence while awaiting such approval. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> would do neither and would retain for the Intelligence Community the speed and agility that it needs to protect the Nation. The bill would establish a schedule for court  approval of certifications and procedures relating to renewals of existing acquisition authority. A critical feature of the <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> would allow existing acquisitions, which were the subject of court review under the Protect America Act or will be the subject of such review under the <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, to continue pending court review. With respect to new acquisitions, absent exigent circumstances, Court review of new procedures and certifications would take place before the Government begins the acquisition. The exigent circumstances exception is critical to allowing the Intelligence Community</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exclusive means. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> contains an exclusive means provision that goes beyond the exclusive means provision that was passed as part of FISA. As we have previously stated, we believe that the provision will complicate the ability of Congress to pass, in an emergency situation, a law to authorize immediate collection of communications in the aftermath of an attack or in response to a grave threat to the national security. Unlike other versions of this provision, however, the one in this bill  would not restrict the authority of the Government to conduct necessary surveillance for intelligence and law enforcement purposes in a way that would harm national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oversight and Protections for the Civil Liberties of Americans. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> contains numerous provisions that protect the civil liberties of Americans and allow for extensive executive, congressional, and judicial oversight of the use of the authorities. The bill would require the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to conduct semiannual assessments of compliance with targeting procedures and minimization procedures and to submit those assessments to the FISC and to Congress.  The FISC and Congress would also receive annual reviews relating to those acquisitions prepared by the heads of agencies that use the authorities contained in the bill. Congress would receive reviews from the Inspectors General of these agencies and of the Department of Justice regarding compliance with the provisions of the bill. In addition, the bill would require the Attorney General to submit to Congress a report at least</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title I also includes provisions that would protect the civil liberties of Americans. For instance, the bill would require for the first time that a court order be obtained to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance outside the United States of an American abroad. Historically, Executive Branch procedures guided the conduct of surveillance of a U.S. person overseas, such as when a U.S. person acts as an agent of a foreign power, e.g., spying on behalf of a foreign government. Given the complexity  of extending judicial review to activities outside the United States, these provisions were carefully crafted with Congress to ensure that such review can be accomplished while preserving the necessary flexibility for intelligence operations. Other provisions of the bill address concerns that some voiced about the Protect America Act, such as clarifying</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II of the bill contains, among other provisions, vital protections for electronic communications service providers who assist the Intelligence Community's efforts to protect the Nation from terrorism and other foreign intelligence threats. Title II would provide liability protection related to future assistance while ensuring the protection of sources and methods. Importantly, the bill would also provide the necessary legal protection for those companies who are sued only because they are  believed to have helped the Government with communications intelligence activities in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The framework contained in the bill for obtaining retroactive liability protection is narrowly tailored. An action must be dismissed if the Attorney General certifies to the district court in which the action is pending that either: (i) the electronic communications service provider did not provide the assistance; or (ii) the assistance was provided in the wake of the September 11 attack and was the subject of a written request or series of requests from a senior Government official indicating  that the activity was authorized by the President and determined to be lawful. The district court would be required to review this certification before dismissing the action, and the provision allows for the participation of the parties to the lawsuit in a manner consistent with the protection of classified information. The liability protection provision does not extend to the Government or to Government officials and it does not immunize any criminal conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing this liability protection is critical to the Nation's security. As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence recognized, "the intelligence community cannot obtain the intelligence it needs without assistance from these companies." That committee also recognized that companies in the future may be less willing to assist the Government if they face the threat of private lawsuits each time they are believed to have provided assistance. Finally, allowing litigation over these matters  risks the disclosure of highly classified information regarding intelligence sources and methods. As we have stated on many occasions, it is critical that any long-term FISA modernization legislation contain an effective liability protection provision. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> contains just such a provision and for this reason, as well as those expressed with respect to Title I above, we strongly support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title III would require the Inspectors General of the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and of certain elements of the Intelligence Community to review certain communications surveillance activities, including the Terrorist Surveillance Program described by the President. Although improvements have been made over prior versions of this provision, we believe, as we have written before, that it is unnecessary in light of the Inspector General reviews previously  completed, those already underway, and the congressional intelligence and judiciary committee oversight already conducted. Nevertheless, we do not believe that, as currently drafted, the provision would create unacceptable operational concerns. The bill contains important provisions to make clear that such reviews should not duplicate reviews already conducted by Inspectors General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IV contains important provisions that will ensure that the transition between the current authorities and the authorities provided in this bill will not have a detrimental effect on intelligence operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IV also states that the authorities in the bill sunset at the end of 2012. We have long favored permanent modernization of FISA. The Intelligence Community operates more effectively when the rules governing our intelligence professionals' ability to track our enemies are firmly established. Stability of law also allows the Intelligence Community to invest resources appropriately. Congress has extensively debated and considered the need to modernize FISA since 2006, a process that has involved  numerous hearings, briefings, and floor debates. The process has been valuable and necessary, but it has also involved the discussion in open settings of extraordinary information dealing with sensitive intelligence operations. Every time we repeat this process it risks exposing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for the opportunity to present our views on this crucial bill. We reiterate our sincere appreciation to the Congress for working with us on <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, a long-term FISA modernization bill that will strengthen the Nation's intelligence capabilities while respecting and protecting the constitutional rights of Americans. We strongly support its prompt passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. REYES asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="IV. TITLE IV--OTHER PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today as a sponsor of <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. This bill represents the culmination of more than a year's work by the members and staff of the House Intelligence Committee, together with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, to bring to the floor a bill that modernizes our surveillance authorities while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Conyers for his efforts to strengthen this bill. As always, I greatly appreciate my good friend's commitment to protecting our country and the principles that we hold so dear. I also want to thank the respective ranking members and all that worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, Madam Speaker, enjoys wide support inside the Democratic Caucus. It has been endorsed by our Democratic whip, by our Democratic Caucus chair, by the Blue Dog Coalition, the New Democratic Caucus and by a number of our colleagues. For that, I want to thank in particular our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for leading the effort towards a bipartisan compromise. This bill is a far better deal than the Protect America Act. And it is far better than the Senate bill that passed earlier  this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, intelligence is the first line of defense in our Nation's effort to prevent terrorism and to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This legislation strengthens the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct lawful surveillance of foreign targets. But this legislation also serves another very important and vital function. It strengthens the constitutional rights of Americans, protects them from unlawful surveillance and it stops this President, or any President,  for that matter, from invoking executive power to conduct warrantless surveillance of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill does more than just retain the original FISA requirements for an individual warrant based upon probable cause for surveillance targeting Americans here in the United States. For the first time ever, this bill requires in statute warrants for Americans anywhere in the world. It also requires the government to establish clear guidelines to ensure that no American is the target of any surveillance without a warrant. It clarifies that FISA and Title 18, the Criminal Code, are the exclusive  means by which the government may conduct domestic surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will prohibit any unlawful, warrantless wiretapping, the kind we saw under this administration. It provides accountability by requiring the inspectors general of various agencies to compile a comprehensive report on the President's surveillance program and that review must be given to Congress. It requires prior court approval of the procedures used to conduct surveillance of foreign targets, except in an emergency, similar to the current FISA law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, Madam Speaker, also addresses the issue of lawsuits against telecommunications companies that comply with directives from our government. This bill does not grant immunity to any government official who might have violated the law, and this bill does not grant automatic immunity to telecom companies, as the Senate bill would have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this legislation, a Federal District Court will review the evidence submitted by the Attorney General and then the court will decide whether to grant civil liability and protection to a company that provided post-9/11 assistance to the government. This bill does not grant immunity. Congress isn't deciding the question of immunity; the District Court will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Madam Speaker, this bill will sunset in 4 1/2  years, ensuring that the next administration will be in a position to assess and review the effectiveness of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation represents a bipartisan compromise, and, as such, both sides got less than they wanted. But it is a product of a good faith effort by both Republicans and Democrats to give our intelligence agencies the tools necessary to keep America safe, while protecting our Constitution and our civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this very important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Chairman REYES submitted the following views for the RECORD:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior court review is an absolutely integral part of this bill, but we have also crafted an "exigent circumstances" circumstances provision that allows the Administration to commence surveillance immediately in an emergency. This provision should be invoked rarely, if at all. In the normal course of events, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence will have ample time to submit applications for surveillance to the FISA Court for its approval before initiating a particular  surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When used, this exception should be for purposes of a true emergency, involving unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances. I consider this to be limited to situations where the intelligence sought would serve a critical function in protecting national security and where the failure to act immediately would result in the loss of what might be the only opportunity to collect the information in question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Intelligence Committee intends to engage in regular and vigorous oversight of these new authorities and, in particular, the use of the "exigent circumstances" exception to ensure that the important protections in this bill are not circumvented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"REVERSE TARGETING"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 regularly uses the term "targeting." We intend this term to mean more than simply the process of selecting a telephone number or an e-mail address to surveil. Rather, it is meant to describe the process of purposely acquiring communications of or information about a specific individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in this context that Section 702(b)(2) prohibits what is generally referred to as "reverse targeting." In our discussions with the intelligence agencies, they have agreed that this language prohibits the targeting of one or more persons overseas where the purpose is to acquire the communications of or information about a U.S. person or any specific person reasonably believed to be inside the United States. Accordingly, Section 702(f) requires that the government adopt guidelines to ensure  that this does not occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the nature of the new surveillance authorities granted under this bill, we were particularly concerned about the potential for a significant increase in the inadvertent collection of U.S.-person communications and information. For that reason, we have adopted several oversight provisions that require the Intelligence Community to report to Congress on the number of targets later determined to have been located inside the United States, the number of disseminated intelligence reports  that contain U.S.-person information, and the number of disseminated intelligence reports that contain information</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The exclusivity provision of this bill is extremely important. This language is designed to prevent any future efforts to conduct surveillance that is not authorized by statute. The bill not only establishes that FISA and Title 18 are the exclusive means of conducting surveillance, it requires that any future authorization for surveillance must be explicitly established in statute. The language should in no way be read to imply that there is an inherent power to conduct surveillance beyond what  is expressly authorized by statute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, the language in Section 102(c)(l)(ii) should be read to require citation to specific statutory authority in all certifications for assistance in conducting electronic surveillance issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#xA7;2511(2)(a)(ii)(B).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is set to expire on December 31, 2012. During the next four years, Congress will continue to assess the surveillance activities of the U.S. Government and assess whether additional changes need to enacted before the sunset date to correct any deficiencies or problems that arise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions in title II of this bill establish a meaningful court review to determine whether telecommunications companies should be protected from civil liability for assistance provided to the government. It is important to state that these provisions are not intended to imply in any way that the President's conduct in connection with the President's warrantless surveillance program was lawful or to excuse the conduct of any government official that might have violated the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, no telecommunications company should interpret these provisions to imply that Congress will act in the future to seek the dismissal of any other lawsuits charging improper conduct in connection with surveillance activities. Rather, Congress considers the tragic events of 9/11 to be a unique set of circumstances that require special consideration. As a general matter, we expect companies and private citizens to respect the rule of law and to require the same of its government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the applicable legal standard, we intend "substantial evidence" to apply not only to a finding that assistance was provided in response to a request that  meets the standard of this bill. That standard should also apply where the court is asked to determine that the alleged assistance was not provided. A simple declaration from the Government or the defendant that the alleged assistance did not occur should be deemed insufficient where  there is sufficient evidence to the contrary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, when the Government alleges that a surveillance program was "designed" (as opposed to "intended") to detect and prevent terrorism, the court should examine the evidence to assess the scope of the program and determine, where appropriate, that indiscriminate surveillance that acquires the communications of millions of Americans is not truly "designed" to detect or prevent terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, these provisions should also not be interpreted to remove the power of the courts to review the constitutionality of the process this bill establishes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoekstra for yielding me this initial time that would have the otherwise gone to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you, Mr. Hoekstra, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Smith, for bringing this important piece of legislation to the floor and for working so hard to see that it came to the floor. I would also like to say that I again appreciated the opportunity to work with my good friend Mr. Hoyer, as he spent so many hours and so much time on this. From his staff, Mariah Sixkiller; from my staff, Brian Diffel; Mr. Boehner's staff, Jen Stewart worked hard on this; Chris  Donesa from Mr. Hoekstra's staff was indispensable in his work, as was Caroline Lynch from Mr. Smith's staff. And I got to know frankly and work with Jeremy Bash from Mr. Reyes' staff and Lou DeBaca from Mr. Conyers' staff, and appreciated the real positive contributions they bring to this process every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to suggest that two staffers of my colleague from Missouri, Mr. Bond, Louis Tucker, and Jack Livingston, spent lots of time and lots of productive work on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this represents a compromise, as Mr. Reyes just said, as Mr. Smith just said, that was forged with lots of hard work by lots of people. It accomplishes the goals of the intelligence community. There is no individualized court order for targeting foreign terrorists in foreign countries. There are protections here for communications providers that may have assisted the government. But, as Mr. Reyes just said, those protections will be determined by a court,  not by this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We modernized the law to adapt to changes in technology since the 1978 FISA statute. The bill would accomplish all this while adding new protections and strengthening the individual liberties and privacy protections of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also worked closely with the majority to reinforce the FISA Court's role in procedural certifications and reviews of administration policies, and we created some new obligations for the Attorney General to establish guidelines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, like yesterday's vote, this bill is an example of what we can do when we work together. I thank all those who worked so hard to get it to the floor today. I urge my colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I oppose <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>. It allows widespread acquisition of private conversations without meaningful court review. The bill actually permits the government to perform mass untargeted surveillance of any and all conversations believed to be coming into and out of the United States without any individualized finding and without a requirement that wrongdoing is believed to be involved at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It arguably is not limited just to terrorism. It could be any foreign intelligence, which would include diplomacy and anything else. It is vague on what can be done with the information after it is acquired and who has access to it, and the only court review is a check on whether or not the government certifies that the process has been followed. The court does not review who, what and where the tapping will take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the collection of all of this data can be done under emergency provisions before the court acts, but the collection can continue to be done even if the court later rejects the application if the administration appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also provides retroactive immunity to communications companies who may have violated people's rights, and whether or not those rights have been violated should be reviewed by the courts, not decided here in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we can protect Americans' national security and protect civil rights by providing government access to personal conversations with meaningful court review. This bill fails to do that, and therefore should be defeated.</paragraph>

The bipartisan compromise before us strikes the right balance between providing our intelligence community with the tools they need to fight and find terrorists and protecting our constitutional rights on the other hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank my colleagues Sylvester Reyes and John Conyers, our Intelligence and Judiciary Committee chairmen, for their hard work. I am pleased that we have resolved this critical national security issue through bipartisan negotiations between the administration and the Congress. I want to particularly commend Steny Hoyer, our majority leader, and our Speaker, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy Pelosi, for their leadership in reaching this landmark legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us is a great improvement over the Senate bill in that it provides for more rigorous review of electronic surveillance activities. It gives the courts a meaningful role in determining if telecommunication firms are entitled to civil liability protection.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>From my perspective as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the bill strongly supports the intelligence needs of those who wear the uniform. Every day, American men and women deployed in harm's way depend on electronic surveillance capabilities to achieve their missions. Because of this bill and the work that has been done in this Congress, especially the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, I thank them, and at the end of the day the young men and young women  will be the beneficiaries of this strong legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan compromise before us today strikes the right balance between providing our intelligence community with the tools they need to find and fight terrorists, and protecting our constitutional rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleagues, SILVESTRE REYES and JOHN CONYERS, our Intelligence and Judiciary Committee Chairmen, for their hard work in bringing a strong bill to the floor today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>From my perspective, as the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, this bill strongly supports the intelligence needs of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. Every day, American men and women deployed in harm's way depend on the electronic surveillance capabilities to achieve their missions. This legislation ensures continued delivery of this intelligence to our warfighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to congratulate Chairman REYES and Chairman CONYERS or bringing this strong bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this vital national security measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the compromise bill before us today is not the bill that I would have written. As a matter of fact, the compromise Senate bill we have been trying to get a vote on since February is not the bill I would have written either. But I do believe that the bill before us, imperfect as it is, does do what is needed to protect the country, and therefore I support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A number of people deserve credit, including Mr. Hoekstra, Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Wilson on our side. But I also want to commend the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for the time and energy he put into this issue and for his perseverance in pushing it to a resolution. I know a number of Members on his side don't want to do anything. They prefer operating under an outdated law that makes it impossible to move with the speed and agility we need to have to protect the  country in an age of terrorism. There may be some on this side who would prefer to have a political issue for the fall campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I believe that every day we grow more vulnerable, and that we must act now to give our national security professionals, including our troops in the field, the tools and the information they need to do their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the House has taken some significant steps this week toward ending the disturbing practice of playing politics with national security. When this House is allowed to vote, we can come together and accomplish things for the country. If we can just extend that now into energy and other issues and just allow a vote on the proposals that are before us, we can do good for the country in other areas as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. I appreciate that some improvements have made been made to title I of the bill, but even these improvements are undercut by the scheme in title II that means there will be no accountability and perhaps no adherence to the provisions of title I.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot support the legislation's deeply flawed provisions relating to the issue of immunity for telecommunications companies. These provisions turn the judiciary into the administration's rubber stamp. The review provided in this bill is an empty formality that will lead to a preordained conclusion, dismissing all cases with no examination on their merits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, the courts are not allowed to ask whether the conduct of the corporations who assisted was in fact legal. They may only note that the administration says that it was legal. In other words, the decision on the ultimate question of legality, a decision the Constitution dedicates to the judiciary, will instead be made by the executive branch with the judiciary acting as a rubber stamp. It turns the process of judicial review into a joke and denigrates this supposedly independent  and coequal branch of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It's all the more aggravating because immunity already exists in the law under 18 U.S.C., section 2511. It provides that telecommunications companies are immune from suit if the company has been provided with a court order or a certification by the Attorney General, in writing, that the order has been obtained or is unnecessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot support this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is at war. We have to do all we can to protect our Nation from those who seek to harm this country, our communities and our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After nearly a year of delays, we finally have before us a bill that will institute a long-term fix to our Nation's foreign intelligence surveillance laws and provide the intelligence community with the tools it needs to protect this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in particular appreciation of Republican Whip Roy Blunt, Ranking Member Smith and Mr. Hoekstra. These Republicans stood firm and have succeeded in negotiating a strong 4-year extension to our surveillance laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill is tough on terrorists, it includes strong protections for civil liberties and Americans that have also been put in place by extensive measures of oversight and review in the Department of Justice, and it protects those patriotic telecommunications companies who assisted the Federal Government in the wake of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I endorse these reforms and safeguards, let me say, Madam Speaker, Congress and future administrations must be vigilant to ensure that the exigent circumstances exceptions are practiced in a way that preserves Presidential discretion when conducting real-time foreign intelligence. Speaking less as a Congressman and more as a father, and as an American who was here on September 11, I am grateful to my colleagues in both parties for bringing this important compromise to the floor and making  sure that our intelligence community, those who work tirelessly every day to protect us, have the tools they need to prevent the horrors of that day from ever being visited on our soil again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my phones are ringing off the hook, and my e-mail accounts are full. By the hundreds and hundreds, my constituents are saying, "don't cave in," "don't toss due process out the window," "no compromise on our civil liberties" and "all surveillance of Americans should require a warrant." One of the most powerful, "The U.S. Constitution has been `marked up.' Don't shred it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree, now and always. The hard part is deciding whether the FISA compromise before us meets my constituents' requirements and my own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After reading every word of it, and after many, many hours working to develop and revise portions of it, I conclude that the compromise replaces bad law, the Protect America Act, with law that actually improves many of the provisions of the underlying FISA law which has served our country well for three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me highlight three issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this bill makes clear that no president can ignore it ever again. FISA is the exclusive means by which our government can conduct surveillance. In short, no more warrantless surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it expands the circumstances for which individual warrants are required, by including Americans outside the U.S., and it protects Americans from so-called reverse targeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it requires Federal court review to determine whether communications firms, which assisted in post-9/11 activities, get civil liability protection. If the evidence is inadequate, courts can deny immunity, and immunity does not cover government officials who may have violated the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have lived with FISA up close and personal for many years. I am angry about the way the Bush administration abused it and disrespected Congress. My constituents are right to demand that Congress show courage and stand up for the Constitution. Security and liberty are reinforcing values, not a zero-sum gain. This bill, though imperfect, protects both.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, America cannot afford to have a pre-9/11 mentality when it comes to national security. I think that's why this bill is so critical and why Members and staff have been working so hard to craft it. I recognize the serious threat that we face, and it keeps our Nation on offense when it comes to protecting the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our intelligence officials must have the ability to monitor terrorists suspected of plotting to kill Americans. This measure ensures that the tools that they need will be there to help keep America safe. They have retroactive liability protections for firms that have aided the government and have worked with our government at our request to help detect and prevent attacks. We should protect those companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it also protects the civil liberties of all Americans. This is an important piece of legislation. It has taken an awful lot of time to get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But just like yesterday, when Members on both sides of the aisle work together, we can come to an agreement. We can come to a compromise that's in the best interest of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two days in a row we have had two great examples of how we can craft very good bills by working in a bipartisan manner. I want to congratulate all the Members on both sides of the aisle and their staffs who have worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400289" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in order to uphold the principle of the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution, we must reject this bill. This bill limits the courts hearing lawsuits alleging illegal wiretapping, to considering only whether the telecom companies received a "written request or directive indicating that the activity was authorized by the President and determined to be lawful," not whether that request was actually lawful or that telecom companies knew that it was unlawful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is a fig leaf granting blanket immunity to the telecom companies for possibly illegal acts without allowing the courts to consider the facts or the law. It denies people whose rights are violated their fair day in court, and it denies the American people the right to have the actions of this administration subjected to fair and independent scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even the court's limited review will remain secret. The lawsuits will be dismissed, but the basis for that dismissal that the defendants were innocent of misconduct or that they were guilty, but that Congress commands their immunity, must remain secret.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The constitutionality of the immunity granted by this bill is very questionable. As Judge Walker put it in the AT&amp;T case, "AT&amp;T's alleged actions here violate the constitutional rights clearly established in the Keith decision. Moreover, because the very action in question has previously been held unlawful, AT&amp;T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that the courts will find that because the constitutional rights of Americans have been violated, Congress' attempt to prevent court review is unconstitutional. I regret we may today abandon the Constitution's protections and insulate lawless behavior from legal scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "no" vote on this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400434" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in December of 2005, I was walking to work and was at 1st and C Street when the front page of the New York Times revealed the existence of a program that had not been previously briefed to the entire Intelligence Committee and to the subcommittee that I, at that time, chaired that oversaw the activities of the National Security Agency. That launched a period of extensive oversight and draft legislation in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January of 2007, because legislation didn't pass, the administration made an attempt to put this entire program under a FISA law that was not designed and was not updated. I described that at the time as trying to put a twin-size sheet on a king-size bed. It didn't work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By late summer of 2007, we had lost close to two-thirds of our intelligence collection on terrorism. We were unable to respond fast enough when we had problems, particularly in war zones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just before Memorial Day in 2007, we had three soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq. We needed an Army of lawyers in Washington D.C. to listen to the communications of the people that we thought had kidnapped them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That delay is not good enough and led to the insistence that we pass the Protect America Act, which this Congress did, over the objections of the Democratic leadership, in August of 2007. The Protect America Act closed an important intelligence gap, but it expired in February of this year, and the gap is at risk of ever widening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we pass today will protect the civil liberties of Americans and continue to require individualized warrants for anyone in the United States or American citizens anywhere in the world. It will also allow our intelligence agencies to very rapidly follow up on tips and listen to foreigners in foreign countries who are trying to kill Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have restored FISA to its original intent and modernized it for 21st century communications and technology. This is an important step for our intelligence community and will put it on a sound footing for the next several decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Intelligence, good intelligence, is the first line of defense against terrorism, and today this body will take the next step in making sure we have the tools to be able to listen to our enemies and prevent other terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to support the legislation.</paragraph>

Today I rise in enormous opposition to <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> because, frankly, Madam Speaker, it's very difficult to put lipstick on a pig.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have here is the opportunity for the government to conduct mass, untargeted surveillance of all communications coming into and out of the United States without any individual review and without any finding of wrongdoing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Americans don't know is that this government can now surveil you for 7 days without any approval. Then if the court denies the application, while the application is being appealed from the denial, you can be surveilled for 60 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not constitutional protection. As it relates to the idea of those who are now in court on warrantless searches, now the courts have no authority over that, and your cases will be dismissed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to oppose this because "significant purpose" has been taken out of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, the "FISA Amendments Act of 2008". This body has worked diligently with our colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the civil liberties of American citizens are appropriately addressed. Sadly, this compromise bill falls short of that aim. I will support no bill that fails to protect American civil liberties, both at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am unable to support this bill that will overhaul how the Government monitors foreign terrorist suspects. I will not support any legislation that grants legal immunity to telecommunications companies that provide information to Federal investigators without a warrant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this administration has the law to protect the American people. When Americans are involved, the Bill of Rights, the fourth amendment, and our civil liberties must be adhered to. This legislation does not go far enough to ensure that American rights are protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original legislation offered by the House Majority gave the Administration everything that it needed, but today, after months of negotiation, if we endorse <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, which grants sweeping wiretapping authority to the Government with little court oversight and ensures the dismissal of all pending cases against the telecommunications companies, we are eviscerating the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me explain my objections to <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>. It permits the Government to conduct mass, untargeted surveillance of all communications coming into and out of the United States, without any individualized review, and without any finding of wrongdoing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> permits minimal court oversight. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) only reviews general procedures for targeting and minimizing the use of information that is collected. Under these circumstances, the court may not know what will be tapped and where it will occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the bill contains a general ban on reverse targeting, but not the strong language I worked so diligently to include in the FISA legislation that had passed previously in the House. In my view, the RESTORE Act is far superior to this piece of legislation. I wish to take a few moments to discuss the improvement that I offered to the RESTORE Act in the full Judiciary Committee markup, and which was sent over to the Senate for consideration last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment made an essential contribution to the RESTORE Act by laying down a clear, objective criterion for the administration to follow and the FISA court to enforce in preventing reverse targeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverse targeting is the practice where the Government targets foreigners without a warrant while its actual purpose is to collect information on certain U.S. persons. My language included clear statutory directives regarding whom the government should return to the FISA court and obtain an individualized order if it would like to continue listening to an Americans' communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the major concerns that libertarians and classical conservatives, as well as progressives and civil liberties organizations, have with this legislation, as they did with its successor, the Protect America Act, is that the temptation of national security agencies to engage in reverse targeting may be difficult to resist in the absence of certain safeguards in the law to prevent it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment attempted to produce such safeguards. My amendment reduced even further any such temptation to resort to reverse targeting by requiring the administration to obtain a regular, individualized FISA warrant whenever the "real" target of the surveillance is a person in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment achieved this objective by requiring the administration to obtain a regular FISA warrant whenever a "significant purpose of an acquisition is to acquire the communications of a specific person reasonably believed to be located in the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is far from clear how the operative language "reasonably designed to ensure that any acquisition authorized ..... is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States; and prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes. It is true that <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, the compromise legislation, attempts to ensure that American civil liberties are protected, but the operative language in the legislation does not provide a paradigm for consistency. This is so because it does not provide an objective criterion. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> does not go as far as the legislation that the House sent over to the Senate a few months ago. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> does not retain the objective standards contained in my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language used in my amendment, "significant purpose," is a term of art that long has been a staple of FISA jurisprudence and thus is well known and readily applied by agencies, legal practitioners, and the FISA Court. Thus, the Jackson-Lee amendment provided a clearer, more objective criterion for the administration to follow and the FISA court to enforce to prevent the practice of reverse targeting without a warrant, which all of us can agree should not be permitted.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H5764]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A FISA order should be required in those instances where there is a particular, known person in the United States at the other end of the foreign target's call in whom the Government has a significant interest</paragraph>
    <paragraph>such that a significant purpose of the surveillance has become to acquire that person's communications. This protection has been stripped from <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>. I fought hard to keep this language in the bill because it is important to me; and it should be very important to members of this body and to all Americans. It is important that we require what should be required in all cases--warrant any time there is specific, targeted surveillance of a United States citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have more objections to <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> which I will quickly note. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> contains an "exigent" circumstances loophole that thwarts the judicial review requirement. The bill permits the Government to start a spying program and wait to go to court for up to seven (7) days every time "intelligence important to the national security of the U.S. may be lost or not timely acquired." The problem with <bill type="h" number="6034">H.R. 6034</bill> is that court applications take time and will delay the collection of information.  Therefore, it is possible that there will not be resort to prior judicial review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, the Government is permitted to continue surveillance programs even if the application is denied by the court. The Government has the authority to wiretap through the entire appeals process, and then keep and use whatever it gathers in the meantime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also troubled by <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>'s dismissal of all cases pending against telecommunication companies that facilitated the warrantless wiretapping program over the last 7 years. The test in the bill is not whether the Government certifications were actually legal--only whether they were issued. Because it is public knowledge that they were, all the cases seeking to find out what these companies and the Government did without communications will be dismissed. Under this bill, we will start as a  tabula rasa. Telecommunications companies will be prevented from having their day in court and we, the American people, will never have a chance to know what the companies did and what information is collected. I am deeply troubled by this, and frankly, you should be, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is important to point out that the loudest demands for blanket immunity did not come from the telecommunications companies but from the administration, which raises the interesting question of whether the administration's real motivation is to shield from public disclosure the ways and means by which Government officials may have "persuaded" telecommunications companies to assist in its warrantless surveillance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me be clear in my opposition. Nothing in the Act or the amendments to the Act should require the Government to obtain a FISA order for every overseas target on the off chance that they might pick up a call into or from the United States. Rather, what should be required, is a FISA order only where there is a particular, known person in the United States at the other end of the foreign target's calls in whom the Government has a significant interest such that a significant purpose  of the surveillance has become to acquire that person's communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly two centuries ago, Alexis de Tocqueville, who remains the most astute student of American democracy, observed that the reason democracies invariably prevail in any martial conflict is because democracy is the governmental form that best rewards and encourages those traits that are indispensable to martial success: initiative, innovation, resourcefulness, and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I wrote in the Politico, "the best way to win the war on terror is to remain true to our democratic traditions. If it retains its democratic character, no nation and no loose confederation of international villains will defeat the United States in the pursuit of its vital interests."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, the way forward to victory in the war on terror is for the United States country to redouble its commitment to the Bill of Rights and the democratic values which every American will risk his or her life to defend. It is only by preserving our attachment to these cherished values that America will remain forever the home of the free, the land of the brave, and the country we love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, FISA has served the Nation well for nearly 30 years, placing electronic surveillance inside the United States for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes on a sound legal footing, and I am far from persuaded that it needs to be jettisoned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I know that FISA as outlined in this bill, <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, attempts to curtail the Bill of Rights and the civil liberties of the American people. I continue to insist upon individual warrants, based upon probable cause, when surveillance is directed at people in the United States. The Attorney General must still be required to submit procedures for international surveillance to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for approval, but the FISA Court should not be allowed to issue a "basket  warrant" without making individual determinations about foreign surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all candor, Madam Speaker, I must restate my firm conviction that when it comes to the track record of this President's warrantless surveillance programs, there is still not enough on the public record about the nature and effectiveness of those programs, or the trustworthiness of this administration, to indicate that they require a blank check from Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration did not comply with its legal obligation under the National Security Act of 1947 to keep the Intelligence Committees "fully and currently informed" of U.S. intelligence activities. Congress cannot continue to rely on incomplete information from the Bush administration or revelations in the media. It must conduct a full and complete inquiry into electronic surveillance in the United States and related domestic activities of the NSA, both those that occur within FISA and  those that occur outside FISA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inquiry must not be limited to the legal questions. It must include the operational details of each program of intelligence surveillance within the United States, including: (1) who the NSA is targeting; (2) how it identifies its targets; (3) the information the program collects and disseminates; and most important (4) whether the program advances national security interests without unduly compromising the privacy rights of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the unprecedented amount of information Americans now transmit electronically and the post-9/11 loosening of regulations governing information sharing, the risk of intercepting and disseminating the communications of ordinary Americans is vastly increased, requiring more precise--not looser--standards, closer oversight, new mechanisms for minimization, and limits on retention of inadvertently intercepted communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposition to <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, as it grants sweeping wiretapping authority to the Government with little court oversight and ensures the dismissal of all pending cases against the telecommunications companies. In my view, this is wrong and unacceptable.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to compliment Mr. Reyes. When this happened 124 days ago when it expired, I realized what a challenge you had. They were asking you to win the Kentucky Derby by entering a donkey in the race. And trying to get all of the folks together to get us to the place where we are today was not short feat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Reyes, I want to thank you both because what this bill does today is reaffirm what we have been saying for the last several years, that the due process of the Constitution, the fourth amendment, is alive and well and protected in this bill. And any rhetoric to the contrary is simply not true. It is fear mongering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For any U.S. citizen who believes that their phones are going to be unceremoniously and injudiciously tapped or listened to is simply wrong, and this bill reaffirms the importance of that fourth amendment and due process for every American citizen every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it also says some very important things. We are going to protect the Good Samaritan law that we have known and developed over the last 200-plus years that if you in good faith help your neighbor or help your country, in good faith you will be protected from damages sought by anyone else. If you stand up and protect the liberties and justice of your country and the lives of your neighbors, you will be protected in this law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, our foreign intelligence service allies have been nervous for 124 days, begging, pleading, cajoling, asking please, step up to the plate and reengage in one of the most important intelligence elements that we have, that the United States shares with our foreign allies to stop suicide bombers, to stop terrorist elements from developing plans and plots to kill their citizens as well as our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill reaffirms all that we said last year and the year before. It reaffirms what we said in the Protect America Act in August of 2007 that it is absolutely important that we step up to the plate and listen to foreign terrorists in foreign lands plotting to kill citizens of our allies and here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate all those who came together today, and urge those with the rhetoric to please stand for your country today, stand for the soldiers in the field who deserve our protection and the protection of the intelligence services, and for every mother and every father, every child in America who looks for a better day tomorrow knowing that we once again have both our eyes and our ears on the problem with terrorism and radical jihadists.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding me time to speak about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the negotiators who brought this bill to the floor bought into the flawed assumptions of the Bush administration that because we live in a dangerous world, we must now redefine the fourth amendment and thus the fundamental relationship between the government and its people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this bill becomes law, it will perhaps be the only lasting legacy of the Bush-Cheney administration's overhaul of national security policy, a congressionally blessed distortion of congressional checks and balances. It permits massive warrantless surveillance in the absence of any standard for defining how communications of innocent Americans will be protected; a fishing expedition approach to intelligence collection that we know will not make Americans more safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Its court review provisions are weak and narrowly defined. I know some of those who negotiated this bill say that some court review is better than no court review. That is only true if the judge's hands aren't tied in the review process. They are in this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>You know, Madam Speaker, elections matter. The current balance in the House and the Senate played an important part in the administration, House Republicans, House Democrats, Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans coming together and figuring out what was needed, what was constitutional, in a very much bipartisan fashion.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as some say on radio, "Now let's hear the rest of the story." After the arguments just made on this floor, this is actually a great day. We and the American people have been waiting for this since 12:01 a.m. on February 6 when the Protect America Act expired. During the intervening time we have actually been unnecessarily vulnerable to those who would do us harm in this era of worldwide terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Madam Speaker, I would say that this is the single most important bill we will vote on this year, not that I say supporting our troops is not important, but the intelligence that we gather as the result of the authority granted by this bill may actually create conditions under which we do not have to send troops anywhere in the world and may be more protective of our rights than any other single thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having come before this body on five different occasions since that initial expiration of the Protect America Act, I am greatly relieved that we can finally send the intelligence community and the American people a bill which will enable the intelligence community to continue to protect those American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the compromise agreement embodied in the proposal before us is not necessarily the one I would have written, it does, in my estimation, meet our responsibilities for protecting the American people. In other words, Madam Speaker, it is not the Mona Lisa but it is not a bad paint job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, the proposal before us ensures that we will continue to have the ability to monitor the conversations of al Qaeda overseas. And although there are requirements that the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence adopt procedures which will be submitted to the FISA Court, the bill retains sufficient flexibility for our overseas intelligence mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, the intelligence community leadership has assured us that this bill will allow them the operational authority to do what needs to be done within the parameters of the Constitution. Both the safety of the American people as well as their civil liberties are protected in this proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal embodies compromise language which responds to the legitimate concerns of telecommunication providers who themselves responded to the call of their government in the wake of 9/11. The language of the bill not only satisfies the interest of justice, but communicates loudly to all Americans that if they are ever confronted with such requests, lawful requests, their government will not hang them out to dry afterwards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, a Good Samaritan safe harbor will exist with respect to any civil action where there is substantial evidence to support the certification provided by the Attorney General. The quantum of evidence required is merely a showing of more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance of evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And although these provisions in the proposal will contribute to securing the safety of our citizens, this is not to suggest that I support every provision in the compromise.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>For example, the so-called "exclusive means" language in the bill is seen by some as an assertion of maximal congressional authority.

The court stated that "we take for granted that the President does have that authority."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So regardless of whether we have a President McCain or a President Obama, this language will likely be interpreted in the context of facts in individual cases in light of the constitutional jurisprudence which has arisen with regard to the collection of foreign intelligence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Though not a perfect piece of legislation, it is clearly far better than what we have today, and addresses a number of the many concerns that were raised about the administration's conduct of surveillance in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I know that we must give our Intelligence Community the proper tools to protect us, while upholding the civil liberties of Americans. Today's compromise illustrates what this House can do when it deliberates with care, holds steady against fear mongering and acts in the best interests of the country and its citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is strong on civil liberties, and includes protections against infringement of our constitutional right to privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill clarifies that FISA is the exclusive means by which the executive branch may conduct electronic surveillance on U.S. soil. No President will have the power to do an end-run around the legal requirements of FISA. This provision will prevent the types of abuses we've witnessed under this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this act requires a warrant from the FISA court to conduct surveillance of Americans abroad. Americans will no longer leave their constitutional protections at home when working, studying or traveling abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it requires prior approval by the FISA court of procedures the government will use when carrying out foreign electronic surveillance. This will ensure that the government's efforts are not aimed at targeting Americans, the so-called reverse targeting that we're all concerned about; and that if an American's communications is inadvertently intercepted, it is dealt with in a manner that guarantees legal protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also requires and allows for, now, an IG investigation of this warrantless surveillance program that took place prior to Congress being made aware of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in just 1 minute it's impossible to assure the American people of everything this bill will do. But I would like too, if you will, react to something that was said on the other side that just simply isn't true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, during J. Edgar Hoover's day, there was warrantless surveillance, even on political enemies of the people who were President at the time. Those days are behind us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act, long since we've taken care of domestic wiretap, but this goes one step further. It insures Americans and  particularly, I think, Arab Americans like myself who might go back and forth between here or have relatives in the Middle East, that their conversations will not be the subject of warrantless wiretaps, that, in fact, they can be very confident that America is going to observe the Constitution for them, both when they are here and if they  are visiting abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it's not easy to undo some of the statements that talk about the past, but the truth is, this will protect what has already been established for Americans here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman that has more measures in the Judiciary Committee than anybody else in Congress, Dennis Kucinich, the distinguished gentleman from Ohio, 1 minute.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Under this bill, large corporations and big government can work together to violate the United States Constitution, use massive databases to spy, to wiretap, to invade the privacy of the American people. There's no requirement for the government to seek a warrant for any intercepted communication that includes a U.S. citizen, as long as the program in general is directed towards foreign targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress must not allow the names of innocent U.S. citizens to be placed on secret intelligence lists. Under this bill, violations of Fourth Amendment rights and blanket wiretaps will be permissible for the next 4 years. Massive and untargeted collection of communications will continue and with the enactment of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, it allows the type of surveillance to be applied to all communications entering and exiting the United States. These blanket wiretaps make it impossible to know whose calls are being intercepted by the National Security Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's stand up for the fourth amendment. Let's remember, when this country was founded Benjamin Franklin said, those who would give up their essential liberties to achieve a measure of security deserve neither. Vote against it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> may well be one of the most important pieces of legislation we pass this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 4 months America has been more vulnerable to attacks by our enemies, because of the refusal by some to bring a commonsense bill to the floor to help the Intelligence Community protect Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us would have preferred the bill passed by the Senate. Although this bill may not be ideal, it does represent a compromise between House and Senate Republicans and Democrats. This compromise preserves our ability to conduct a strong, effective foreign intelligence program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to our esteemed Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his great leadership as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. I commend him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Mr. Conyers, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for although he is not supporting the legislation before us today, he certainly had a tremendous impact to improve it. Thank you for your relentless championing of civil liberties in our country, Mr. Conyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to pay special tribute to our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, for making this compromise possible today. It's a very difficult task, many competing views as to how we should go forward. Mr. Hoyer handled it all with great intellect and great respect for all of those views. Thank you, Mr. Hoyer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also want to acknowledge Mr. Smith and Mr. Hoekstra and minority whip, Mr. Blunt, for their leadership in giving us this opportunity today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've heard it over and over again. Our colleagues say this bill is not perfect, this isn't the bill I would write. I prefer this bill, I prefer that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I prefer the House bill that passed and was sent to the Senate. It isn't an option for us. I do not, I totally reject the Senate bill which is an option, and that is the comparison that we have to make, the contrast that we have to make today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in doing so, I think we all understand the important responsibility that we have in this Congress, focused on this debate today. I always take the debate back to our responsibility when we take the oath of office. We take an oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. In that preamble to our Constitution, we must provide for the common defense. Essential to honoring that commitment to protect the American people is to have the intelligence,  operational intelligence that will help us do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first went on the Intelligence Committee, our focus was on force protection. Our troops in the field depend on timely and reliable intelligence to make the decisions necessary to keep them safe and to do their job. Force protection, force protection, force protection. It is still a primary responsibility of our intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, we have the fight on the war against terrorism, the fight against terrorism, wherever it may exist. Good intelligence is necessary for us to know the plans of the terrorists and to defeat those plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we can't go without a bill. That's just simply not an option. But to have a bill, we must have a bill that does not violate the Constitution of the United States, and this bill does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some in the press have said that under this legislation, this bill would allow warrantless surveillance of Americans. That is not true. This bill does not allow warrantless surveillance of Americans. I just think we have to stipulate to some set of facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may have our opinions about the bill, but there have been so many versions of the story of different bills that have come up, the PAA last year, which I thought was totally unacceptable. The Senate bill, also unacceptable. Our House bill, which I mentioned before, which I thought was the appropriate way to go, and now this compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I was talking with Mr. Hoyer in the course of his negotiations, there were certain things that I thought had to be in the bill to make it acceptable, certain threshold issues that had to be there, and they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of the original FISA bill, it's interesting to note that this bill is an improvement on that in three important ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we all recognize the changes in technology necessitate a change in the legislation, and this legislation today modernizes our intelligence-gathering system by recognizing and responding to technological developments that have occurred since the original FISA Act in 1978. In doing so, we can make the country safer in a more advanced technological way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, and this is very, very important, and there's some misunderstanding about this. This bill provides that Americans overseas receive the same FISA protection, including an individualized warrant based on probable cause, as Americans living within the country. This is a very important improvement on the original FISA Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this bill strengthens congressional oversight. And this is very important, the transparency. Transparency and intelligence don't always go together, but accountability is central to intelligence. This strengthens congressional oversight by requiring that the executive branch provide more extensive information about the conduct of surveillance to both the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee. This is new, this is better. The more we know, the better, I think, the law will  be enforced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this bill does not pass, we will most certainly be left with the Senate bill. I think that's clear. And this bill is an improvement over the Senate bill in the following ways, just to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, it reaffirms that FISA is the exclusive means of collecting foreign intelligence, and makes absolutely clear that the enactment of an authorization for the use of force does not give the President, whoever he may be, any inherent authority to alter the requirements of FISA. Very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important because President Bush believed, and this was what we were told, that he, as President of the United States, had inherent authority under the Constitution to do almost anything he wanted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what this bill reaffirms is that the FISA law is the authority for collecting foreign intelligence. There is no inherent authority of the President to do whatever he wants. This is a democracy. It is not a monarchy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it is an improvement of the Senate bill. And by the way, no offense to President Bush. I wouldn't want any President, Democrat or Republican, a Democratic President or a Republican President to have that authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the bill provides that, except in rare circumstances there will be pre-surveillance review by the FISA Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And when I say rare circumstance, I mean very, very rare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike the Senate bill, this legislation retains FISA's broad definition of electronic surveillance and thus guarantees that basic protections of FISA apply to all the new forms of collection authorized by the bill. There had been an attempt, and that's why the Senate bill is inferior in this respect, to just narrow it to certain kinds of collection, and this says it applies to all collection, electronic surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, it contains specific protections against reverse targeting. This reverse targeting is very, very important to the civil liberties of the American people, and I am satisfied by the specific provisions against reverse targeting. It provides a full and independent review of the President's surveillance program by the Inspector General of the relevant agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, there are aspects of this compromise bill that I do not like. I don't believe that Congress should be in the business of interfering with ongoing lawsuits and attempting to grant immunity to telecommunication companies that allegedly violated the law. Those companies have not lived up to a standard expected by the American people. I don't think today is any cause for celebration for them. They come out of this with a taint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not believe that the pending lawsuits would have achieved what we would have liked them to do which is what the Inspector General's review would, which is to learn the truth about the President's terrorist surveillance program and give us the information we need to make sure that never happens again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this legislation makes sure that in the future, the telephone companies must fully comply with Federal statutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it would have been my preference to vote for the RESTORE Act that the House sent over to the Senate. I do not consider it an option to live with the Senate bill. This is the opportunity that we have to protect the American people through the gathering of intelligence which is essential, as I said earlier, to force protection, to protect our men and women in uniform and help them make the decisions they need to do their jobs and keep them safe and to fight terrorists by learning their plans  in advance and squelching them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank those who have worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor. Again, it's not a happy occasion, but it's the work that we have to do. I think we have to remember getting back to the Constitution. The House, article 1, legislates. We pass the laws. The judiciary interprets the law. The executive branch enforces the law. And what is very important about whatever we pass, especially in relating to subjects relating to our security and our liberty, it's important that the President  of the United States enforce this law honoring the Constitution of the United States recognizing the responsibility that we all have to protect the American people and protect the Constitution of the United States at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, a difficult decision for all of us. I respect every opinion that was expressed on this floor today. The knowledge, the sincerity, the passion and the intellect of those who support and oppose this have been very, very valuable in making the bill better, if not good enough for some, but certainly preferable to the alternative that we have which is the Senate bill which must be rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm not asking anybody to vote for this bill. I just wanted you to know why I was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the President, the leaders of Congress, faced a very difficult situation: to learn more and to better understand the threat that America now faced. They recognized that we needed to move from a mentality of being law enforcement to a mentality of prevention, that we needed to confront, contain, and ultimately defeat radical jihadists if America was going to stay safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President, the leaders of Congress, many of whom spoke today, huddled together and talked about the various strategies that they could implement to get a better understanding of this organization called al Qaeda, its leaders, its intentions, and its capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Overarching in their discussions were making sure that the Constitution and the rule of law would guide their behaviors. As they considered various alternatives and discussed these, they implemented a terrorist surveillance program using the capabilities that in many cases are unique to America that could give us insights into al Qaeda, its leadership, and its intentions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not the President's program. This program was put together by the President in consultation, sure, with members of his cabinet, but also, very importantly, with consultation on a bipartisan basis with the leaders of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These leaders in Congress were consistently briefed about how the program would work, the kinds of information that was being obtained, and how it was being used to keep America safe, all the while placing a responsibility on yes, the President, but also the leaders of Congress to make sure that the intel community was doing the things it was being asked and was being asked to do things that would be legal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intel community has performed very well. They have gotten us information that has enabled us to keep America safe. The intel community, this administration, and Congress asked other parts of our economy to participate, private sector companies. They stood up and they did the job to keep America safe. Congress did the necessary job of doing oversight, and in 2004, we reformed the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So since 9/11, many things have been done properly. The end result, as we've gone through this process, is that we have kept America safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Speaker, I congratulate the majority leader, I congratulate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Smith, for working in a bipartisan basis to recognize what needed to be done in allowing this bill to come to the floor and continue to move forward in a slightly different way than how we've been moving forward over the last 6 years. But the most important thing is in a bipartisan basis, we have come together on a national security issue to give our intelligence  community the tools that they need to keep America safe.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Have we forgotten what our ancestors have done in the cause of liberty? Don't we realize there are some lines we can never cross? Don't we realize we should never legitimize illegal violations of America's privacy rights, which this bill does?</paragraph>

Where is the excuse for turning a Nation of laws into a Nation that will be led by a President who knows how to manipulate our fears?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. I thank the Speaker. I thank the Speaker not only for giving me the responsibility for trying to work with some extraordinarily talented people but also for having the courage to lead and the courage to express her convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want, at the outset, to share her view that every Member who has spoken on this floor has spoken out of a sense of conviction and out of a sense of responsibility to the Constitution of the United States and to the protection of our great Nation and our great people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Reyes, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Hoekstra, Mr. Smith have all worked to come together, realizing that there were significant differences. Those four have been assisted by some extraordinary people, and at the outset, I want to mention them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to mention my own staff without whom I think we would not be at this day. She sits on the floor. She worked for my colleague and dear friend Senator Paul Sarbanes for a number of years. One of the benefits of Senator Sarbanes retiring was that she came to my staff. Mariah Sixkiller has expended too much time, perhaps, but with great talent and great ability to reach this day. Thank you, Mariah Sixkiller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Conyers because Chairman Conyers, as you've heard on the floor, has been conflicted but he has been focused on the necessity to respond to issues that are real and also to help us move forward so that we did not, in the minds of many of us, have a bill pass that we thought was unacceptable, a bill passed by the Senate with 68 of 100 votes. We would not be here, in my opinion, without Chairman Conyers' leadership, not because he supports this  alternative, but because he saw the ability to work together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank his staff, Lou DeBaca, Perry Apelbaum. And Lou DeBaca, in particular, who sat for hours and hours and hours in a room trying to reach agreement as we made compromises. Mr. Reyes' staff, Mike Delaney, the staff director. Jeremy Bash. Jeremy Bash did extraordinary work. Jeremy Bash was hired by the former Chair of the Intelligence Committee, Jane Harman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jane Harman is probably as knowledgeable as almost anybody on this floor, other than perhaps the Speaker who served on the Intelligence Committee longer than anybody in this House. Jane Harman's leadership, concern, focus on constitutional rights, focus on the security of our country, was outstanding. She played a significant role in trying to get us to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Eric Greenwald of Mr. Reyes' staff also played a significant role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without Mike Sheehy and Joe Onek of the Speaker's staff, we would not be here today. We would not have reached the good compromises that we reached. Joe Onek and Mike Sheehy, if they were writing this bill, would have written a different bill, much closer to what we passed on our side of the aisle and sent to the Senate, which they rejected. Mike Sheehy has served the House and the Speaker for a very long time in the intelligence field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Senator Rockefeller. We would not be here today on this floor if it were not for Senator Rockefeller. Senator Rockefeller very early on had discussions with me about what could they do to try to move towards the bill that we passed. He made some suggestions. Those suggestions are in this bill today. He facilitated our actions. Andy Johnson, Mike Davidson, Alissa Starzak of his staff were very, very helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bond, Senator Bond and I did not see necessarily eye-to-eye on these issues as we began, but at the end, we came to an agreement. Louis Tucker and Jack Livinston of his staff were very helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Hoekstra, or former Chairman Hoekstra, now Ranking Member Hoekstra, I want to thank Chairman Hoekstra, but particularly, I want to thank Chris Donessa who was very helpful, gave us great assistance and advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lamar Smith and Caroline Lynch of his staff, thank you very much for your efforts as you sat in that room, as we all sat around, every one of the committees sat around the table, as we came to the final agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I want to thank, of course, Jen Stewart and the minority leader, without whom we could not have gotten to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I want to thank my friend. There's an article going to be written. It's going to speculate whether or not he and I hurt one another by saying the other is his friend. I don't think that's the case. I said that Roy Blunt and I often disagree on substantive issues, but what we agree on very strongly is that this House needs to sit down and talk to one another and try to reach resolution on difficult issues, not hard-to-reach compromise on easy issues. It's on the difficult issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Roy Blunt is a man of this House, who cares about this House, who cares about this country. And he cares about drafting legislation that can be agreed upon by a broad section of this House and the American people. He has an extraordinary staff of Brian Diffell, who I want to thank for his efforts, but in particular, I want to thank Roy Blunt for his friendship, for his integrity, and for his willingness to take risks to reach compromise. Thank you, Roy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we conclude one step in a long, continuing process. Just under a year ago, the House came under great pressure from the administration and the Senate to pass the Protect America Act, a bill I could not support and spoke out against for its lack of civil liberties protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, there have been other attempts to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: first, the RESTORE Act passed by the House last November with my strong support, with Mr. Conyers' strong support, Mr. Reyes' strong support, and the support of this House; that was followed by the Senate bill which passed, as I said earlier, with 68 votes in February; and most recently, the FISA Amendments Act, passed by the House last March. I supported that bill as well. I think  it was a better bill. It would be my alternative. It was our alternative on this side of the aisle, but it was not the consensus alternative, and we needed to reach consensus to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to support the two House bills, which I believe struck the right balance between giving our intelligence community the tools to go after those who seek to harm and protecting the constitutional rights of American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I stand in support of a different kind of bill, a compromise. To be clear, this is not the bill that I would have written or that perhaps anybody individually on this floor would have written. However, in our legislative process, no one gets everything he or she wants. Different parties, often with deeply competing interests, come together here to produce a consensus product, where each side gives and takes. I don't believe we've given on the ultimate principles on either side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few months, I've been involved in almost daily discussions with the stakeholders on this important issue, Members in both Chambers, in both parties, as well as outside organizations and experts. I want to thank all of the outside organizations, whether they agree with our product or do not. Their contribution has been an important one. I particularly want to thank those who take very unpopular  positions to protect the rights of perhaps  just one of us among the 300 million, who in the land of the free and the home of the brave deserve to have that one individual right protected, and I appreciate their efforts to ensure that that country remains that kind of country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, we have worked to develop a bill that strikes a sound balance. This measure provides the intelligence community with the strong authority to surveil foreign terrorists who seek to harm this country and our people. As the Speaker said, that is our responsibility, and we intend to meet it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides for enhanced civil liberties protections for Americans and insists on meaningful judicial scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It includes critical new oversight and accountability requirements that both address the President's warrantless surveillance program and ensures that any surveillance going forward comports with the fourth amendment and will be closely monitored by the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of vital importance, my colleagues, this legislation makes clear that FISA is the exclusive means by which the government may conduct surveillance, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Contrary to the administration's previous actions, in which it did not comply with the FISA statute, this statute makes it very clear, this and this alone is the process through which we will intercept communications, an issue of great importance to the Speaker, as she has said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notably, this bill does not address or excuse any actions by the government or government officials related to the President's warrantless surveillance program, nor does it include any statement by the Congress or conclusion on the legality of that program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, it mandates for the first time ever a robust accounting by the Inspectors General of the warrantless surveillance program, which Congress will receive and act on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in closing, let me say again, this bill is a compromise, but in my opinion, it is a compromise worth supporting. And the conclusions drawn by editorials in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post over the last 2 days reflect this compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, for example, the Washington Post recognized that this is a reasonable effort to strike a compromise, stating: "Striking the balance between liberties and security is never easy, and the new FISA bill is not perfect. But it is a vast improvement over the original law and over the earlier, rushed attempts to revise that law."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said at the beginning, this bill is one step in a long, continuing process of updating this critical legislation, ensuring that our national security and our civil liberties are both protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation sunsets at the end of 2012, and it's imperative that we scrutinize its implementation in the future and make any necessary changes. I believe we have the best bill before us that we could possibly get in the current environment. It is a significant improvement over the Senate-passed bill and, I suggest, existing law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues in the years ahead to ensure that both our national security and our civil liberties are protected. That is our responsibility. That is our pledge to our constituents. I urge passage of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on March 14th I voted in favor of <bill type="h" number="3773">H.R. 3773</bill> which modernized the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This bill successfully updated the law to accommodate the current day communications technology while at the same time providing the much-needed protection of the court in sanctioning the surveillance of Americans. Moreover, the bill was also remarkable for what it did not contain; it did not provide retroactive immunity for telephone companies who are defendants  in pending lawsuits. These suits have been brought to uncover the full extent of the Administration's program to conduct unauthorized surveillance on Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply troubled that the Senate does not have the votes to pass the House bill. The Senate instead passed its own bill, <bill type="s" number="2248">S. 2248</bill>, which was unacceptable to me from the outset because it reduced the role of the FISA Court to merely review the procedures for targeting surveillance subjects and minimizing the information collected. Moreover, the Senate bill established retroactive immunity for the phone companies that have been used to carry out the Administration's illicit surveillance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be sure, the Senate bill is completely unacceptable. Majority Leader Hoyer worked tirelessly to improve upon the Senate bill to forge an acceptable compromise. The bill before us today, however, does not go far enough to include sufficient safeguards of court involvement in the surveillance of Americans. Moreover, it continues to provide retroactive immunity for those companies that carried out the Administration's unauthorized surveillance. Finally, it fails to hold the Administration  accountable for its past illicit surveillance activities and its disregard of the Fourth Amendment protections of Americans. As a result, I must vote against this bill.</paragraph>

The proposed FISA law protects no one other than the administration and those within it who may use this new-found power to snoop and spy in areas where they have no business looking. We are giving broad new powers to political appointees who have repeatedly disregarded the Constitution and ignored the most basic rights of Americans to live their lives without Big Brother peeking his nose  into their private matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This FISA bill gives the federal government sweeping powers to gather wide swaths of information from foreign sources while providing little or no justification for the national security value of that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FISA Court set up to police the process isn't a court at all. Under this bill, the government can gather as much intelligence as it chooses for seven days prior to going to the court. Then, if the court says "No" to the request, the government can continue to gather intelligence for 60 days while they appeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any first year law student knows that is not how courts work. If this were a real court, the government would be required to abide by the decision of the court and seek the warrant prior to conducting surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fundamentally untrue to say that Americans will not be placed under surveillance after this bill becomes law. The truth is, any American will subject their phone and e-mail conversations to the broad government surveillance web simply by calling a son or daughter studying abroad, sending an e-mail to a foreign relative, even calling an American company whose customer service center is located overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, our government puts a feel-good name on something that doesn't live up to its billing. Calling the FISA rubber stamp panel a court is akin to the President's "Clear Skies Initiative" which relaxed pollution regulations or "No Child Left Behind" which instead of helping schools, punishes them if they have children who are, indeed, lagging behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill sets out to reassure Americans that, because there are warrants and a "court", due process is taking place. But like the pseudo-court, FISA warrants aren't warrants at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A warrant is permission by the court to look for a specific thing from a specific person or group for a specific reason. The FISA warrant is given after the fact and can be as broad as gathering all electronic communication coming into or out of a foreign country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, America isn't simply `guided" by our Constitution, it isn't a set of "suggestions" but rather, the law of the land. It is the existence of this great document and our unswerving loyalty to it that makes America the greatest nation in the history of our planet. We can't be sacrificing basic constitutional principles like the fourth amendment simply because it's an election year and we want to make it look like we're fighting terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my colleagues in our unified fight to defeat the global terrorist movement. But we don't do that by sacrificing our hard-earned Constitutional rights and forgiving telephone companies who knowingly violate those rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, this FISA bill permits the collection of Americans' emails and phone calls if they are communicating with someone outside of the U.S. This is especially true when it comes to emails, because the World Wide Web has no area codes, so it is impossible to tell where email communications originate from. The Government is under no obligation to seek a warrant in order to monitor an email account unless it knows the account belongs to an American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And once your email account is swept up in the system, it can be monitored. Regardless of the relevance of your personal information, once it is gathered by the government, it is never destroyed. One only has to recall the recent incident in the State Department where candidates' passport information was breached to know that this information isn't  handled by robots, but people. And people can do any number of things with personal informations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Out of respect to the United States Constitution and the basic rights of Americans to live free of intrusive eavesdropping by their government, I strongly oppose <bill type="h" number="6034">HR 6034</bill>, the FISA Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker; first I want to commend the Chairman and the Majority leader for the work they've done to bring this legislation to the floor of the House. It has been a challenge for all of us on the Intelligence Committee and in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a vast improvement over the previous law, and indeed over the Protect America Act passed by the House last August which I opposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill very importantly establishes a process for electronic surveillance that includes prior approval by the independent courts, and in some respects, this legislation goes even further than the existing FISA statute or the House-passed RESTORE Act in protecting the civil liberties of U.S. persons. Under this bill the Administration would have to seek a court order before conducting surveillance on U.S. persons abroad. Until now and under the Protect America Act, the executive branch could  conduct electronic surveillance of U.S. persons without prior judicial approval. This legislation also allows the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies to go forward in a limited fashion, which would not have occurred at all under current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said this I must oppose this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the original structure of FISA, telecommunications carriers served an important gate-keeping function. They were not permitted to provide access to private communications in the United States unless the government made a lawful request to conduct surveillance, pursuant to a FISA order. For decades, the government has sought and obtained thousands of FISA warrants prior to beginning surveillance, or in urgent cases shortly thereafter. We all remember the shocking news when the President  had to acknowledge that his Administration created an illegal, warrantless electronic surveillance program outside of the FISA legal framework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would essentially grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications carriers who relied on statements made by this Administration that the program was lawful. However, as we've seen in numerous instances, this Administration pushed new and aggressive interpretations of the law, including in this area. We all recall vividly the days following \9/11\, and the urgency that prevailed, but suspending our laws and allowing the Attorney General to unilaterally issue a "get out of jail  free card" is not appropriate under any circumstances. There should be at least some minimal inquiry into whether the telecommunications carriers reliance on the statements made by this Administration was reasonable. If so, the they would be able to assert their existing statutory immunity defenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout our Nation's history, the judiciary has been the most important check on an overzealous executive, and it is often through the judicial process that we uncover and remedy some of the most egregious executive misconduct. This legislation undermines and effectively nullifies the courts' ability to hold the Administration accountable for its actions, which likely violated the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation was founded on the principle of separation of powers. The executive branch should be subject to independent oversight by the judicial branch. This legislation does not go far enough to allow the judicial branch to conduct an independent, reasoned inquiry into this critical issue. Therefore, I must oppose this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I will support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will do so because, as I have consistently said, I do think the basic law in this area--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA--needs to be updated to respond to changes in technology, which was the purpose of the current, temporary law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why, last August, I voted for a bill (<bill type="h" number="3356">H.R. 3356</bill>) to provide such an update--a bill that was supported by a majority of the House, but did not pass because it was considered under a procedure that required a two-thirds vote for passage, which did not occur because of the opposition of the Bush Administration. It was supported by all but three of our Republican colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is also why I voted for another bill to update FISA--H.R. 3773, the "Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseer, Reviewed, and Effective" (or RESTORE) Act--which the House passed on November 15th of last year. Like those bills I supported earlier, this bill will replace the Protect America Act, enacted in August 2007--which I opposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill makes it very clear that to conduct surveillance targeting a person in the United States, the government first must obtain an individual warrant from the FISA Court, based upon probable cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, importantly, it explicitly states that FISA and Title III of the U.S. criminal code are the exclusive means by which the government may conduct surveillance on American soil, and adds that any future statute must expressly authorize surveillance if the government is going to rely on it to conduct domestic surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also includes new legal protections for Americans abroad, requiring an individual probable cause determination by the FISA Court when the government seeks to conduct surveillance of U.S. persons located outside the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It requires prior review and approval by the FISA Court of the targeting and minimization procedures used to conduct surveillance of any foreign targets (unless in an emergency, in which case the government may authorize the surveillance and then apply to the FISA Court for approval within 7 days), and requires that this surveillance be conducted in accordance with the Fourth Amendment. And it requires the government to establish guidelines to ensure that Americans are not targeted by this surveillance</paragraph>
    <paragraph>targeting guidelines"), and requires the government to provide those reverse targeting guidelines to Congress and the FISA Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also includes important provisions to increase transparency and accountability. For example, it requires there be a comprehensive review of the President's warrantless surveillance program by the Inspectors General of the Justice Department, the Directorate of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, and the Defense Department--and it provides for them to report the results to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This report will review "all of the facts necessary to describe the establishment, implementation, product, and use of the Program," as well as "communications with, and participation of, individuals and entities in the private sector related to the Program."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not find equally satisfactory another aspect of the bill that involves accountability--the treatment of pending lawsuits against various telecommunication companies that acted to implement President Bush's clandestine surveillance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the bills I supported earlier, this measure would provide civil liability protection for private sector companies that provide lawful assistance to the government in the future. But it differs significantly in the way it addresses those pending lawsuits, which deal with the previous actions of the defendant companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those lawsuits have been consolidated and are pending in one court, but evidently have made little progress because of the Administration's argument, still awaiting court resolution, that the suits are barred because they involve state secrets. My understanding is that the defendant companies have argued that government's invocation of the state-secrets privilege has had the result of preventing them from defending themselves, although at least one company has stated in regulatory filings that  the cases against it are without merit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has insisted that Congress throw these cases out of court by giving the companies retroactive immunity for whatever they might have done in connection with the surveillance program, even though the Administration and the companies themselves insist that those actions were lawful and that the plaintiffs' complaints against the companies have no merit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the Senate decided to comply with the president's demand on this point, and its version of this legislation would provide that retroactive immunity. I do not think that was the right decision because I agree with the Rocky Mountain News, which in a February 15th editorial said "Letting this litigation proceed would not, as Bush [has] said .....punish companies that want to `help America.' Businesses that want to help America need to be mindful of the Constitution--and so should  the government."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported removing that "state secret" barrier and allowing the companies to defend themselves by demonstrating to the court the evidence they say supports their arguments in a way that assures the continued security of that evidence and that avoids the public disclosure the Administration says would be adverse to the national interest. This is a process that has worked well in criminal cases, and while I am certainly not an expert on the matter, I think it can work when applied to these  civil cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that respect, this bill is similar to the legislation I supported earlier this year. But it is not identical, and I do not think it is quite as sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, a district court hearing such a case will decide whether the Attorney General's certification attesting that the liability protection standard has been met and is supported by substantial evidence. In making that determination, the court will have the opportunity to examine the highly classified letters to the providers that indicated the President had authorized the activity and that it had been determined to be lawful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not as strong a requirement for accountability as I would prefer. However, in such cases both plaintiffs and defendants will have the opportunity to file public briefs on legal issues and the court should include in any public order a description of the legal standards that govern the order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, importantly, this immunity provision does not apply to any actions against the Government for any alleged injuries caused by government officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as Benjamin Franklin has warned us, people who value security over liberty will get neither--and the Bush Administration has finally agreed to end its disregard for liberty and agree to effective judicial oversight and involvement in intelligence surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That agreement that is embodied in this bill, and the choice before us now is whether to reject it or to support the compromise measure now before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After careful review, I have concluded that the bill adequately meets the test of protecting civil liberties while giving our country tools needed to effectively combat terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, while--like any compromise--the bill is not ideal, I have decided the correct decision--the one that will fulfill my responsibility to protect both our national security and the civil liberties that make our nation worth defending--is to vote for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, FISA Amendments Act. This bipartisan bill takes steps to increase our Nation's security while also protecting Americans' civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, FISA Amendments Act, provides the critical tools that our intelligence community needs to ensure the safety of our Nation. With many surveillance warrants set to expire in the coming weeks, the intelligence community needs a strong and dependable set of guidelines to follow while conducting surveillance. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> allows the Government to authorize surveillance in the case of an emergency situation, provided that they return to the FISA court within 7 days to apply for a warrant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also includes a number of provisions that significantly strengthen the protection of our civil rights. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> clarifies that FISA is the exclusive means for conducting surveillance in the United States, prohibiting any President from using executive power to conduct a warrantless wiretapping program. This bill also requires the Government to obtain an individual warrant from the FISA Court before conducting surveillance on a United States citizen. This warrant must be based on probable  cause, and the provision now includes American citizens abroad as well. <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> requires prior review and approval of the intelligence community's targeting and minimization procedures that ensure that any inadvertently intercepted communications by American</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill> rejects blanket immunity for telecommunications companies that may have participated in the administration's warrantless wiretapping program. Under this bill, lawsuits against these companies would be determined by Federal district courts. These telecommunications companies will have to prove that the Administration provided written assurance that their activities were legal. There is no immunity for any government official who may have violated the law included in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is much stronger than the Senate version, and will protect both our security and the civil liberties that we enjoy. I support the passage of <bill type="h" number="6304">H.R. 6304</bill>, FISA Amendments Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bipartisan measure as well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400230" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I know we must give our intelligence community the proper tools to protect us while upholding the civil liberties of Americans. Today's compromise illustrates what this House can do when it deliberates with care, holds steady against fear-mongering, and acts in the best interest of the country and its citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is strong on civil liberties, and includes protections against infringement of our Constitutional right to privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill clarifies that FISA is the exclusive means by which the executive branch may conduct electronic surveillance on U.S. soil. No President will have the power to do an end-run around the legal requirements of FISA. This provision will prevent the types of abuses we have witnessed under this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this Act requires a warrant from the FISA court to conduct surveillance of Americans abroad. Americans will no longer leave their constitutional protections at home when working, studying, or traveling abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it requires prior approval by the FISA court of procedures the Government will use when carrying out foreign electronic surveillance. This will ensure that the Government's efforts are not aimed at targeting Americans, and that, if an American's communication is inadvertently intercepted, it is dealt with in a manner that guarantees legal protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One issue that has been repeatedly addressed is whether telecommunications companies should be granted immunity against pending lawsuits for their involvement in the earlier surveillance program. For a long period of time, the Bush Administration stonewalled and did not provide Congress the documents we demanded to ascertain the role that the telecommunications companies played. Since then, I have reviewed a large number of classified documents on this matter, and I am deeply concerned about  the manner in which the Bush administration conducted its surveillance program. Therefore, I am pleased that this legislation preserves a role for the U.S. court system, which will review the documents produced by the White House and other relevant documents to decide independently whether the telecommunications companies acted in good faith when cooperating with the Government. Only after that review would the courts decide whether</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many today have said that the legislation before us is not a perfect bill, and I agree. Nevertheless, it is significantly better than the bill passed by the Senate and an immense improvement over the Bush administration's program, neither of which took sufficient steps to protect Americans' civil liberties. I know that the Democratic leadership negotiated a good compromise, and I will support it. However, as I have said before, this legislation will only work if everyone involved follows the  rules and remains within the confines of the law. Congress must continue to conduct robust oversight to make sure the law is implemented as intended to maintain the critical and fragile balance of protecting our Nation and protecting civil liberties.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill. I appreciate the hard work that Mr. Hoyer and others have done on this legislation. The bill before the House is a vast improvement over the administration's Protect America Act, which I strongly opposed last August. The legislation is also a significant improvement over the seriously flawed FISA legislation approved by the Senate earlier this year. In many respects, the bill before the House strikes a reasonable balance between  giving the Government the tools it needs to protect U.S. national security and protecting Americans' constitutional rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I am pleased that the bill reaffirms that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive legal means by which the Government may conduct surveillance. This stands in stark contrast to the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program. I also support the provisions of this bill that protect Americans traveling abroad. They need no longer leave their constitutional protections at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, I oppose this bill because of the provisions that would confer retroactive immunity on the telecommunications companies that participated in the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program. We are a nation of laws, and it sets a dangerous precedent for Congress to approve a law that dismisses ongoing court cases simply on the basis that the companies can show that the administration told them that its warrantless surveillance program was legal. A program is not  legal just because the administration claims that it is. The retroactive immunity provisions in this bill shield the administration from accountability for its actions. The goal here is not to harm the telecommunications carriers, but rather to get to the truth of what happened. A much better alternative would be to grant indemnification to the companies and go forward with the trials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Irrespective of the outcome of today's vote, we need a full accounting of the administration's surveillance program, and the bill before the House provides for an Inspectors General audit describing all Federal programs involving warrantless surveillance conducted since September 11, 2001. The audit is to be completed within 1 year. Congress must get to the bottom of what happened and prevent it from happening again. It is essential that Congress follow up on the audit's findings with robust  oversight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while l cannot support the legislation before us today, I commend Majority Leader Hoyer for the work he has done to negotiate a bill that is substantially better than the version that passed in the Senate. This legislation, which will be the exclusive mechanism for the Government to conduct surveillance within the United States,  contains provisions that will provide greater protections against unwarranted and unconstitutional  searches of American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the many improvements Mr. Hoyer was able to obtain, I unfortunately still cannot support this legislation because it contains a provision that will grant immunity to the telecommunications companies that assisted the President with his illegal and unauthorized warrantless wiretapping program. I have consistently said that it is not appropriate for Congress to grant these companies immunity for their actions without having an understanding of what it is that they did. This is  not only because it will hold the telecommunications companies accountable for their actions, but because it is the only way of finding out just how extensive the President's illegal wiretapping program really was. In other words, this provision will enable the Bush administration to continue suppressing facts and information about the Government's own misbehavior and wrongdoing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The immunity provision contained in this bill purporting to allow for judicial review to determine whether immunity is appropriate is a sham. As drafted, courts will have no real discretion and will be forced to grant immunity so long as the Government claims its actions were legal. However, the court is under no obligation to investigate whether the Government's claims are true. Anyone following the headlines recently, who has read about the recent Supreme Court decision overturning the administration's  argument that it has the authority to detain people indefinitely in Guantanamo Bay, or about the hearings held by Senator Carl Levin and the Senate Armed Services Committee uncovering evidence that top civilian leadership at the Department of Defense authored memos arguing it was legal for the military to torture detainees, should be extremely wary of trusting President Bush to decide whether or not it is legal to spy on Americans.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>I have consistently supported modernizing the existing FISA law to give our Government the tools it needs to identify and defeat terrorists in today's high-tech world, while at the same time preserving the freedoms and rights that define America. I have voted three times to pass legislation that would strengthen and modernize FISA and reaffirm the rule of law. Despite some improvements over previous attempts to update FISA, the bill considered by the House today regrettably  falls short of achieving that critical balance. The rule of law lies at the core of America's founding principles, and the language in this bill was too weak to ensue that any breach of our laws that may have occurred under the warrantless wiretapping program will be fully addressed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hard work put in by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers. For the past year we've participated in substantial and sometimes heated debate on the issue of surveillance and foreign intelligence. I appreciate the good faith efforts of our leadership, particularly Mr. HOYER, as we try to craft legislation that keeps both our liberties and our persons safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past seven years I have been highly critical of Republican wiretapping legislation. I voted against past efforts to expand this administration's ability to intrude in the lives of unknowing and innocent Americans. I supported the expiration of the disgraceful Protect America Act. And I remain confident that the dedicated members of the intelligence community do not need to violate the rights of Americans in order to protect them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard some say that the enemies of America take on many forms. To them I say: Let us be sure one of those forms is not our own government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately this is a compromise that falls short. Any gains in security that may be achieved are temporary and are more than outweighed by the longer-term loss of civil liberties and oversight. Although this bill is comparatively better than the Senate's version, I am troubled by the lack of robust government oversight, the absence of meaningful court review, and the risk to American liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of particular concern is the granting of de facto retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that cooperated with the administration. A `doctor's note' from the Attorney General cannot be allowed to circumvent the entire judicial process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am equally concerned with the timeline of this bill, and strongly oppose authorizing this legislation for four years. This will extend the Bush legacy throughout the next administration and the next two sessions of Congress. Frankly I see no reason to rush into a compromise that comes up this short. The American people would be better served if we continued to debate this issue and took up a bill after we have seen the last of this administration. Americans demand and deserve protection of  their basic civil rights and this can be accomplished while providing the means necessary for our intelligence community to do its job.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400289" topic="UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED CURRENTNESS">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Members of the House must decide today whether to uphold the rule of low and the supremacy of the Constitution or whether to protect and reward the lawless behavior of the administration and of the telecommunications companies that participated in its clearly illegal program of spying on innocent Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill limits the courts hearing lawsuits alleging illegal wiretapping to consider only whether the telecom companies received a "written request or directive ..... indicating that the activity was [ ] authorized by the President; and [ ] determined to be lawful"--not whether the request was actually lawful or whether the telecom companies knew that it was unlawful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is a fig-leaf, granting blanket immunity to the telecom companies for illegal acts without allowing the courts to consider the facts or the law. It denies people whose rights were violated their fair day in court, and it denies the American people their right to have the actions of the administration subjected to fair and independent scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even the courts' limited review will remain secret. The lawsuits will be dismissed, but the basis for the dismissal--that the defendants were innocent of misconduct, or that they were guilty but Congress commands their immunity--must remain secret.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the constitutionality of the immunity granted by this bill is very questionable. As Judge Walker put it in the AT&amp;T case:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AT&amp;T's alleged actions here violate the constitutional rights clearly established in [the] Keith decision. Moreover, because `the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,' AT&amp;T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that the courts will find that, because the Constitutional rights of Americans have been violated, Congress' attempt to prevent court review is unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also reiterates than FISA and specified other statutes are the exclusive legal authority for electronic surveillance. The Act has always said that. This bill adds some new mechanisms to ensure that any future legislation may not be read to override this exclusivity by implication, but only by explicitly saying that that is its purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one and no court should draw the false conclusion that we are thereby implying that the exclusivity provision was, or could have been, overridden either by the President's claim of inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution, or by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force of 2001. This bill does not say or imply that. If there is any doubt of this point, the blanket immunity provisions of this bill reflect Congress' understanding that this domestic spying was not legal.  If it were, there would not be any necessity for these provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill abandons the Constitution's protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>
