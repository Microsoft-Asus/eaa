  <narrative>JULIA M. CARSON POST OFFICE -- (Senate - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2939">S2939</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Lugar and I honor Congresswoman Julia Carson by urging the Senate to support the legislation, <bill type="s" number="2534">S. 2534</bill>, which will designate a U.S. Post Office in Indianapolis in her name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Postal Service recommended the Mapleton Station Post Office in Indianapolis be the location named in her honor. Congresswoman Carson was not only instrumental in the erection of the new Mapleton Station, which opened its doors at a new location on July 15, 2005, but she also attended the dedication ceremony for the new building on August 11, 2005. This new, attractive building will be a terrific sign of respect for her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Carson was born on July 8, 1938, in Louisville, KY. When she was only 1 year old, Julia and her family moved to Indianapolis. Carson graduated from Crispus Attucks High School in 1955 and attended Martin University in Indianapolis and Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia Carson's political career began when she was working in the Indianapolis office of former Congressman Andy Jacobs, who served 15 terms as the Congressman from Indianapolis, 10th District, Indiana. Jacobs encouraged Carson to run for the Indiana House of Representatives. Elected in 1972, Carson served in the Indiana House of Representatives for 4 years. In 1976, after serving in the Indiana House, Julia Carson successfully ran for a seat in the Indiana Senate, where she continued to serve  Hoosiers for 14 years. In that position, Julia Carson gave unfailing support to Indiana's successful ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and supported legislation to improve women's economic status, such as the bill she advocated to include household workers in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After serving in the Indiana Senate, Carson became a trustee for Center Township of Marion County, an area comprised of downtown Indianapolis, where she instituted aggressive measures to help the city's homeless and trimmed the inflated welfare rolls by imposing new rules that required able-bodied recipients to work or attend school as a condition of receiving poor relief. In 1992, Julia Carson was declared Woman of the Year by the Indianapolis Star for her efforts to improve welfare and create  a fiscal surplus in Marion County. Her dedication to Indianapolis continued to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1996, Andy Jacobson retired from the U.S. House of Representatives, and Carson successfully won his seat, representing what was then Indiana's 10th Congressional District. Representative Julia Carson is only the third woman and second African American to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congresswoman, Julia Carson is best remembered for her leadership awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks for her instrumental role in the civil rights movement. Carson worked closely with Senator Evan Bayh on initiatives to establish a program that would promote more responsible fatherhood by creating educational, economic, and employment opportunities. She also worked with  Senator Richard Lugar to improve children's  health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Congress, Julia Carson served on the Committee of Financial Services, the Subcommittee of Financial Services and Consumer Credit, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Material, and the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit. Carson was also a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout her 10 years in Congress, Julia Carson worked tirelessly for the poor  and forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after announcing her diagnosis with terminal lung cancer, Julia Carson died on December 15, 2007, at age 69. At her funeral service, those who spoke all said Carson, the daughter of an unwed teenage mother who worked as a housekeeper, never forgot where she came from. Therefore, it is only fitting that the Congress designate a post office in the name of Julia M. Carson in her hometown of Indianapolis.</paragraph>
