(a) Findings Regarding Progress in Iraq, the Establishment of Benchmarks to Measure That Progress, and Reports to Congress.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Over 145,000 American military personnel are currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the finest traditions of the United States Armed Forces, and are deserving of the strong support of all Americans.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Many American service personnel have lost their lives, and many more have been wounded in Iraq; the American people will always honor their sacrifice and honor their families.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The United States Army and Marine Corps, including their Reserve components and National Guard organizations, together with components of the other branches of the military, are performing their missions while under enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. These deployments, and those that will follow, will have a lasting impact on future recruiting, retention, and readiness of our Nation's all volunteer force.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of sectarian and intrasectarian violence based upon political distrust and cultural differences among factions of the Sunni and Shia populations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Iraqis must reach political and economic settlements in order to achieve reconciliation, for there is no military solution. The failure of the Iraqis to reach such settlements to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and halting sectarian violence rests with the sovereign Government of Iraq.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy that includes new and enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq, that will enable the United States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The President said on January 10, 2007, that "I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended" so as to dispel the contrary impression that exists.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) It is essential that the sovereign Government of Iraq set out measurable and achievable benchmarks and President Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that "America will change our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet these benchmarks".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) As reported by Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of political, security, and economic benchmarks and an associated timeline in September 2006 that were: (A) reaffirmed by Iraq's Presidency Council on October 6, 2006; (B) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (C) posted on the President of Iraq's Web site.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) On April 21, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that "our [American] commitment to Iraq is long-term, but it is not a commitment to have our young men and women patrolling Iraq's streets open-endedly" and that "progress in reconciliation will be an important element of our evaluation".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) The President's January 10, 2007, address had three components: political, military, and economic. Given that significant time has passed since his statement, and recognizing the overall situation is ever changing, Congress must have timely reports to evaluate and execute its constitutional oversight responsibilities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Conditioning of Future United States Strategy in Iraq on the Iraqi Government'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;s Record of Performance on Its Benchmarks.--&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph> (1) IN GENERAL.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) The United States strategy in Iraq, hereafter, shall be conditioned on the Iraqi government meeting benchmarks, as told to members of Congress by the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected in the Iraqi Government's commitments to the United States, and to the international community, including:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) Forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then completing the constitutional review.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) Enacting and implementing legislation on de-Baathification.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iii) Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable manner.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iv) Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to form semi-autonomous regions.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (v) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an Independent High Electoral Commission, provincial elections law, provincial council authorities, and a date for provincial elections.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS TITLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, more than 4 years ago, the Bush administration took this Nation to war in Iraq--took this Nation to war in Iraq without sufficient troops, without a plan to win the peace, and without truth regarding Saddam Hussein's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction or his nonexistent links to al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 51 months later--6 months longer than it took this Nation to defeat Germany and Japan in World War II--the violence in Iraq continues and the cost to our military and our Nation has been frightening. More than 3,400 American troops have made the ultimate sacrifice--death. Nine were killed yesterday and two more today in this escalating violence across Iraq in which we are losing our brave men and women. Guard and Reserve units all across America lack equipment to do their jobs at home  and in Iraq. U.S. citizens have provided nearly half a trillion dollars to cover the cost of this intractable civil war. And because of this war, our Nation has been totally distracted in its effort to defeat those who attacked us on 9/11. Indeed, more than 5 years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden is still free, and al-Qaida remains an important force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout all this, our military has performed heroically. Our troops have done everything asked of them and even more. Our troops toppled a dictator and gave the Iraqis a chance to establish a new government and a new way of life. Unfortunately, the Bush administration did not provide them a strategy to match that sacrifice. Iraq is now in a state of civil war, with no end in sight, and our valiant troops are caught in the middle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of accepting this reality, President Bush has stubbornly refused to change course. Instead of listening to his military commanders who say there is no military solution in Iraq, he has plunged our forces further into sectarian fighting. Instead of accepting a bipartisan path in Iraq offered by Congress and even the Iraq Study Group, this President stubbornly clings to his failed "my way or the highway" approach to governing America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MG John Batiste, who commanded the First Infantry Division in Iraq, says this about the President's failed Iraq policy:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the bottom line: Americans must come to grips with the fact that our military alone cannot establish a democracy. We cannot sustain the current operational tempo without seriously damaging the Army and Marine Corps. Our troops have been asked to carry the burden of an ill-conceived mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said: The problems in Iraq are more complex than Vietnam, and military victory is no longer possible. Henry Kissinger said--and I repeat--the problems in Iraq are more complex than Vietnam, and military victory is no longer possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GEN George Casey, former Commander of U.S. Forces in Iraq, and currently Chief of Staff of the Army, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has always been my view that a heavy and sustained military presence was not going to solve the problem in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was General Casey. Six months ago, the Iraq Study Group said the situation in Iraq was grave and deteriorating. The civil war in Iraq has only gotten more pronounced since then. Unfortunately, the President's escalation strategy has not produced the positive results we seek. Attacks on U.S. forces have increased, not decreased. Since the onset of this latest surge, more than three U.S. soldiers have been killed every day. Nearly 90 soldiers have been killed this month so far, and almost  400 since the escalation plan began. Sectarian killings have increased to presurge levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to today's Washington Post newspaper, over 300 unidentified corpses, most dumped in streets and alleys and water sewer systems, showing signs of torture and execution, were found all across the capital of Iraq in the month of May. And the month of May is not over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four million Iraqis, including 1.6 million children, have fled their homes because of the violence, setting the stage for a massive humanitarian crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military has been pushed to the breaking point. To make up for the shortages of combat-ready forces, tours of duty have now been extended from 12 to 15 months, with many soldiers now in their third and fourth tours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I spoke just last week to one Nevada family whose son was killed in action last week. We all remember there were three hostages, prisoners of war. I called the father, and he said: I pray that my boy is one of the three. There were four that were unidentified. Well, his prayers were not answered. His son was the one incinerated in the humvee, and they had to wait until they took DNA to find out it was his son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This soldier had survived four vehicle explosions during his four tours of duty. That is too much to ask of any soldier or his family. Perhaps, not surprisingly after all, this soldier expressed reservations about the war in Iraq, is what he told his best friend before he left for the fourth time. His grandfather said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a waste of young lives. We should not be in the middle of a civil war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, our capacity to respond to other challenges around the world has been greatly constrained. Terror attacks across the world are up, not down. U.S. influence and standing is down, not up. By focusing on Iraq and doing little or nothing in the rest of the Middle East, this critical region has been destabilized even further and stands even closer to a broader regional war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people saw all this unfolding last November and they reached a conclusion that enough was enough. That is why they sent this President and Congress a clear and unmistakable challenge and a direct message: Find a responsible end to this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what congressional Democrats have done. From the very first day of this democratically controlled Congress, we have made it clear to the President that the days of blank checks and green lights for his failed policy are over. After 6 years of rubberstamping President Bush's failed policy, Congress has reasserted its rightful position in our constitutional form of Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats have held more hearings on Iraq in 4 months than the Republican-controlled Congress held in 4 years. We have repeatedly forced our Republican colleagues in the Senate and in the House to debate and vote on where people stand with respect to the President's failed Iraq policy. With each step we have taken, the pressure on the President and his Republican allies to change course has grown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important step we have taken occurred last month. In the face of heavy White House pressure and more misleading statements by administration officials, Congress was able to pass a bill that did what the American people asked us to do: No. 1, fully fund our troops and, No. 2, immediately change the direction of the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill provides much needed funds to procure additional equipment for our Guard and Reserve and to provide health care services for active-duty troops and America's heroic veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senate Democratic leader, I am very proud of Senate Democrats. In less than 4 months of Democratic control, with virtual Democratic unanimity, Congress sent the President binding language that would truly compel him to do what the American people desire. Unfortunately, though, the President vetoed that important legislation, leaving him further isolated from the American people, military experts, and an increasing number of his own political party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days since that veto, we have had negotiations with the administration about how to proceed. The President made it very clear as late as last night that he intended to veto any effort to implement timelines, transition the mission, or ensure the readiness of our troops before they are deployed. Furthermore, here in the Senate our minority colleagues made it clear they are determined to place procedural hurdles, most notably requiring 60 votes rather than a simple majority, in front of  those who seek to significantly alter the President's Iraq policy. Democratic unanimity with a handful of Republicans will not be sufficient to do what we believe must be done. Until more Republicans develop the courage to step forward and insist that the President change course in Iraq, Republican intransigence has left us with no good options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How to vote on this bill before us is a very difficult and personal decision for each Member of this Senate. There are many thoughtful members of my caucus who believe we should vote no, and continue to vote no until the President and his supporters come to their senses. There are equally thoughtful members who believe we must vote yes because this bill does take a step forward in holding the President and the Iraqis accountable and it does increase pressure on this administration and its supporters  to change direction in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this is a very close call for me, as I suspect it is for many Senators, I have decided to support this measure. But let me say, I know those who oppose this bill care as deeply about the safety of our troops as I do. They know I care as deeply about changing the course in Iraq as they do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill before us clearly does not go as far as a bipartisan majority of Congress would like. But it goes a lot further than the President and his supporters were willing to go earlier this month. That is why we saw this headline in a recent edition of the Los Angeles Times. Here is what it said: "Senate Tilting On Iraq Policies; Republicans Show Their Strongest Willingness Yet To Rein In Bush."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what the bill requires of the administration and Iraqis, the one before us tonight: It establishes 18 benchmarks on which to measure the Iraqi Government's performance; restricts the use of foreign aid to the Iraqi Government should they fail to make meaningful progress; requires the President to certify that the Iraqi Government deserves these funds even if they fail to perform as promised; requires the administration to testify before Congress and an independent assessment by the Government</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accountability Office on the performance of the Iraqi Government; requires the President submit a report on the combat proficiency of Iraqi security forces; requires the President to redeploy our troops if the Iraqi Government concludes our presence is no longer desired; restricts use of Defense Department funding until Congress receives information about contractors in Iraq; and states official U.S. policy precludes permanent military bases in Iraq, no torture of detainees, and no designs on  Iraqi oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the President signs the bill, that will be the law. Some of this language is taken from an amendment offered by Senator John Warner last week. Senator Warner offered his amendment as an alternative to the Feingold-Reid amendment that would have immediately transitioned the mission in Iraq and required a phased redeployment by April 2008. Naturally I said the Feingold-Reid language was far superior to the Warner language. However, today we don't have the option of choosing  between Feingold-Reid and Warner. I wish we did. Although the Warner language is weak by comparison to Feingold-Reid, and I so stated on the Senate floor last week, I believe we can begin holding the administration accountable if we adopt the Warner language plus the other Iraq-related provisions contained in this bill, which I have outlined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know none of these measures comes close to the timelines and accountability provisions I supported in the vetoed bill. However, I also know these provisions will force the administration to do more than they have ever done before. I also know the stakes are too high and our obligation to the troops and the country is too great for us to stop working to force the President and his supporters to change course. The burden for securing and governing Iraq must now rest with the Iraqi people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As General Abizaid said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is easy for Iraqis to reply upon us to do this work. I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GEN Doug Lute, recently nominated by President Bush to be his war czar, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe at some point, in order to break this dependence on the coalition, you simply have to back off and let the Iraqis step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As long as I am Democratic leader and this President persists in pursuing the worst foreign policy blunder in this Nation's history, the American people should know I am determined to fight for change in Iraq. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill earlier today. We will move to it in our next work period, which starts in about 10 days. This battle for responsible and effective Iraq policy will be joined in the Senate no later than when we  take up that bill. Senate Democrats will not stop our efforts to change our course in this war until either enough Republicans join us to reject President Bush's failed policy or we get a new President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1941, in an address at Harrow School, Winston Churchill said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues here in the Senate, particularly my Republican colleagues, should know this is precisely my attitude when it comes to bringing about a change in course in the intractable civil war in Iraq. Although I didn't get everything I sought in the bill before us, and that is an understatement, I will not give up until the supporters of the President's failed policy accept the realities on the ground in Iraq, until they accept that the President's plan is not working, that this war must come  to an end, and that it is time for our troops to come home in a safe and responsible way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paraphrasing the words of Winston Churchill, when it comes to forcing the President to change course in Iraq, Senate Democrats will never give in, never give in, never, never, never.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am entering this statement in the RECORD because I am attending my daughter's graduation baccalaureate service in New York. Had I been here I would have voted in favor of the supplemental appropriations bill because I believe we must fund the troops who are in harm's way. However, I believe just as strongly that we must change our mission in Iraq away from policing a civil war and toward a much more narrowly focused goal of counterterrorism, which requires  a much smaller number of troops. That is what the Feingold-Reid amendment stood for and that is why I voted for it on May 16, 2007. Unfortunately, it did not have enough votes to pass. Our effort to force the President to change the mission in Iraq will continue almost immediately with the DOD authorization bill and will not end until we succeed.</paragraph>
