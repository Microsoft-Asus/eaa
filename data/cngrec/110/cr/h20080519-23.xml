    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank both the chairmen and the ranking members of both the subcommittee and the committee for bringing this resolution in such a timely fashion to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, on May 13, I joined Alan Kessler, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service, Nancy Sinatra, Frank Sinatra, Jr., and A.J. Lambert, Frank Sinatra's granddaughter, at a formal ceremony in New York City's Gotham Hall, where the Postal Service issued the Frank Sinatra commemorative stamp. Immediately thereafter, 120 million stamps honoring this great icon in American culture, who was both an entertainer and a humanitarian, went on sale nationwide.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H4079]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that today the House of Representatives, through its recognition of that special day of the stamp issuance as Frank Sinatra Day, is giving another well-deserved honor to this man who contributed so much to our Nation and our culture. It has been 10 years since the death of Frank Sinatra, talented singer, actor and caring person, and Sinatra's music continues to speak to each of us today in a way that is both personal and emotional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, of course, know of my personal love for Mr. Sinatra's music. At this age, I carry close to 2,000 songs on my iPod from Sinatra alone. I was introduced to the English language by listening to Frank Sinatra records when my father came back from World War II. At that time, I remember my father saying something profound. He said, "You know, the English language takes a bad rap. People say that it is not a romantic language." He said this to me in Spanish. "But," he said, "if you  listen to the way this man sings the English language, you will recognize that it is indeed a romantic language if sung properly."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Through the years, I used those records at the beginning of my time in New York City to learn to enunciate and to imitate the way he used the English language, because when he sang it was perfect. In fact, in Germany, in Japan, and other countries, businessmen use Frank Sinatra records to learn how to pronounce the English language. Maybe that is the reason why I am the only New Yorker who says "Tuesday" instead of "Toosday," because Mr. Sinatra would have never tolerated "Toosday."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Personally, for me as a fan, I know the big difference between those songs that everybody recognizes from Mr. Sinatra like "New York, New York" and "My Way," and those other bittersweet melodies that he made famous that you only listen to sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning. That was Sinatra the singer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there was another side very briefly to Mr. Sinatra. At a time when certain entertainers were not allowed to stay in certain hotels in this country, it was Mr. Sinatra who said, If they can play, I want them in my band. I don't care what they look like, I don't care what their religion is, I don't know what their color is, I don't care. If they can play and they have talent, I want them in my band. It was because of that that Las Vegas began to integrate for the first time due to that work.  This was the other side of Frank Sinatra.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, the one you will see on TV this month, Sinatra, the actor, the one that could either give you the happy-go-lucky Pal Joey, or the very daring Man With a Golden Arm, talking about drug addiction at a time when that was not a subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was the whole of Frank Sinatra, and we as Americans honor him this week with a commemorative stamp. I commend all of us to buy that stamp, and just think of this as I close. Our gossip notes, our water bills, and, yes, our love letters will carry the smile of Frank Sinatra for a time to come.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill and I commend the gentleman from New York. I regret that I have to follow the gentleman from New York, because I too grew up listening to Sinatra wondering if the Rat Pack would be my future. Now I am in Congress; it could be that it came true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But whether you admire Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, or Frank Sinatra, they all had one thing in common; they changed the world with their bigger than life behavior. They also changed the world with their generosity. Frank Sinatra was famous for his generosity. Even better than that, he was also famous for having problems with people, and then turning around and being overly generous to people that he had had difficulties with. He helped some years, many years ago give Buddy Rich, a famous jazz drummer,  money to start a band even though only a few years earlier they had been arch enemies. He picked up the hospital bills of Bela Lugosi and many others. He funded hospital activities around the world. He lived his life big and he lived it every day. He stretched. He was in fact a great actor. He was in fact somebody who would act in parts that perhaps lesser men would have shied away from, wanting to preserve their image.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And certainly his music spanned not only generations and decades, but it spanned every genre. He was able to do that. He was able to reinvent himself from the forties, the fifties, the sixties, and even the seventies. In fact, even as his age increased and perhaps just a slight bit of that famous beautiful voice disappeared, he found ways to redo music, and his music lives on today. I am not surprised that a thoroughly modern man from New York would have 2,000 Frank Sinatra songs. My only question  is, why don't you have more?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time totally in support of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from New York for sponsoring the measure at hand, and I would certainly urge passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="1144">H. Res. 1144</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>

  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.</chair>
  <chair>The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.</chair>
