  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="219">H. Res. 219</bill> provides for consideration of House Resolution 202, the 110th Congress committee funding resolution. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate in the House, equally divided and controlled by the Chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on House Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule makes in order the committee funding substitute adopted by the Committee on House Administration. It also provides for a new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, the text of which is printed in the Rules report accompanying the rule. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the resolution and provides that the resolution, as amended, shall be considered as read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the rule before us would allow for the consideration of a bipartisan committee funding resolution. It was reported out of the House Administration Committee with the support of both Chairwoman Millender-McDonald and Ranking Member Ehlers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take a moment to say how pleased I am with the way in which this bill embodies the spirit of fiscal responsibility that is so often advocated by this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The financial pressures on our government are immense. Recent years have left us with an unprecedented amount of foreign debt. At the same time, my fellow Democrats and I are struggling to ensure the safety of tens and hundreds of thousands of troops abroad, while refusing to shortchange vital domestic programs here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution reflects that reality. While not all committees have received the budget increases they hoped for, this funding resolution provides a bipartisan approach to ensuring that they can fulfill their duties and obligations without asking Congress to spend money we don't have. It includes only a 2.4 percent increase in funding from last year, one of the smallest increases in committee funding in the last 12 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As vital as it is to start bringing home some fiscal sanity back to Washington, there is another reason why the legislation is significant. As a result of actions taken by the Rules Committee yesterday, it now contains a provision that represents a profound departure from the approach that recent Republican Congresses have taken toward one of the most pivotal issues of our time, global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Global warming is not merely an environmental issue. It is also a social issue and an economic one. It affects all nations and all peoples, and its consequences, if left unchecked, could produce truly dramatic changes to human society the world over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, evidence has mounted that our planet's temperature is rising, and that evidence has become so universally recognized that it is no longer in dispute. President Bush himself even used the phrase "climate change" in his State of the Union Address this year, the first time he has acknowledged it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the question raised today by some is a different one: Is global warming caused by human activity? Or is it merely a natural phenomenon akin to the last ice age, something that we have to adapt to but we cannot affect?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Efforts to break the link in the public imagination between human activity and climate change are still ongoing. Doubt is still being seeded in the public mind. Sometimes these efforts are blunt. Despite the President's recent admission, his administration has also been accused of rewriting sections of impartial Federal scientific reports that tie human activity to global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other times, the efforts are more subtle. We hear all the time Members of this body express their desire to, as they put it, "get to the bottom" of the problem of climate change so that we may come to understand its true cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I on the Democratic side of the aisle do not share this degree of doubt, nor do we seek to disseminate it. We have been convinced by numerous internationally recognized scientific studies, by years of careful analysis and by endless measurements taken around the world. We have been convinced, as have people the world over, by the overwhelming weight of available, impartial and scientific evidence. We have been convinced of a simple idea, that human beings are altering  the planet's environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, as such, we have committed ourselves to being the party of personal, environmental responsibility. We have pledged to confront this great challenge before it is beyond our grasp, beyond our ability to change even if we wanted to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have promised a strong path of action, and this bill represents the first steps along that path taken by this Congress in years, if not ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution will create a fully funded select committee whose sole purpose will be to focus on global warming. The committee will have 15 members, nine from the majority and six from the minority. It will serve as a much-needed congressional forum for hearings, investigations and discussion, and will have the chance to make recommendations concerning climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, people all the world over can breathe easier because the resolution will institutionalize the commitment of the House of Representatives to confronting global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also want to take a moment to address one of the criticisms of this rule that is likely to be voiced by the minority. We may be told that a hearing and markup process for the select committee did not take place before the rule was authored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But a question like this one, the question of whether or not we should address global warming, has had an ongoing public hearing for a generation. Numerous arguments on both sides of the question have been made. And at the end of it all, the overwhelming consensus, both among the public and among internationally recognized climate scientists, is that global warming is real; it is human influenced; and it is our responsibility to control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The creation of this select committee is a response to that international public hearing. Democrats have called for the need to fight climate change for years, and today we have the chance to turn that call into action, and we don't intend to waste it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we can't forget that, in 1997, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a path-breaking international effort to control global warming. And we must not forget that, back in 2001, one of the administration's first acts of international significance was the dramatic rejection of that same set of principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for this House to join the vast majority of the world community that recognizes the threat global warming poses and the role that our Nation plays in it. It is time for us to be leaders on this issue and to take responsibility for our actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the passage of this rule and of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my great appreciation to my very distinguished friend from Rochester, New York, the Chair of the Committee on Rules, Ms. Slaughter, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in strongest opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation, House Resolution 202, which provides for the expenses of certain committees of the House of Representatives in the 110th Congress. While I consider the funding of the committees of the House a very, very important priority, I, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, oppose this rule since the resolution goes far beyond, far beyond the very important task in one respect, and, unfortunately, it falls extraordinarily  short in another task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on March 1, the Committee on House Administration ordered reported House Resolution 202, a clean committee funding resolution. If passed by the full House, the resolution will provide approximately a 2.6 percent across-the-board increase in House committee budgets between the last session of the 109th Congress and the first session of the 110th Congress. While most committees can make do with that very modest increase, we have one committee that absolutely cannot. It is called the  Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on the opening day of the 110th Congress, Ms. Slaughter and I both stood here as we debated and then ended up supporting a very important part of the opening day rules package. On that day, we asked the Ethics Committee to take on substantial new responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are now responsible, Mr. Speaker, the Ethics Committee, based on what the passage of the opening days rules package imposed on them, they are now required to pre-approve all trips. They are required to issue guidance on rules that they were not involved in drafting at all. As I said, we imposed that on them. They are required to provide training for every employee of the House on the new ethics rules that we have just put into place and forced them to implement. And they are still in a position  where they have to now provide timely advice to every single Member who makes a request for the application of this rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, Mr. Speaker, they have the responsibility of investigating allegations of wrongdoing whenever they do occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now already, I understand, the Committee on Ethics, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, is falling behind. Appropriation season is well under way, and we have absolutely no guidance whatsoever about the new ethics standards for earmarks. We have new travel and gift rules, but those regulations created as many questions as they answered; and the Ethics Committee is already months behind in its correspondence with Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to hear from a number of our colleagues who have been dealing with this very difficult situation. The chairman and the ranking member, the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee on Ethics appeared before the Committee on House Administration. In fact, Ms. Slaughter and I were both there because our testimony followed them. Mr. Hastings and Mrs. Tubbs Jones, Republican and Democrat in a bipartisan way, they came to plead their case to provide an  increase beyond that 2.6 percent so they can deal with this massive new mandate imposed upon them. It was a large request, but the members of the Ethics Committee need it because they want to do their job and they need the resources to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the House Administration Committee did, and we were there during that testimony, they expressed great sympathy with their plight. And at the end, they felt they could do a little more. That decision leaves every single Member of this House in jeopardy, and it is one that we cannot let stand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why, as I said, Mr. Hastings, the former chairman of the Ethics Committee and Mrs. Tubbs Jones, the new chairman of the Ethics Committee, took the very unusual step of just yesterday appealing to us up in the Rules Committee to correct this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now my Rules Committee colleague, Mr. Hastings, has the dual responsibility of serving not only as the distinguished ranking member of the Ethics Committee, but also he serves on the Rules Committee, and he sat before us and asked that we simply allow the House to debate this issue. He didn't argue that we have to do it. I happen to believe we do have to do it, but he simply was making the request that the Rules Committee make in order a chance for this House to discuss this very important  ethics issue, one with which we are all very familiar. He was joined in this request by the distinguished Chair of the committee. She wasn't there, but I know she has supported his request for us to have an opportunity to debate this issue, and I know she strongly supports the effort, as she did in her testimony before the Administration Committee asking for the additional resources so the Ethics Committee, Mr. Speaker, can in fact do their job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is particularly important given the other aspect of this rule. This rule self-executes an amendment establishing the new Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, about which the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee was just speaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without impugning the necessity or desire to establish that select committee, my colleagues got to hear me explain at the Rules Committee yesterday exactly why this process was so outrageous and why this is the wrong way to go about establishing a select committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, never mind that the minority was never given the language creating this select committee until we literally walked into the room yesterday at 2 p.m., and never mind the fact the Democratic majority is denying us a motion to recommit with instructions which would have been made in order if the privileged resolution came to the floor, never mind that the Rules Committee never held a hearing or produced an original jurisdiction committee report on the establishment of this select committee,  something I believe is totally unprecedented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all of the committees established in the history of this institution, I am convinced that never before has this process been used, and never mind that the House is completely side-stepping regular order by self-executing this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, never mind all of those horrible procedural outrages that have been imposed. I am not going to talk about those. The most troubling part of this whole episode is that this self-executing amendment grants the new select committee some $3.7 million over the course of this Congress. So if we can find an additional $3.7 million to fund this new select committee that will have no legislative power whatsoever, I don't understand why we can't fund a mere $1 million to fully fund the bipartisan  request that was made before the Rules Committee to provide the necessary funding for our very hardworking colleagues, Mr. Hastings, Mrs. Tubbs Jones and their colleagues on the Ethics Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the end of this debate on this rule, I will be asking Members to oppose the previous question so I may amend the rule to make in order the bipartisan Tubbs Jones-Hastings amendment so that the 430 Members that supported the new ethics rules may live up to the commitment that they made right here on opening day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if you think we needed new ethics standards, if you believe that the Ethics Committee should do its job, then you have a moral obligation to defeat the previous question and allow the House to work its will by at least considering the chance to make sure that Mrs. Tubbs Jones, the distinguished Chair of the Ethics Committee, and Mr. Hastings, the ranking member, have the resources they need to do what we, 430 Members, told them they had to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me take 30 seconds to say to my good friend, Mr. Dreier, that while he has made much of the fact that a bipartisan group went before the committee to beg for money, that it was turned down by a bipartisan pair, the Chair and the ranking member of that committee, perhaps he should take up his complaint with Mr. Ehlers who was the Republican ranking member on that committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the issue here is global warming. There is a separate issue of Ethics Committee funding. It should be clear to all of us that we don't have to combine the two to let both defeat what is in the interest of this country to achieve. The crisis of global warming is real. It is urgent and it requires our immediate action. By embracing the challenge of global warming, we can open the door to innovative local approaches as we work towards solutions that are going to  create jobs, improve the environment, and improve and strengthen our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very critical issue in my own State, as it is in every State. Even in a small State such as Vermont, we realize that we can and we must make a contribution towards a more sustainable local economy, a more environmentally friendly future. Meaningful Federal policy must be part of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend this House of Representatives' bipartisan action that in our first days we reversed those tax breaks that went to big oil companies and instead funded renewable energy. The leadership in this Congress has also set a priority on making a green capital initiative. We are going to work, I hope together with my friend from California, on greening this capital and putting our example forward as part of what can be achieved.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would just like to say that I do look forward, Mr. Speaker, to working with my friend from Vermont on this very, very important issue. And we are at this moment, in fact, going through his legislative initiative. I hope to work closely with him on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from California. What that is about, we can take concrete steps. Last month my office introduced a bill that would allow us to be a carbon-neutral office by working with a couple of local initiatives in Vermont to offset the 54 tons of carbon pollution that turning on the lights in my office here in Washington and my office at home in Vermont and my travel back and forth around the State generates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we can accomplish by working together requires us to take concrete steps together. This committee, this special select committee, is something in my view that deserves bipartisan support because we have to focus the attention of this Congress on the big issue of global warming, but also on the concrete and specific steps that we can take that will reduce the damage that we do to the environment by our activities by creating jobs that will increase wealth and economic security for our country,  and absolutely take steps towards reducing the stranglehold that foreign oil has on limiting our foreign policy options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is overdue and something that can be accomplished, and I commend the Speaker for her initiative in putting together this special panel that is going to help this Congress and this country make the overdue steps that are required.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to yield 3 minutes to my very good friend, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards, the gentleman from Pasco, Washington (Mr. Hastings).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from San Dimas for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to House Resolution 219. I am disappointed that a bipartisan amendment that I offered, along with the chairman of the Ethics Committee, Chairwoman TUBBS JONES of Ohio, to the Rules Committee was not made in order under this closed rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment that we offered would simply set the funding levels for the Ethics Committee at the level that was requested by Chairwoman TUBBS JONES and by me, the amount that we jointly determined was necessary to effectively carry out the Ethics Committee's responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the budget we requested was not provided by the House Administration Committee. Yesterday, the Rules Committee refused to allow the House to vote on whether the Ethics Committee will have the resources it needs to fully fund its responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Ethics Committee is responsible for two primary tasks: one, educating, informing and advising members and staff about their ethical responsibilities pursuant to the House rules; and, two, enforcing those rules firmly and fairly without regard to friendship, favor, or political party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago in a bipartisan fashion, I requested a substantial increase in funding to better fulfill these responsibilities, and I was pleased that 2 years ago the House Administration Committee supported and approved the full funding that was requested. However, as the Speaker and Members know, the 110th Congress passed significant changes to the House rules that we are living under in this Congress. Those rules require, Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat, require that our committee take on additional  responsibilities that we haven't had in the past in areas of gift, private travel, mandatory ethics training, and public disclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our budget request this year, $6.11 million, and it is the lowest of any standing committee in the House, would provide the additional staff to improve the quality of advice, authorize detailees from the Government Accountability Office to help process public disclosure office, increase ethics training for Members and staff throughout the country, and enhance the communication of the new ethics rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the need to live under a tight budget. Yet the budget requested by the Ethics Committee for this Congress is not arbitrary. It is the amount of funds needed to do the work that we are asked to do by a vote of the House. Limiting the Ethics Committee budget limits the Ethics Committee's ability to do its job. I do regret that this matter has reached the House floor, and I know that the chairwoman and I seek simply to have the resources we need to serve Members of  this House and to uphold the integrity of this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to working hand in hand with the chairwoman, and I know that she is sincerely dedicated to carrying out the committee's responsibilities. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I must ask my colleagues to join me in voting against the rule and against the previous question so that the amendment providing the Ethics Committee the necessary funding can be considered by the full House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to enter into the Record a very important piece of information which has just come my way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Printed in the New York Times this morning: "Internal memorandums circulated in the Alaskan division of the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service appear to require government biologists or other employees traveling in countries around the Arctic not to discuss climate change, polar bears or sea ice if they are not designated to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In December, the Bush administration, facing a deadline under a suit by environmental groups, proposed listing polar bears throughout their range as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because the warming climate is causing a summertime retreat of sea ice that the bears use for seal hunting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It remains unclear whether such a listing will be issued. Over the past  week, biologists and wildlife officials received a cover note and two sample memorandums to be used as a guide in preparing travel requests. Under the heading `Foreign Travel--New Requirement--Please Review and Comply, Importance: High,' the cover note said."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>" `Please be advised that all foreign travel requests and any future travel requests involving or potentially involving climate change, sea ice and/or polar bears will also require a memorandum from the regional director to the director indicating who'll be the official spokesman on the trip and the one responding to questions on these issues, particularly polar bears.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The sample memorandums, described as to be used in written travel requests, indicate that the employees seeking permission to travel `understands the administration's position on climate change, polar bears, and sea ice will not be speaking on or responding to these issues.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Electronic copies of the memorandums and cover note were forwarded to The New York Times by Deborah Williams, an environmental campaigner in Alaska and a former Interior Department official in the Clinton administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>" `This sure sounds like a Soviet-style directive to me,' Ms. Williams said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Limits on government scientists' freedom to speak freely about climate change became a heated issue last year after news report showed that political appointees at NASA had canceled journalists' interview requests with climate scientists and discouraged news releases on global warming."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if there was ever a time for this Congress to take up global warming, and if there was ever a question that it was not the position of this administration to ignore it, I hope this puts it to rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me say, we are all concerned about global warming. At this time, I would like to yield 2 minutes to my very distinguished friend from Miami (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that our colleagues that may be watching this debate realize what is being debated. That is, that at the beginning of this Congress, as we all know because we voted on it, the Congress, pursuant to the request of the new majority and the Rules of the House, significantly increased the responsibilities of the Ethics Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the Ethics Committee and the distinguished ranking member sought to have an amendment made in order in this legislation before us today, which is funding of the committees, to sufficiently fund the Ethics Committee, especially now that it has new significant additional responsibilities. That amendment was not made in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are saying is, let's defeat the previous question so that the Ethics Committee, with all of its additional new responsibilities, can be funded because you can't have the newspaper article saying, oh, we're increasing all these requirements, ethics requirements, that are going to be supervised and executed by the Ethics Committee and then not fund the Ethics Committee sufficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what our distinguished friends in the majority are doing. They get the headlines, but then they don't want to fund the Ethics Committee sufficiently so it can do its job correctly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are saying is, defeat the previous question and let's not support this rule because we need to fund the Ethics Committee sufficiently so it can do its job.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from California giving me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to this closed rule and to the unprecedented creation of a new panel with no legislative jurisdiction and no authority to take legislative action. Mr. Speaker, it is like being air-dropped into this usually noncontroversial resolution without any committee oversight or consideration being given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost to the taxpayers for this lopsided new committee to study the serious issue of climate change but that is not given the power by the Democrat leadership of actually doing anything; yet it costs $4 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution also represents an increase of 14.3 percent over last year's Congress, raising the funding levels for these committees and staff salaries from just over $250 million to just over $291 million, one Congress to the next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But with all of this new spending, the Democrat majority cannot find a way to adequately fund one of the most vocally stated priorities, at least on the campaign trail, the Ethics Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This lack of funding is hindering the committee's struggle to untangle the confusingly drafted new ethics package passed by the new Democrat majority and to provide the training mandated by House Rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, today, the American people can see where the Democrats' true priorities lie, in crafting and creating an unfunded mandate and leaving a campaign promise unfilled, while spending millions of taxpayer dollars on a new panel that has no authority to do anything.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am compelled to come to the floor and stand up and speak in opposition to this rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rules package that came before the floor of the House, an unamendable rules package, was amended before it came to the 109th, to the 110th Congress, eliminating the requirement that the Rules Committee and other committee votes be published when there is a recorded vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, before the Rules Committee, I brought an amendment that would require the Rules Committee to print recorded votes if they were to receive any of the funding that is authorized. I got about a third of the way through my presentation when I was interrupted by the chair, and the point was made that they have printed their votes to this date. The argument was made that since they have complied with my amendment, then there is no reason for my amendment, in fact, no latitude for me to continue  my debate with regard to that and my presentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in opposition to this rule because, first of all, we need to have sunlight on everything we do, and a requirement to provide to the public access to recorded votes is something that ought to be in the rule. It ought not to be an option. If it is the practice of the Rules Committee, then this amendment codifies the practice of the Rules Committee, and it should not receive objection, especially the vociferous interruption objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also object to the way I was treated before the Rules Committee. I will keep coming back regardless. I will not be intimidated, and I intend to raise the sunlight on everything we do in this Congress. I want to see all of our  work become available on the Internet, in a searchable, sortable, downloadable format. I want all the sunlight possible, so the bloggers can see, and I would love to see television cameras up before the Rules Committee as well,  Mr. Speaker. I think that will help the decorum of the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I intend to come back. Like the Governor from California, I will be back.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in opposition to the previous question for the committee funding resolution. The resolution at hand underfunds our Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, not compared to previous years but in light of problems that exist and the education that is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time crucial to restoring America's faith in our ability to govern ourselves, the Rules Committee dismissed an amendment offered by Chairwoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES and Ranking Member DOC HASTINGS which would have allowed us to equip the Ethics Committee with the resources necessary for enacting meaningful reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opposing this previous question will enable the House to consider the amendment to fully fund the Ethics Committee, which I believe will actually save us money in the long run, and I encourage my colleagues to allow us to debate and support this important amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some will say that the increase to the Ethics Committee is already substantial. To those Members, I would like to remind them that when making their request, the chairwoman and ranking member took into consideration the past problems and the recent changes to our rules, and determined the staffing and resources necessary to provide training, oversight and interpretation of those rules to this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have rightfully tightened our travel rules, requiring preapproval; finally banned travel on corporate jets; and we have enacted specific restrictions on accepting food and drinks at briefings, and T-shirts or books from organizations or constituents. Some are allowed, and some are not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, more than a memo is needed to convey these guidelines. Members and staff should already be receiving training on the Rules governing the 110th Congress. Instead, we are beginning the month of March, and it is unclear even when the training could be available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of the new rules already adopted, there is more to be done, in my opinion. We need to have a permanent and professional committee staff, and we need to expand ethics training to lobbyists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we expect the committee to exercise duties of even the most minimum oversight and investigations with a budget that does not meet the stated needs of the chairwoman and the ranking member of that committee?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As elected representatives, we come to Congress with the trust of those we represent. The poor decisions of a few have dishonored this great body and have challenged the faith Americans deserve to have in each of us. Enforcing high standards of ethics and civility may seem to be the responsibility of the majority party, but they are, in fact, essential within every one of us elected to hold the public trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this previous question to allow consideration of this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 3 1/2  minutes to a thoughtful former member of the Committee on Rules, the gentleman from Moore, Oklahoma, (Mr. Cole).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the rule and the underlying bill as it is currently written. Frankly, my concerns are not about the global warming issue. It is about the ethics issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former member of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, I understand and appreciate the tremendously difficult job that we ask the staff and the members of that committee to face on a daily basis. It is common knowledge in this body that no one wants to serve on the Ethics Committee. It is a responsibility that no one seeks but, frankly, must be handled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, frankly, everyone understands that there have been ethical lapses by some of our colleagues in the last few years. That committee has dealt with those lapses as best it could, handling a workload that is unpredictable, and it is by its very nature highly charged and occasionally and unfortunately partisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To do that job, the last Congress increased the funding for the committee by approximately 40 percent. Even that was probably not enough to handle the job which had been given to us by the House, but it is certainly not enough to deal with the new responsibilities that the majority has chosen to extend to that committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority party ran on a platform of ethics and made it a major issue in the last campaign, and frankly, it passed with strong, bipartisan support an ethics package as the very first act that calls, again, on Members to do more in the committee to supervise and do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the majority party is actually refusing to do what they promised; that is, they are refusing to fund the 41 percent increase in the underlying legislation that their own chairman of the Ethics Committee and the ranking member have jointly requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been able to find millions of dollars to fund the global warming effort, a select committee, a committee, frankly, that has no duties, no responsibilities, no legislative priorities, but it is an important committee, and I recognize the importance of looking at that extremely important issue. At the same time, we will not fund a committee that already has the smallest budget of any standing committee, whose responsibilities we have magnified, compounded and increased greatly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues on the other side of the aisle again made ethics a major issue in the last campaign, and frankly, they have threatened to make it a major issue in the next campaign. Fair enough. I think everybody should be scrutinized that is privileged to serve in this body, but if you are going to do that, you have to give the committee the financial resources to do the job that it is charged to do, and frankly, you have to provide the Members of this body with the services that they need to  avoid inadvertently breaking the rules and becoming the target for political cheap shots, whether they are launched by one side or the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is simply irresponsible to the Members of this body. I am not surprised that our friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to yield us some more time to talk about this simply because they are in an indefensible position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do the right thing: Vote against this hollow rule and give the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct the funding it needs to get its job done.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman who chairs the Ethics Committee, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairwoman, thank you for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I was actually in a Ways and Means hearing on waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, and all of a sudden, someone called and said, they're using your name, they're using your name, they're using your name. So I turned on the television to see what was going on, and I was forced to come to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, let me say that I feel like I am blessed to have the opportunity to chair the Ethics Committee of the U.S. Congress. I come from Cleveland, Ohio. My father carried bags for 40 years for United Airlines, and my mother was a factory worker. To have the opportunity to sit in this seat, the seat that my predecessor, the honorable Congressman Louis Stokes, held for so  many years is indeed an honor and an opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so pleased to have an opportunity to work with the committee of men and women who want to do the job of chairing and overseeing the Ethics Committee. I want you to know that DOC HASTINGS and I have worked together for the past 5 or 6 years on ethics, and we will continue to work diligently on behalf of the Members of Congress, the people of the United States, because it is through our responsibilities that we will be able to help people to understand how great the Members of the U.S.  Congress are and how great we are at doing our job and taking our responsibilities seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to the floor reluctantly. I did, in fact, sponsor an amendment with DOC HASTINGS and both of us, in fact, believe that the Ethics Committee could use additional dollars; but I am not going to be used. I am not going to allow the process of a bill with regard to other issues to hold up the dollars that are available to other committees. We understand we operate within a framework of having only so much money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was not the Rules Committee that had the responsibilities of granting additional dollars. It was the previous committee that previously said on a bipartisan basis, we are not going to give you any more money. So here comes the Rules Committee. We lost in the Rules Committee. I am a big girl, I lost that money, but it doesn't mean I am not going to do my job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me finish. Then you can jump up, and, Mr. Dreier, I will, in fact, yield you some of my time. I guarantee you that there may be another mechanism or another vehicle for us to be able to provide the support to the Ethics Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Understand, we are going to do our job. We are going to do our job, and I am not going to be used or my amendment to allow anyone to say we can't do our job. Guaranteed, I wouldn't have taken the job. Nancy Pelosi said I was tough and smart. I am both of those. Doc Hastings is tough, and he is smart. We will do our job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you for elevating the Ethics Committee to a level where people think that we ought to have another opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so happy to see the majority leader on the floor. We are both from Ohio. In fact, I am going to yield you some of my time. Come on, baby, let's talk. Let's interact.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Would the gentlelady yield?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Absolutely.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentlelady yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the gentlelady from Ohio, knows I have deep respect for her and the other members of the Ethics Committee and Mr. Hastings. They do a good job on behalf of our Members, and it is thankful from the Members, but it is a very unwelcome job that you have; and we do appreciate your work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With what the House did in early January, in terms of adopting a new ethics package, it is clear that the responsibility of the Ethics Committee has expanded significantly. Members supported that, and I think it is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we all know, and I am not going to talk about the amendment that was offered last night, but there is insufficient money in the budget for the Ethics Committee to do what we have charged them with doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we do this with Federal agencies all the time and can look the other way. If we want Members to abide by the rules that we have adopted, we have to have an Ethics Committee that can provide services to those Members so they understand the rules, they understand the limits, what they can and can't do. The concern that we have is that because there is insufficient money for the Ethics Committee in this resolution that Members are going to be charged with living under new rules and not having  the service component necessary from the Ethics Committee to carry out our job.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Boehner, thank you very much, all of you. But let's find a forum to address this issue other than in this process. I guarantee you that our leadership can sit down and work this out. I'm not going to be used. I'm telling you, the Ethics Committee has to stand on its own. We are not going to be in this process. Let's find a way. There is a vehicle by which we can work on giving the Ethics Committee the money that they need without being caught up in this process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First, let me say I have utmost respect for both Ohioans, Mr. Boehner and Mrs. Jones, as well as the ranking member of the Ethics Committee, Mr. Hastings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on the opening day, we did, in fact, establish unprecedented ethics rules. Since that time, we have continued to hear complaints from Members about the lack of ability for the Committee on Standards to provide Members with information that is needed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Dreier, I take my time back. You can continue to make those comments if you want to, but I guarantee you that the Members who needed to get information by a certain date got their information.

  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are trying to get the resources necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I am happy to yield 4 minutes to my very good friend, my California colleague who serves on the House Administration Committee, Mr. Lungren.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the time that the Ethics Committee came before our committee for their funding, I inquired as to what they needed, because I was concerned about the insufficiency of funds for that committee per the directions we had received from the leadership as to what we could actually give them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So during that presentation before our committee, the distinguished chairwoman of the committee said these words regarding her request: "These positions," that is the positions that will be funded by their additional money request, "are needed to satisfy the mandates of the House Ethics Committee." She continued: "Importantly, the figures presented today represent the collaborative efforts of my ranking member, Representative Doc Hastings, and I to advance," again, quoting her,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the nub of this whole debate. That is why we ask that this rule be voted down and that we will be allowed to have an amendment dealing specifically with funding for the Ethics Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to understand, "additional mandates," those are the words from the chairperson of the committee, current mandates of the House ethics rules. I am just asking Members on both sides of the aisle to think about this. We have said that we are going to be the most ethical Congress in history. We have adopted new rules that mandate new concerns with specificity as to conduct by Members and their staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the enforcing mechanisms is guidance to be given to us by that very Ethics Committee. Therefore, we have imposed additional obligations, additional work on that committee; and yet we are not giving them the additional resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if I were a corporation having received the new mandate under Sarbanes-Oxley, and the first thing I told my employees and my shareholders is, I am not going to beef up our lawyers, I am not going to beef up our accountants to give us advice as to what we should do under the law, the shareholders would probably throw me out of my position because I would not be doing the job that is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We on this floor in these committees have two shareholders. We have our peers, that is the other Members to whom we owe a responsibilities to give them that which they need to ensure that they follow those rules, and we have an obligation to our ultimate shareholders, the taxpayers of America, our constituents, who expect us to put our money where our mouth is to expect us to live up to our promises. May I just say, I thank the committee for the work they did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had to make a specific request of the committee about a particular trip I was going on to visit a friend that I have known for 40-some years, before our last break, and I received oral assurance from the committee that it was appropriate. But, technically, I was supposed to receive written assurance, and I received that a week after the visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it turned out my wife slipped on the ice and we were not able to go on the visit, so I have to write a letter to the committee to make it clear I didn't do that, and that is why it will not be in my report at the end of the year. But the fact of the matter is, those technical violations that could occur because we don't give them enough in the way of personnel can come back to haunt us as individual Members, but, more importantly, to undercut, undercut the confidence the American people  have in this place that we are ethical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All I am saying is, we can save money in a number of different places; but we ought not to skimp on this particular issue, this particular committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I would ask Members to vote down this rule so we can have this simple amendment brought forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Rules how many speakers she has remaining.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, obviously there has been a great deal of thought and talk, and it has been understandable about the issue of ethics and lobbying reform. Last year, Speaker Hastert and I initiated a package that we passed through the House but, unfortunately, we were not able to come to an agreement in the Senate. On the opening day, 430 Members voted to put into place unprecedented ethics reform, unprecedented ethics reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Because the American people know we should be held to the highest possible standards. Now, there is an expression that I think is a very important one, and that is "put your money where your mouth is." Now the very distinguished Chair of the committee on ethics, my good friend Mrs. Jones, talked about the fact that she wants to address this as concerns come forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the committee funding measure that we are bringing to the floor. We are doing some other things to it, self-executing establishment of a committee, but we are providing for that committee that will have no legislative authority whatsoever, $3.7 million. All we are asking, Mr. Speaker, is that we have a chance, a chance to debate the issue of funding for the Ethics Committee here on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am going to urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question. Why? Because while this new committee that will have no legislative authority whatsoever will receive $3.7 million, we are simply asking for what is being denied, and that is a chance for $1 million to be provided so that our Members will not be facing the weekend situation that Mr. Lungren just described where he sent a letter to the Ethics Committee, asked for a response about going on a trip, and  he didn't receive approval until a week after the trip was to take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Jones and Mr. Hastings came before the House Administration Committee and made this request for additional funding; and Mr. Hastings, representing Mrs. Jones before the Rules Committee, asked that this amendment be made in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, any Member who votes for the previous question is denying this institution the opportunity to consider implementing the resources that are necessary to hold us to the highest possible ethical standards. Vote "no" on the previous question.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="202">H. Res. 202</bill>, which provides approximately a 2.4 percent increase to committee budgets in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe I speak for both myself and my colleague, Ms. Millender-McDonald, when I say we would have liked to have seen a larger increase to relieve some of the financial constraints that have been placed on committees. I totally agree with her concerns, which she expressed a moment ago, about the salaries of staff members, both in personal offices and in committees, and several Members on our side of the aisle have raised that same concern with me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We, of course, as Members of the Congress, will not receive any increase in salary this year, but we expected that, and we have no problem dealing with that. However, it is different for our staffs. They have lush fields of opportunity outside of this institution, and we hope that all staff members will bear with us during this lean time during the next year or two and not be attracted to these lush fields, but remain with us, so that the institution can continue to function as well as it has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee and ranking members alike face an increasing workload each year with limited resources and staff. Despite the funding limitations we have this year, it is my sincere hope that even a modest increase will be of use to committees in performing the important work that they do, and also my fond hope that through a normal appropriations process this year, there will be adequate funding to deal with the business of the Congress during the next fiscal year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My goal during the course of providing funding levels for House committees in the 110th Congress has been twofold: first, to maintain what has in the last few years been a relatively smooth committee funding process. Many of our chairmen and ranking members have established standing precedents about the operating practices within their respective committees and have functioned for many years in accordance with those principles. Based on the productive hearing we held last week during which the  chairs and ranking members testified on their budget requests, I believe we have continued that smooth process following the pattern of the last several Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I wanted to ensure that an equitable division of funding continues. When the Republicans previously served in the minority, we were not provided with sufficient funds or staff. As an example, one of the major committees was given only 11 percent of the resources assigned to that committee, whereas the then majority, the Democrats, retained 89 percent for themselves. This is not appropriate or fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of the past 12 years, the Committee on House Administration has reached an agreement on maintaining two-thirds of the funding for the majority and one-third for the minority, and I am very pleased that every committee chairman who came before the committee promised to honor and continue that commitment, that allocation, and we are delighted that the new majority's continuation of that split will serve as good guidance for the future as well. It is vital to the strength of the  House of Representatives as an institution that the minority, no matter which party it is, continues to be given adequate resources, and that each chairman and ranking member be able to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory for both parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adjustments to the two-thirds/one-third budget allocation have been made  in the past, for instance through the years of shared staff or a centrally managed budget for non-personnel expenditures. My goal is not to discourage these types of arrangements between the chairman and the ranking minority member. In fact, I admire the creativity and cooperation demonstrated by some of our chairmen and ranking members to establish a process that works for their  particular committees. However, I do want to ensure that those in the minority continue to be given adequate resources and that each chairman and ranking member are able to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory for both parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude by thanking our chairwoman, Ms. Millender-McDonald, for conducting this process in an open and transparent fashion. While we were only able to provide a small percentage increase for each committee when compared to last year's budget, we are pleased that we have accomplished the goals of a smooth process that maintains the two-thirds/one-third allocation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), a junior member of our committee, but a very experienced junior member, one of the outstanding freshmen and a member of the steering committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412190" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the work that he has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reluctantly oppose this. As a member of the House Administration Committee, I sat through the hearings that we had, where the chairmen and the ranking members came before us and talked about what they needed in funding, and it was our accountability, our role to oversee that. We went through the committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But after this resolution was done and went to the Rules Committee, the Rules Committee created a new select committee, added $3.7 million, going beyond the jurisdiction of House Administration. Where is the accountability? Where is the approval process? Where is the role of this House and this committee to oversee that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Rules Committee felt we had $3.7 million more to spend, I think there would be other places to spend it. For one, when we look at the ethics and the changes in this House and what this House wants to accomplish, I am a new Member, I sat on this floor the day we were sworn in, and I listened to our Speaker when she said she wanted a new House, when she talked about changing partisanship and making it partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not see partnership with the Rules Committee overstepping the bounds of the House Administration Committee. I do not see partnership when we have put new rules on this floor, when the Ethics Committee needs to oversee them, when the Ethics Committee needs to be able to interpret them and bring them back to this floor so this floor understands it, is able to live by it and be the House that the people want it to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand before you reluctantly, because I voted for the version that went before the House Administration Committee, but I will not vote for the version that came back from the Rules Committee. I believe it is overstepping its bounds. I believe the jurisdiction, the accountability, rests in the House Administration Committee, just like every other individual when they were the chair or ranking member and had to stand before us and had to justify the money they were going to spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for a brief comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his comments, and I certainly agree with him. It would have been much better had that special committee been processed through the Committee on House Administration, as all other committees are. I want to also let him know it is even worse than he said, because the total over the 2-year life of this special committee, the select committee that is being formed, is approximately, $3.7 million, which is a large amount of money for any committee  to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 9 minutes to another gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren), who is also on our committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at first I would like to congratulate both the chairwoman and the ranking member of this committee for the bipartisan way in which they have acted in bringing this bill to the floor, this funding resolution, which is part of the regular business of this House, making sure that we can do the people's business here in an organized fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We listened to all of the presentations made by the various committee chairs and ranking members. I was very pleased to see the agreement on the one-third/two-thirds funding rule. As one who served here in a prior life, I can recall when it wasn't so. I can recall at one point in time on one of the committees that I won't mention where I believe the difference in staff ratio at the time I served was something like 7-to-1. I can recall when we got something like 11 percent of the total funding.  That made it difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We used to encourage our people by saying you have to be that much better than the others. We have to be seven times better. You have to work seven times harder. You can only say that for so long, and you can only do so much with limited resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the rule that has been established over the last number of years that the minority receives one-third of the funding, approximately, is one that works well for both the majority and the minority. It is good for the minority to have sufficient resources so they not only can present their point of view, but also it keeps the majority on its toes. The direct result of that is better legislative product. So I am pleased that that came through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I must once again register my objection to our inability to give appropriate funding to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. As the chairwoman of that committee said when she appeared before our committee, "Ethics is neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue. It is an American issue."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an issue that is essential to the proper functioning of this House, and it is something for which we have received black eyes of recent vintage and for which we deserve those black eyes because of the conduct of errant Members in this House. And to provide against that from happening again, to encourage that that does not happen again, we have adopted more stringent rules than we have had in this House, in recent memory at least.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to assure that Members are able to follow the details of the rules that have been established, the Ethics Committee, or the committee properly understood as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, has been given additional responsibilities so that Members can rely on their advice in a timely fashion. They do great work. We have dedicated people there, but they will not be able to do the job we give them without additional resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This should not be a partisan issue. I for the life of me do not understand the decision made not to give this money. I would have thought the leadership could have put a spotlight on this, given additional money to the Ethics Committee and issued a press release about how they were ensuring that we were going to actually put our money where our mouth was and we were going to have the adequate resources in order to make real the promise that we have given the American people on ethics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the life of me, I don't understand why we couldn't find another $1 million for the Ethics Committee. I don't serve on the Ethics Committee, but I don't want to see a Member caught in technical violation of the rules we have adopted for lack of adequate information or available or timely information. I don't want to see a Member who has technically violated our rules because that Member couldn't get a timely response from the committee. Not because the committee doesn't wish to give them that,  but because the committee essentially doesn't have the personnel to be able to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We may very well tie ourselves up in knots. Now, the American people probably aren't concerned about whether  we tie ourselves up in knots, but they are concerned about whether our actions reflect the best standards of ethics that we can have. So it is a question of maintaining the confidence of the American people in this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come here not to talk about a partisan issue and not to talk about an issue that just affects Members of Congress, but an institutional issue. If, in fact, we have created a bond with the American people, and part of that bond is a contract where we hold ourselves out to perform our duties at the highest level of ethical conduct, then in fact we should ensure that that is not difficult to do, but that is expected and easy to do because we have established the strictures in this  House and we have established the resources to allow Members to perform within those ethical strictures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I would stand on this floor today and say that the request of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for $6.1 million, which would be an increase of $1.35 million, is absolutely necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had every intention of supporting the committee's work on this and being able to recommend this to my fellow Members. I cannot do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the argument about the other committee that came in with the funding that was put in by a self-executing aspect of the rule just adopted. But that is not what I am arguing about. I am arguing about the absolutely essential need for us to give sufficient resources for the Committee on Ethics to do its work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairwoman of the committee said in testimony to us directly, these positions that are requested by the Ethics Committee for which they sought the funding that was denied them, these positions are needed to satisfy the mandates of the House ethics rule. She did not say it would be nice to have them. These are additional. These are surplus, to make sure we can do our job. The words were carefully chosen: These positions are needed to satisfy the mandates of the House Ethics Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We need to continue talking about this. We need to work as a committee. If we can do anything about this, I would implore the leadership to take another look at this because it doesn't hurt a Democrat or Republican; it doesn't hurt one individual Member or another. It hurts us all collectively if we fail to give ourselves the best opportunity to show the American people not only are we doing the American people's work, we are doing it based on merit. We are doing it based on a system that is  fully ethical, and we don't take this as a burden. We take it as a necessary responsibility, and we understand that not only are we doing the people's business, but we are in a real sense on a stage which requires us to be teachers for many people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many young people look at this place and many young people have the opportunity to visit here, and many young people have the opportunity to see our workings here by way of C-SPAN, and I don't want them to be watching in the well of the House as we condemn a Member, as we expel a Member, or we reprimand a Member for inappropriate conduct, and have that Member stand here and say: if only you had given me the resources so I would have known what the rules really were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want that to be the excuse. I want us to say that we stand here as an ethical, collective body, and that we will put our money where our mouth is. I would just end by saying this: we would not allow a corporation to say they couldn't comply with Sarbanes-Oxley and the new responsibilities under ethics and reporting because they couldn't afford to hire the lawyers and the accountants to do it. We would say that was your obligation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we believe that is the obligation in the private sector, we ought to do the very same for ourselves as we stand here in the largest corporation in the world. As the members of the board of directors of the largest corporation in the world that spends more money in the world, we stand here saying we will be as serious about our responsibilities as we expect you to be about yours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I agree with Mr. Daniel E. Lungren that we need to take another look at perhaps supplemental funding, and we welcome that thought and we will pursue that, Mr. Daniel E. Lungren, because there is no Member of this House who doesn't want to make sure that the voices of the American people last year will not be taken seriously and will be heard and responded to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so very happy, Mr. Speaker, that the chairwoman on the Committee on Standards and the Ethics Committee came to the floor during the rules deliberation, and she stated that while she would want additional funding, she will guarantee us that that committee will work effectively and efficiently to provide the type of service that is necessary to make sure that the Ethics Committee gives us what it wants us to have. And she said that the best standards of ethics will still be maintained irrespective  of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Daniel E. Lungren did say we need an extra million dollars. If you look at this, there is a possibility that half a million per session each year would perhaps be the type of funding that we need. If that is the case, Mr. Speaker, the supplemental expense resolution pursuant to House rule X for additional funding is where we will pursue that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman, but we are complying with, and the Ethics Committee chairwoman said that there will still be maintained, the highest level of standards, and they will do their work efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time to conclude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to make a few comments about some of the points raised by the members of the committee on our side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I voted for this resolution as it came out of committee, without any dissent, because I thought we had done the best job we could, with both parties working together, to fairly distribute the limited funds that we had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is upsetting our side of the aisle and upsetting a number of individuals are two things: first, the select committee apportionment. I can assure you I am not opposed to forming the Energy Independence and Global Warming Select Committee. It is a major issue, a major topic, which probably has to be studied by a special task force, a select committee, simply because the issue is so complex and cuts across so many committees' jurisdictions that this is the only way to effectively conduct the  study and come to an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do, however, strongly object to the process of adding this huge amount of money, $3.7 million, in the confines of the Rules Committee. That is something that I had hoped and expected would come to our Committee on House Administration so that the Chair of the committee and I could work on this issue with all of the parties involved and ascertain the needs of the select committee and determine the precise allocation needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What particularly angers me about this is that we did not fully fund the Ethics Committee at the level it should be funded. The reason was we simply didn't have the money. Now, suddenly, there is an extra $3.7 million. I would have much preferred to allocate part of that to the Ethics Committee and reduce the amount for the select committee. I am sure they would not have noticed the difference, whereas the Ethics Committee would notice a huge difference and would be able to do its work effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With those caveats, I want to express my disappointments with the process, not within our committee, but the process outside our committee. I wish it would have gone through our committee, and we would have dealt with it properly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My final comment is simply to say most Members of Congress do not realize what an incredible amount of work goes into this budget process. It took our committee a full day just to hear the testimony, but that was the easy part. The tough part is for the staff to assemble all of the numbers and get them in order, particularly when there is a transition from one party to the other. That adds complexity and difficulty to the task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Peter Sloan and George Hadijski from our side of the aisle, who did an excellent, an outstanding job on this issue. But even though normally one only praises the  people on their own side of the aisle, I want to take special note of some individuals who worked very, very hard on the majority side, simply because their job was monumental having to do it for the first time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly want to commend Charlie Howell, Janelle Hu and Matt Pinkus for their hard work. They worked closely with our team, and we were very happy to help them. But I can't emphasize enough what a horrendous task this is to put together all these budgets very quickly, and both sides did yeomen's work. I am very pleased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think they set a pattern for the committee because they worked so closely together on this, both parties equally shouldering the burden and not worrying about how many hours they were spending on whose job; and I think that is a good pattern for us to follow for the next 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join with the ranking member again in thanking him for his forbearance during that very strenuous hearing process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also join him in thanking the staff: Charlie Howell, who is just an extraordinarily effective person, and who worked very hard with me to make sure that all of the very thick material that was needed for this process of hearings was available. And also Matt Pinkus, Janelle Hu and Kristin McCowan, who all played an extraordinary part in making sure that the process went smoothly, although it was very long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the minority staff because together they worked very well with the staff to ensure that this process went as smoothly as it could. So I thank all of these folks and the ranking member and all of the members of the committee, the Chairs and the ranking members of all committees, for bearing with us in a tightly budgeted Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that our resolution satisfies no one; however, I also know that when legislative and oversight agendas are set, they will be set with a keen eye to how to best use available funds. I want to assure all Chairs and ranking members that my committee will consider all requests for supplemental funding based upon whether or not additional funds are made available to the House. Right now, however, we must all live within our flatline budget constraints because, after all, there was no budget  passed last year in the 109th Congress, and we are operating under a continuing resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the American people have spoken. They spoke last year, and the Congress must respond to their demands. We all serve as trustees for their voices and their dollars, and I know that each committee will use the funds entrusted to it wisely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This committee recognizes that each standing committee carefully assessed its anticipated workload and requested only the sums it considered necessary to discharge its responsibilities. Nonetheless, with severely limited resources, the across-the-board inflationary adjustments share the pain equally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution has the lowest overall committee expenditure authorization level in the last three Congresses, even including the new select committee. At $280 million for the entire 110th Congress, it is an overall decrease of approximately 2 percent, Mr. Speaker. And that is a reversal for which this House should take credit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400396" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly commend Speaker Pelosi for showing tremendous leadership on this issue and creating the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. This committee will provide Congress the opportunity to conduct important and essential oversight that is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remain deeply concerned about global warming and have been appalled by the Bush Administration's failure to provide any leadership on one of the most important environmental, economic, and moral issues of our time. As the largest producer of greenhouse gasses in the world, the United States must enact national emissions controls to curb our country's contribution to global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>European Union leaders are meeting this week to consider plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by the year 2020, a first step in a post-Kyoto global warming strategy that could lead to mandatory limits for cars and pollution allowances for airlines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these actions are critical, the United States needs to lead in this area as Speaker Pelosi is working to achieve. It is high time for the Bush administration to stop questioning the science behind global warming and act to protect future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary General of the United Nations stated this week that "the danger posed by war to all of humanity--and to our planet--is at least matched by the climate crisis and global warming."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Representative of California, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Safe Climate Act, which was introduced last year and will be offered again this year. The goal of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Safe Climate Act is to reach 1990 emissions levels by 2020 and then to continue to cut emissions through 2050.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to achieve these cuts, the Environmental Protection Agency would be instructed to set national standards for vehicle emissions at the levels mandated by California state law, which has the strictest vehicle emissions laws in the country. By focusing on an increased use of renewable energy and allowing the nation's largest polluters to meet new federal standards by buying and selling emissions allowances, the Safe Climate Act sets out effective common-sense energy policies that will reduce  the United States' dependence on foreign oil while actively addressing global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I praise Speaker Pelosi for drawing attention to this important issue and working toward a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support the passage of the Committee Funding Resolution for the 110th Congress and the authorization for the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
