    <paragraph>Mr. President, on the first cloture vote dealing with prescription drugs, I think probably I have said enough to indicate my displeasure and disappointment with what has happened this week, for our inability to proceed on something that is so basic to the security of this Nation, the Intelligence authorization bill, which deals with our espionage efforts, our ability to collect intelligence from around the world. That was stopped on a strict party-line vote because the Vice President  didn't want that. So that is enough said on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the prescription drug issue, when all else fails I think we should look at common sense. What we are asking is that Medicare be able to negotiate for lower prices in the purchase of drugs for senior citizens. This is opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, the insurance industry, and HMOs because they have a sweetheart deal. They can negotiate for lower prices but Medicare can't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can throw around all the statistics you want, it is not going to lower prices. I call upon our common sense. Doesn't it make sense that Medicare should be able to compete with these HMOs and negotiate for lower price drugs? Of course. That is why AARP and dozens of other organizations that care about seniors, not about profits, are on the side of moving forward on this legislation. I hope there will be Senators on the other side of the aisle who will step up and allow us to move forward on  this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it is hard to comprehend, but in addition to not being able to move forward on the issues relating to intelligence, and probably on prescription drug negotiations, we have been  stymied in being able to bring forward a bill on court security. I hope it is just a small minority of Senators on the other side holding up this bill. We have had violence in courtrooms all over America. In Reno, NV, a disgruntled man did not like what a judge was doing  on a divorce proceeding. He drove to a garage with</paragraph>
    <paragraph>his high-powered, deer-hunting rifle and fired, at almost 200 yards, through the window of the judge's chambers. The shot did not kill him but badly wounded him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what happened in Atlanta, GA, with someone who was in cahoots, basically, with one of the violent prisoners. As a result of that, people were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Illinois, a disgruntled litigant waited in the judge's home, and when the father and one of the children came home, he killed them both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation dealing with court security is extremely important. We just had this terrible incident in Blacksburg, VA, indicating how prone this country is to violence. This legislation dealing with court security allows grants to States to beef up the security in courtrooms. It will allow bulletproof glass, as should have been in the judge's chambers in Reno, NV, and metal detectors. It would allow jurisdictions to obtain metal detectors. It would limit what Federal judges have to list in  their various personal papers. It would not be possible, if this legislation passes, for some disgruntled defendant, witness, or whatever the case might be, to go to the Internet and find out where the judge lives, as happened in Illinois. They would not have to disclose</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is important to allow us to better understand and protect against disgruntled litigants. It increases the penalties for people who do these bad things, who harass prosecutors, judges, and witnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very important legislation, and we should have already completed it. But here we are. We are going to have to move to proceed to it. Once--I hope--cloture is invoked, then we have 30 hours to wait before we get onto the bill. It would be a shame that we have to waste the time of our country, time that could be spent on valuable legislation that could be done here in this Chamber, waiting to move forward because of people not wanting to legislate.</paragraph>
