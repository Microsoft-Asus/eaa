  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO LADY BIRD JOHNSON -- (Senate - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9013">S9013</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, inside this desk is the name Johnson of Texas, majority leader. That, of course, is the signature of Lyndon Johnson, who was majority leader, Vice President of the United States, President of the United States. I have the honor of being able to work from this desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson is a legend from the great State of Texas, the Lone Star State. He was a Member of Congress, U.S. Senator, majority leader, Vice President, and the 36th President of the United States. But just as importantly, for those who know anything about Lyndon Johnson, were not these honors that were bestowed upon him by others but the fact that he married a wonderful woman, Lady Bird Johnson,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a name, Lady Bird Johnson. Anytime you read about Lyndon Johnson, you have to understand the power of his wife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Caro's book, "Master of the Senate," has a lot in it about Lady Bird Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife understands, I am sure, a little bit what she went through. In the book, it describes how he would bring people home with little notice for dinner, and it was always available. Mr. Rayburn, the Speaker, came to their home at least once a week for dinner, many times unannounced except by the President calling at the last minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, America has lost this great woman. The greatest asset Lyndon Johnson had was his wife. I join my colleagues and all Americans in tribute to this great American woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did not have the good fortune to know Lady Bird Johnson. She died today at age 94. But those who did know her said if you were to look up in the dictionary the term "lady," you would find Lady Bird Johnson's picture. She truly stereotyped a lady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is fair to say that you did not have to know Lady Bird Johnson--I did not--to admire her for the causes she championed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said briefly, I have my own special appreciation for Mrs. Johnson because I have some idea of what Landra, my wife, puts up with being married to the majority leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a domineering personality, her husband. She was, during all of the domination he had--with his poking Senators in the chest and the things he is now legendary to have done--she was always the same graceful woman no matter the situation she found herself in. She was the same person no matter what the situation. She served during challenging, extraordinary times. President Johnson went through some very difficult times. She was always at his side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She did not ask for the role of First Lady, but she embraced that role with grace and dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As First Lady, she was instrumental in the Highway Beautification Act, which came to be known as "Lady Bird's bill." She had many other initiatives that enhanced our natural world. She was a champion for children with programs such as Head Start. Later in life, her passion continued, most notably in her work opening the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center outside Austin, TX, where she will lie before reaching her final resting place at the Johnson family ranch in Stonewall, TX.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of no better tribute to Lady Bird Johnson than to close with her own words. She said once:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may wonder why I chose wildflowers when there is hunger and unemployment and the big bomb in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I, for one, think we will survive, and I hope that along the way we can keep alive our experience with the flowering earth. For the bounty of nature is also one of the deep needs of man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and warm feelings are with her two daughters, Lynda, whom I know quite well, and Luci, whom I know of, and, of course, Lynda's husband, our former colleague, Chuck Robb--who served with such dignity in the Senate; I had the good fortune of being able to serve with this wonderful Senator, great Governor of the State of Virginia, an extraordinary, gallant marine--and Ian, Luci's husband, and Lady Bird's many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom she loved as only a mother  and grandmother could love.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to say a word about Lady Bird Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had many graceful First Ladies in the United States, but Lady Bird Johnson can truly be said to have been the First Lady of America the Beautiful. Her husband used to joke that he would hear rustling in the hall at the White House. It would be, as he would say, Lady Bird and Lawrence Rockefeller meeting to work on conservation projects. Her legacy was the Highway Beautification Act of 1965. She understood that we have a great many important issues in our country but that one of our great  characteristics is the beauty of our country. Italy has its art, Egypt has its pyramids, and we have the great American outdoors. Lady Bird Johnson knew that for everybody--not just the wealthy with big homes and big lawns--the beauty of our country was something to preserve. She did that, and she changed our entire national attitude about its importance. She brought out the best in us in terms of appreciating the beauty of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I visited the Wild Flower Garden in Austin, TX, before. I have seen the blue bonnets there in the spring, and I have seen how she influenced the flowers to grow in the rights-of-way on Texas highways. They even adopted the motto in Texas "Don't mess with Texas." I am sure that is a legacy of Lady Bird Johnson as well. But not only did flowers begin to grow along the rights-of-way in Texas, they did in Tennessee and in a lot of other places--in States such as Colorado. Lady Bird Johnson has  made her mark in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our family had the privilege of knowing the Johnsons and especially Linda and Luci--Linda married to Chuck Robb, a former Senator. We were good friends. We spent many times together at Governors' conferences, and our children know one another. We express to Linda and Luci and that family our sympathies. We know they have great pride in their mother as well as their father. But we think of their mother tonight as we think of her as the First Lady of America the Beautiful and remember her contributions.</paragraph>
