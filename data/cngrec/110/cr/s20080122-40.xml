  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="STAFF SERGEANT SEAN M. GAUL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I salute a great American hero who has fallen in service to his country in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Army SSG Sean M. Gaul gave his life on January 9, 2008, after sustaining wounds when an improvised explosive device detonated while he was on patrol in Sinsil, Iraq, in the Diyala Province. He was serving his fifth deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. His loyalty and bravery will be remembered. My thoughts and prayers go out to Sean's family and friends,  especially to his wife Jessica and their young daughter, his mother Christine, and his father Michael.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sean Gaul lived in Cresco, IA, with his parents until the age of 7. He then moved to Reno, NV, with his mother. He attended Reed High School, where he was a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps. In 1997, he passed the GED exam. He was first deployed to Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Before deploying for the final time, he completed the Army's sniper school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Gaul's wife Jessica called him a "very good man and loving husband." She said, "He did not waiver from his responsibility. He always trained hard as he led the way by example. He was focused and determined as he sought out more special forces training." Again, my sincerest condolences go to his family and friends. I ask my colleagues here in the Senate and all Americans to remember with gratitude and appreciation a fine man and an exemplary solider, Army SSG Sean M. Gaul.</paragraph>
