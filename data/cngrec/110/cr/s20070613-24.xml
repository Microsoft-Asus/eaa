    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to express sorrow on behalf of the Somali community of Minnesota, which is currently mourning the death of an important figure for Somalia, former President Aden Abdulle Osman. Aden Abdulle Osman, known by many Somalis as Aden Adde, passed away at the age of 99 on June 7, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aden Abdulle Osman became the first President of Somalia in 1960 after the country gained its independence on July 1. Mr. Osman served as President of the newly formed Somalia until June 10, 1967. President Osman led his country during the critical time of its formation and development into a full-fledged state. When he lost the Presidential election in 1967, President Osman graciously ceded his position to his opponent, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke. In doing so, Aden Abdulle Osman set an example  for the peaceful transfer of democratic power, which is a critical aspect of all democratic systems. For this reason, Aden Abdulle Osman is viewed throughout Somalia and Africa as a model of statesmanship that seeks the greater good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am privileged to represent the State that has the largest Somali community in the U.S. The Somalis of Minnesota represent a thriving community that has enriched the fabric of our State through its vibrant culture. I would like to join my Somali constituents in expressing sorrow for Aden Abdulle Osman's death. It is my sincere hope that the current leaders of Somalia will look to his leadership as an example, and that such leadership will serve to usher Somalia towards peace, stability and democracy.</paragraph>
