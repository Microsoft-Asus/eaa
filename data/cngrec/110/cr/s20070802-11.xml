    <paragraph>Mr. President, I should have mentioned this. I appreciate very much my distinguished counterpart mentioning Senator Klobuchar and Senator Coleman. I listened to them being interviewed last night on television. You could tell from their presentations how much this meant to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AMY KLOBUCHAR's house is, I think, a mile from where the bridge collapsed. Today, they are where they should be. We have matters in the Senate, and we will certainly miss them. For example, Senator Klobuchar has been heavily involved in this ethics and lobbying reform measure. If there were ever a situation where they should miss votes, this is it.</paragraph>
