  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased tonight to come to the floor for a special order presentation. Let me start out by reading some names. Dr. William Thornton, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Charles Bulfinch, Thomas U. Walter, Edward Clark, Elliott Woods, David Lynn, J. George Stewart, George M. White, and Alan M. Hantman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, I read these names. They are the names of the 10 architects of the United States Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week will mark the last days in service to the United States Congress, and this historic structure, of the Architect of the United States Capitol, Alan M. Hantman. And I am pleased to rise this evening to recognize his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we have had many presidents, we have had many Speakers of the House. We have only had 10 architects who have been in charge of this incredible structure that we call our United States Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alan Hantman will leave his service, leaving a legacy untold by almost any of his predecessors. And it has been my honor and pleasure to work with him on a project that will dramatically change the nature of the United States Capitol, that is, the United States Capitol Visitors Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me reminisce for just a minute, as I thank him for his 10 years of dedicated and sometimes difficult and trying service to Congress. But let me reminisce, if I may, about Alan Hantman coming to serve as our United States Capitol architect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been involved in the Capitol Visitors Center for some 14 years, since I came to Congress, committed that the people who visit this institution should have the opportunity to have an enjoyable, informative and memorable visit to the United States Capitol. Instead, in the past, they have stood in the rain, snow, sleet, cold, ice, without even common comforts or courtesy in front of our most historic structure, and sometimes denied access to the structure or again common conveniences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was a little bit afraid because I know the way this place runs, when they were selecting an architect, some 10 years ago, that they might find someone in this process that would deep six the project, so I spent a particular amount of time as author of two authorization measures for the project, talking to Alan Hantman, and I was convinced he was the right person at the right time in the history of the United States Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He undertook that expansion of the United States Capitol Building, the largest in history. It will increase the volume, the sheer volume of the Capitol by some 70 percent. And he has done an incredible job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, he has had to make this Capitol run. I often joked when I first came here that the U.S. Capitol was run like a southern plantation with bad management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alan Hantman changed that. He brought professionalism to his position and to service and to, again, to the most monumental project, not on behalf of those who serve here. The Capitol Visitor Center, in fact, is the first structure and expansion to the Capitol in the history of the Capitol for the public, for those who own the place and to make, again, their visit an enjoyable, informative and educational experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alan brought with him great experience from the private sector with more than 10 years heading up the Rockefeller Center Management Corporation  in New York City, overseeing that great project, and then coming here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know he has had 535 bosses, a smaller group of Capitol preservation on which I serve, and then the leaders of the House and Senate and some of the appropriators and other authorizers. I call him working for 19 prima donnas. But he has completed the structure, planning, and under the most difficult circumstances you can imagine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When people see the Visitor Center, the name of Alan Hantman will live forever in the history of the United States Congress and our country.</paragraph>
