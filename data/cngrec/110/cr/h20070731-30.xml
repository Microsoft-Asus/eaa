    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's talk about some of the good news coming out of Iraq. I realize the Democratic majority would like to spend most of our time talking about failure in Iraq. Indeed, that is what we have done during the first 7 months of Congress. However, the new strategy in Iraq and the new general in charge are making real progress on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraqi people are beginning to stand up for the safety and security of their neighborhoods. A recent story in the Times of London states the increased presence of U.S. forces in the Doura neighborhood in South Baghdad, "is encouraging insiders to overcome their fear and divulge what they know. Convoys of U.S. soldiers are working the rubble-strewn streets day and night, knocking on doors, speaking to locals and following up on leads on possible insurgent hideouts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we owe it to the members of the Armed Forces who have given their lives, we owe it to the Iraqi people, to give this new strategy a chance to succeed, and we need to talk about their successes.</paragraph>
