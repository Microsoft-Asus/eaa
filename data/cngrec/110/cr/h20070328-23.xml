    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to recognize and celebrate the 80th birthday of C&amp;#233;sar E. Ch&amp;#225;vez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez was born in Yuma, Arizona, and grew up in migrant labor camps, into the poverty of the migrant worker's life. He became an historical figure who embodied humility and extraordinary strength during his peaceful struggle towards social justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was an individual who represented the ones who had less and had no representation whatsoever. He dedicated his entire life to tirelessly championing the rights of the farm laborers; and along with him was Dolores Huerta, also founder of the United Farm Workers union, fighting for better wages and conditions for those individuals that pick our fruit and feed our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez has been an extraordinary icon in my home State of Texas. In San Antonio, we honor his legacy during the annual C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez march to recognize those individuals that labor picking up our food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, we cannot travel anywhere in the United States without seeing a town or street named after this amazing individual. We in San Antonio, Texas, have C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez Boulevard as well as others throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that his legacy will continue to remain, and I rise today to encourage my colleagues, urging the President and the Congress to establish a national holiday for C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez and encourage them to support <bill type="hr" number="76">H. Res. 76</bill>.</paragraph>
