  <narrative>AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13865]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And SCHIP is prevention, as well as an important investment in our children and the future of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we don't make an adequate investment now to provide access to health care for our children, we will pay for it later. When is the White House going to get it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it must include all children. So let's not agree with the Republicans to put up barriers to doing that. Democrats opposed citizen documentation in Medicaid and we must oppose it now. It will hurt poor children and children who are racial and ethnic minorities, the children who need it most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The anti-immigrant rhetoric that is raising its ugly head in this body is hurting our country. We must not let it hurt our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not covering all poor legal immigrant children and requiring excess documentation is un-American. Let's end this today with SCHIP, and let's pass a bill that moves us closer to full coverage and to being the better country we ought to be.</paragraph>
