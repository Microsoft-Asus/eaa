    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a very disturbing report emerged from Iraq last week. According to press reports, medical students in Iraq will be denied diplomas even though they have completed all of the coursework and passed all of the required testing. This means that they would only be allowed to practice in Iraq, and no other country will accept their medical training or let them practice in the new country, even though they have met all of the requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This harkens back to the Iraq we knew under Saddam Hussein's rule. Saddam refused to grant diplomas to medical students in order to keep them in the country. Who would have thought that the new Iraq government would resort to Saddam Hussein's old tricks? This is an alarming and troubling trend, and it should be reversed immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While dozens of international medical relief organizations have been forced to leave Iraq because of serious security concerns, Iraqis have fewer and fewer medical professionals available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A well-known organization, Doctors Without Borders, related the story of one doctor, Dr. Bassam. He is an Iraqi physician specializing in orthopedic surgery living with his family in Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His story says: Now, security issues have top priority for the few existing financial resources, and medical needs are forced to take a back seat. This morning, dozens of people were killed in Fallujah. Yesterday, it was Baghdad. And that's not counting the wounded, who add to the long list of emergency cases packing the hospitals. Every day brings a new batch of dead and wounded. In this context, patients simply cannot receive proper treatment from an increasingly overwhelmed health care system.  Some are forced to sell their car, or even their house, to get certain kinds of care in the few hospitals able to provide it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the end of his story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, instead of locking people in against their will, the Iraqi government ought to be working with the international community to make Iraq a safe and prosperous place where people want to raise their families, where they want to stay, where they want to put down roots and contribute to the local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this is going to happen, the United States must dedicate our energies to bringing our troops home and to working with the Iraqi people to stabilize their infrastructure and social programs, programs that will provide health care, education and jobs. These are the most important needs for the Iraqis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time, Mr. Speaker, to bring our troops home. It is time to provide a future of hope for the Iraqi people.</paragraph>
