  <narrative>BUSH CONTINUES TO OPPOSE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THE UNINSURED -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2865]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is National Cover the Uninsured Week. This recognition is particularly important this year as our economy continues to dip into recession. The Kaiser Family Foundation recently released a study that shows each time the unemployment rate increases by one percentage point, an additional 600,000 children lose their insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has worked hard to ensure that our children have access to health care coverage through the CHIP program. In strong bipartisan votes, this Congress has repeatedly sent President Bush legislation that would provide 10 million children quality health care coverage, but repeatedly, he vetoed the legislation and prevented us from reaching more children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is even more important today as more Americans are losing their jobs and their health care, and yet President Bush and most Republicans in this Chamber refuse to ensure that 10 million children have access to quality health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we recognize the uninsured this week, I once again urge President Bush to reconsider his veto of the CHIP bill.</paragraph>
