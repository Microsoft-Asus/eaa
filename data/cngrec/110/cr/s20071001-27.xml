    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to recognize my friend and fellow Coloradan Jim Nicholson. Although it is with sadness that his resignation takes effect this week, I would like to take this time to commend him for his service as the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim is a veteran's veteran. As a West Point graduate, Army Ranger, highly decorated Vietnam war veteran, and 4 years of service as the ambassador to the Holy See, Jim was well prepared and highly qualified for the duties as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Jim was nominated by President Bush to serve as Secretary in December of 2004 and was subsequently confirmed unanimously by the Senate. The confidence bestowed upon Jim Nicholson by the President and all of those who gather here speaks to  his unassailable ability to assist our veterans. Sworn into office on February 1, 2004, Jim readily assumed his role as the primary advocate for veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim accepted control of the VA at an extremely difficult time and has proven himself to be the right man for the  job. He was asked to serve his country in a new capacity and brought with him a great sense of honor and duty. In this time of war, Jim has worked tirelessly to ensure that the VA meet the current needs of those veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Although there is great urgency in caring for our recently wounded service men and  women, Jim has also understood the crucial need to continue to provide the utmost care for our veterans and warriors of past generations. Under his leadership, the VA has earned higher marks for medical services than the private health care industry for customer satisfaction, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, for the seventh consecutive year. He has helped to give all our veterans the care they deserve, as they have sacrificed so much for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have personally worked with Jim for years. I would especially like to thank him for the instrumental role he played in reinvigorating the construction of a new VA hospital in Aurora on the Fitzsimons campus. Without his support, this project would not have progressed to the point it is at today. This hospital will prove to be a great asset for our veterans in Colorado, and Secretary Nicholson should be commended for his efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate the service of Secretary Nicholson, I had also like to take this opportunity to thank his family, notably his wife Suzanne, whose endless support is undoubtedly valued and is greatly appreciated. Jim Nicholson has served this country with honor and valor in many capacities. I will certainly miss Secretary Nicholson, and wish him and his family the best of luck in the future. I thank him for his exceptional service on behalf of all our veterans.</paragraph>
