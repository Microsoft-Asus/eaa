  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Bastrop County, Texas, there is a new sheriff in town. Over a dozen candidates were interviewed, and at the end, the last man standing was a woman. Becoming the third female sheriff in Texas, Rosanna Abreo became the first female sheriff in county history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rosanna is anything but an ordinary candidate. She has 17 years of experience in Texas law enforcement. Throughout her law enforcement career, she served at the Lubbock Police Department in west Texas and the Texas Department of Public Safety, where she served as a State trooper, a special crimes investigator, and a member of the DPS SWAT team, rising to the rank of lieutenant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Texas lawwoman is educationally accomplished as well, achieving a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and now a law degree, having passed the bar exam last May. Criminals and outlaws should be aware of this new Texas sheriff that is the enforcer of the law in her county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I congratulate Sheriff Abreo on her sound dedication to public safety, making her a role model for all peace officers in our State. Texas is proud of its new Lone Star sheriff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
