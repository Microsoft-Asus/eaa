    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning there will be a period of morning business for 60 minutes, Republicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the last portion of the time. Following the period of morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="378">S. 378</bill>, the court security legislation. Cloture was filed on the bill. Members have until 1 p.m. today to file any first-degree amendments to the matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident and I am hopeful that we will finish that bill today and be able to move, either this evening or tomorrow, to the matter dealing with competitiveness. Everyone should be made aware of the fact that we have at least 50 cosponsors of that legislation, so there will be no cloture filed to move to it or after we are on it. This is a bill that we should be able to complete without any procedural blocks of any kind from either side. But we are going to finish the court security bill  before we leave this week. That may take a little extra time, but I think it is something we all need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coincidentally, yesterday, as I indicated on the Senate floor, the head of the Marshals Service, Mr. Clark, came to see me. The meeting had been long since scheduled. It was not scheduled as a result of this matter being on the floor of the Senate. He indicated that violence against Federal judges was up 17 percent last year; that there were more than 1,000 open threats against members of the Federal judiciary last year. This does not take into consideration the many instances of threats and  actual violence in the State courts. This legislation will not only make safer the people who work in the Federal courts, including the judges, but also has the ability to make our State courts safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need not be reminded too often of what has happened in recent years. In Illinois, a crazed litigant waited in a judge's home. When the family came home--not the judge, just the family members--they were killed. In Nevada, a man who was dissatisfied with what a judge was doing shot the judge. We know what happened in Georgia, where violence took place and people were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something we really need to do. Time is of the essence. I understand there are some amendments today, and that is fine. We will dispose of those just as quickly as we can. I hope we do not have to file cloture on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the next thing. I appreciate very much the Republican leader doing what was necessary so we could move to the bill immediately after cloture was invoked on the motion to proceed. This is important legislation, and we should finish it as quickly as we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to acknowledge that all Judiciary Committee members are tied up in the Judiciary Committee today, Democrats and Republicans, because Attorney General Gonzales is appearing before them in his much anticipated hearing. As a result of that, we didn't have a manager of the bill. Sherrod Brown, a longtime Member of the House and new Member of the Senate, has agreed to manage this bill, and that will be done on this side. There are no excuses. We need to move forward. We have a  manager. We will make sure everything is done in an appropriate manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope anyone who has amendments to offer will do so. There is nothing pending at this time, as I understand it. I say to the Chair, is that true, that this bill is open to amendment at the present time?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>The bill is open to amendment. We hope if people, Democrats or Republicans, think this bill can be improved, they will offer amendments.</paragraph>
