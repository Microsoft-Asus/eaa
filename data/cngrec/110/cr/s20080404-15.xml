  <narrative>HONORING DR. PHILIP MASON -- (Senate - April 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2611">S2611</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my pleasure to recognize the efforts of Dr. Philip P. Mason, widely regarded as one of Michigan's most distinguished living historians, on the opening of the 50th Annual Conference on Local History; "Michigan in Perspective." This conference, which Dr. Mason founded in 1958 and continued to organize and nurture for a half century, is one of our Nation's most outstanding historical gatherings, appealing to historians of all ranks. Dr. Mason's efforts throughout  the years to preserve, promote, and facilitate the use of historical records is, indeed, an important endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Mason graduated from Boston University with a degree in liberal arts in 1951, and subsequently moved to Michigan to pursue a master's, and ultimately a doctorate, in history from the University of Michigan. While at the University of Michigan, he served as Michigan's State Archivist from 1953 to 1958.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1958, Dr. Mason launched a long and distinguished career at Wayne State University as a professor of history. That same year, he founded the Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs and served as its director until he retired in 1992 to return to teaching. By 1992, the Labor Archives had grown to become the official depository for the inactive records of nine international labor unions, including the United Auto Workers, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of State, County  and Municipal Employees, Airline Pilots, American Federation of Teachers, and the United Farm Workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The archives also preserved and made available to researchers the historical files of several thousand labor leaders, reformers, and prominent community leaders. In May 1975, the new Walter Reuther Library opened on the Wayne State University campus. By the end of his tenure as director, the library had become one of the major research centers in the world and an integral part of the research of hundreds of scholars, writers, film producers, and other researchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Mason was promoted to full professor in the department of history in 1966. He also became professor of library and information science in 1993 and his popular archives curriculum educated and inspired hundreds of young professional archivists. In 1990, Wayne State University named Dr. Mason a distinguished professor of history, a rank he retained until his retirement in 2006. Throughout his career, he received numerous awards, including the Alumni Faculty Service Award in 2005, the President's  Exceptional Service Award in 2001, and the Distinguished Graduate Faculty Award in 1985.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his career as an archivist, he assisted many institutions, including Penn State University, Georgia State University, the University of Texas at Austin, and San Francisco State University to establish their labor archives. He was the major consultant to the AFL-CIO in establishing the George Meany Archives at Silver Spring. He also assisted 15 other international unions to set up archives and records management programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Mason played an active role as a member of at least seven professional societies ranging from the American Association of State and Local History to the Michigan Historical Society. From 1986 to the present he served as co-editor of Wayne State's award-winning Great Lakes Books Series, and in 1992, he became the editor of Michigan State University Press' Henry R. Schoolcraft series. He authored or coauthored eight books including "Rum Running and the Roaring Twenties," 1995, "The Ambassador  Bridge," 1987, and Tracy W. McGregor: Humanitarian, Philanthropist and Detroit Civic Leader," 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to authoring and contributing to numerous other articles and television series, Dr. Mason has traveled for decades giving popular presentations that broaden the appreciation of Michiganders of their colorful Michigan heritage. And, along the way, Dr. Phil Mason has selflessly befriended, assisted, and inspired hundreds of young scholars to carve out careers in local history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues join me in honoring Dr. Philip Mason. I wish him continued success in the years ahead.</paragraph>
