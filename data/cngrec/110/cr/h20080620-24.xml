  <narrative>GAS PRICES: AN ENERGY AND ECONOMIC CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5776]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BURTON of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Speaker, another week has gone by, and the American people are paying over $4 a gallon for gasoline, and it's going up because we're getting into vacation time. And we're going home. We're leaving this body. This Congress, our majority party, hasn't done one thing or hasn't even made an attempt to lower the gas prices in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the oil here in America. We have it off the Outer Continental Shelf and in Alaska at the ANWR. We have coal shale. We can develop it. We can get oil to the market within 2 or 3 years if we could lower the price of oil immediately once we address the issue because competition around the world will see we're going to drill for oil, and they will start lowering the price, and gas prices will come down, but we have to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we go with one more week. We're going home with nothing having been done, and the people of this country continue to pay these exorbitant prices for gasoline at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, if I were talking to the American people, I would just say to them today: Contact your Congressman, contact your Senator, and tell them you want something done quickly because this is not only an energy crisis; it's an economic crisis.</paragraph>
