  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a week ago, the anti-war rally in Washington made headlines across America. Lost in most of the coverage, however, was the complete lack of basic decency displayed by some of these protesters. The anti-war protesters defaced our Capitol by spray-painting graffiti on the Capitol's west terrace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it never ceases to amaze me how nonpeaceful these so-called peace protesters can be. There is no question that Americans have a constitutional right to peaceably assemble, but when you brazenly deface cherished public property, you are no longer assembling peacefully. You are committing a crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we can have a thoughtful public debate on our policies overseas, but we must remember this. Our freedom was not earned by protesters with poster paint. It was earned by the thousands of brave men and women who courageously stand up to fight for it, many of whom paid with their lives.</paragraph>
