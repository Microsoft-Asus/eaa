  <narrative>WORLD AIDS DAY -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14136]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to join with my colleagues as we take this time to highlight the gravity of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and especially as it affects people of color throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Centers for Disease Control, the CDC, reported that approximately 1 million Americans were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2003, roughly 25 percent of whom were undiagnosed and unaware of their HIV infection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An article in the New York Times this week noted that new HIV/AIDS case estimates are actually 50 percent higher than health experts had previously believed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this infection has started to increase among children at a drastic rate. Through 2005, there have been an estimated 9,000 AIDS cases reported for children under the age of 13. HIV/AIDS is becoming a problem earlier and earlier for more and more Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very clear that HIV/AIDS is indeed an emergency situation, especially in the African American community. According to the CDC, African Americans make up 13 percent of the Nation's population, but account for 49 percent of the estimated AIDS cases diagnosed since the epidemic began.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, African American children make up approximately 63 percent of the estimated HIV/AIDS cases through 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only are African Americans more likely to get AIDS; they're more likely to die from it, with more than half of all AIDS-related deaths being among African Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must get behind the World AIDS Day slogan, "Stop AIDS, keep the promise." We must increase funding for treatment and prevention, not reduce it by 91 percent, as this administration has done. We must invest in medical research and needle exchange programs, prevention and treatment. The more engaged we are and the stronger the determination we have, it will lead to the decrease in AIDS cases across the United States in all communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm pleased that in Chicago, a coalition of organizations, the City of Chicago Department of Public Health, the Illinois Department of Public Health, Malcolm X College, the 7th District HIV/AIDS Task Force, Walgreens drug stores, Ora Sure technologies, Abbott Laboratories, the Let's Talk Let's Test Foundation, Working Togetherness and other organizations, held 2 days of high-profile activity where there were many sites where people could come and be tested free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I commend the City of Chicago's Department of Public Health, the State of Illinois Department of Public Health, and all of those hardworking groups and organizations who are working to try and put at least a dent in this problem.</paragraph>
