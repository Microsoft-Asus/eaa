    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tax receipts are up, and the deficit is down. Pro-growth policies are working. The President's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 have had an enormous impact on our economy and on government revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Management and Budget announced today that the Federal deficit is actually $205 billion, the lowest since 2002, the lowest since the tax cuts went into effect. What this shows is that with pro-growth policies, the economy grows. And when the economy grows, tax receipts to the government go up as well. When that happens, we can balance this budget if we have the reasonable approach of restraining spending and keeping in place the tax cuts that were put in place in 2001 and 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to continue this pro-growth policy of keeping taxes low and helping the American economy grow and prosper.</paragraph>
