    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recall the exceptional life of Reverend Raymond Moss of Marietta, Georgia. Reverend Moss passed away this month at the age of 79, leaving behind a long legacy as an advocate of social justice and civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Moss was a fixture in Cobb County. After a brief stint in Minor League Baseball and a job as draftsman at Lockheed Martin, Moss found his true calling, and in 1959 he started Back to the Bible Holiness Church, the first homegrown Black church in Cobb County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to build 14 more churches in Georgia and Alabama, and helped lead the Cobb community during the turbulent civil rights era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Moss was a compassionate father not only to his own 14 children, but to any member of the Marietta community in need of a mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I first came to know the Reverend 30 years ago while practicing medicine with one of his dear friends, Dr. Douglas Glover. Indeed, many of Reverend Moss' faithful came to my office for care, and all had been deeply touched by the Reverend's compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know these members of our community will carry on his dedication to compassionate service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in honoring the life of Reverend Raymond Moss.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
