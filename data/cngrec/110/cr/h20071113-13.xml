    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill> is a bill to designate the great hall located in the Capitol Visitor Center as "Emancipation Hall." As we all know, the new Capitol Visitor Center is the most recent and largest addition to the United States Capitol in its 212-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The great hall will include information and ticketing desks and provide an area where Americans from across the country and where people from all over the world can gather to take in scenic views of the Capitol or prepare to tour the 580,000 square foot Visitor Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The great hall will also serve as a central gathering space in the Capitol Visitor Center. It encompasses 20,000 square feet and its dimensions are 100 feet by 200 feet, with a ceiling height of 35 feet. It is indeed a majestic addition to the Capitol. There will be statues from Statuary Hall on display throughout the great hall, if I may so, hopefully, finally, statues from the Capitol of the United States; the District of Columbia. The plaster model of the Statue of Freedom from the Senate  Russell building will be featured in the cellar rotunda. The wall and column stone in the great hall is sandstone from Pennsylvania. The floor stone is marble from Tennessee and dolomite from Wisconsin. The black granite in the water features of the great hall comes from California. It is remarkable and impressive as a public space befitting this Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, congressional leaders directed the Architect of the Capitol to produce a report on the history of slave labor in the construction of the Capitol itself. The completed 29-page report examined the efforts of slaves that helped build the Capitol, other Federal buildings, and the White House, which at the time was known as the President's House. Although the record was incomplete because of limited documentation of slave labor, the evidence available and historical context in the report  provided several indications that slaves and freed African Americans played a significant role in building the physical symbols and the Capitol itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill> was introduced to acknowledge the work of many who were forced to work on building the U.S. Capitol. On Wednesday, November 7, the congressional task force completed its work and included in its list of recommendations a specific recommendation to honor slaves who built the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am a third-generation Washingtonian. My great grandfather, Richard Holmes, was a runaway slave from a plantation in Virginia. He arrived here in the 1850s, and that's how our family began here. He was freed in a congressional emancipation 9 months before the Emancipation Proclamation. This emancipation was a Civil War emancipation bill issued earlier than the more famous Emancipation Proclamation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He worked on the streets of the capital. I have no evidence that he worked on the Capitol itself. Indeed, there was no mention of the work of slaves or African Americans on this Capitol even in official Capitol histories until recent decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Capitol has stood for 212 years without even acknowledging, in some small way, perhaps a marker, something to indicate that slaves, many of them quite skilled because they were hired out as "hired Negroes" in order to bring the greatest revenue to their slave owners, and therefore, it behooved him or her to hire out those Negro hires, as they were called, who could benefit the slave owner the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are nameless African Americans. Nothing in the Emancipation Hall and nothing that we do now will make us understand who they are. The very least we can do, if we are adding to this Capitol, is to finally acknowledge their work in building this extraordinary building that was called from its earliest beginnings, the Temple of Liberty, or perhaps now that we have founded the great hall, it will be more worthy of that name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I visited the center, I was very impressed by it; but in the early days of its construction, I asked, How are you going to commemorate the fact that slaves worked on the original Capitol? And there was something, along with many other historical remembrances, that did indicate that slaves had built or helped build the original Capitol, along with, of course, many working-class and skilled whites who participated in the effort. But that was going to be the sum total of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the difficulties may be, how do you do something so late in the history of our country that is large enough to encompass what we had not remembered for two centuries?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my judgment, there is no place, there is no marker, there is no piece of ground that can adequately, finally remember their contribution. And so we don't name a hall, we don't name a room, we don't have a statue. We say  enter this space. When you enter this space, it will be called Emancipation Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And in that way we will perhaps emancipate our Capitol from more than two centuries of ignoring the contribution of these slaves who helped build this majestic building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill> provides that the great hall of the Capitol Visitor Center be known as Emancipation Hall. The bill was introduced by Representative Zach Wamp of Tennessee on August 2, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At nearly 580,000 square feet, the Capitol Visitor Center is the largest project undertaken by the Office of the Architect of the Capitol in the Capitol's 212-year-old history. It is one of the most important projects since the extensions to the Capitol and the Dome were built more than 140 years ago. As an extension of the Capitol, the Capitol Visitor Center will welcome visitors to the seat of the American Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within the Capitol Visitor Center, the great hall is a large 20,000-square-foot room where visitors will gather as they enter the Capitol. This promising gathering space will serve as the gateway for the public's experience of the Capitol and American democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Capitol Visitor Center will provide visitors to the Capitol the opportunity to learn about and more fully understand the Constitution, the Congress, and the history of the Capitol, including the contribution of slaves who helped build the Capitol and the country. It will help deepen the understanding of all who visit about our Nation's long struggle with slavery and its ultimate abolition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting and appropriate to recognize the seminal moment of the Emancipation Proclamation in American history. We should recognize the sacrifice and contribution of the many slaves who helped build the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400198" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Let me express my great appreciation to the chairman and to the ranking member of this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we have come to this temple of democracy on this momentous occasion to write a new chapter in the unfolding story of human freedom. The event of emancipation marks one of the most if not the most significant event in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emancipation was more than an act; it was a process. Emancipation was not a date but a period. Emancipation was not an event but the fulfillment of providence that the arc of history may be long but it bends towards justice and human freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the American city war erupted, both North and South defended their causes as morally just, legally right, and constitutionally sound. Northerners and southerners saw themselves as the true Americans following in the tradition and the footsteps of the Founding Fathers. North and South used the Constitution as their source of moral and legal authority for conducting a war against each other. Both sides saw themselves as standing in the tradition of the American Revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each side contended that it was fighting for freedom and liberty, though certain facts contradicted the beliefs of both. The South said it was fighting to preserve the freedom, while owning slaves. The North said it was fighting for liberty, while not initially fighting to grant liberty to the slaves. President Abraham Lincoln's address to the Sanitary Fair in Baltimore on April 18, 1864, summed up the quandary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word, we do not mean the same thing. With some the word `liberty' may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labor. Here are two not only different but incompatible things called by the same name: liberty. And it follows that each of these things is, by their respective parties,  called by two different and incompatible names: liberty and tyranny."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today women, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgendered Americans, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and students see in the word "liberty" one thing. Today for the Titans of Industry, it still means quite another. For the disposed, it means for each person to do with himself as they please. For the Titans, it means for them to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labor anywhere in the world. As Lincoln said, "And it follows that each of the things is,  by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names: liberty and tyranny."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the efforts to name the great hall Liberty Hall will settle for some but still not settle for others the fundamental question of human freedom. For millions of Americans to pass through Emancipation Hall and not Liberty Hall is an important acknowledgment about the process for attaining human freedom in the American historical context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is most appropriate that the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Zach Wamp, offered this amendment, in conjunction with the gentleman from Illinois, to help establish a marker in the Capitol of the United States about the significant role that these Americans, these Africans, played in the process not only in constructing the temple of our democracy but in strengthening America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, it is probably most appropriate that the Emancipation Hall designation be established during this Thanksgiving period, as the first Thanksgiving established by proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln was during the American Civil War when President Lincoln, on October 3, 1863, looked out over a Nation torn by war, ravaged by internecine, intrafamily and interfamily struggles, and concluded that because of the extraordinary efforts of the North and the South, men and women who  thought their causes were just, that we needed a national day of thanks. And so on October 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln affixed to a national proclamation a national day of thanks to say thank you for now until eternity for all of the blessings that have been bestowed upon our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanksgiving has a lot less to do, Mr. Speaker, with Pilgrims in 1620 and much more to do with the emancipation of human freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln understood for his time and ours that we must not be confused about the language and process of human freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been said about Lincoln and his ambivalence about emancipation. I believe when placed in context greater clarity emerges in Lincoln's calculation of emancipation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1862, Lincoln's announced support of colonization, along with his lack of public support for emancipation, was generating sometimes vicious attacks from militant abolitionists, including a "Prayer for Twenty Millions" editorial urging emancipation that appeared in Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. On August 22, a month after the private announcement to his cabinet on July 22 that he intended to issue an Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln replied to Greeley's editorial with a masterfully  written open letter:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if  I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln was reiterating his central thesis, that the purpose of the war was preservation of the Union, but in light of the intransigence of the border States, he was publicly hinting that he might have to do something more, including emancipation, to save the Union. In this open letter, Lincoln was saying "if," but he had already concluded in his own mind "that" the only way to save the Union was to free the slaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the emancipation proposal became public, Lincoln was sometimes ridiculed in political oratory and newspaper editorials about  his Emancipation Proclamation, which would free the slaves only where the president had no power to do so--in the rebel southern States--but preserve the institution everywhere else. But Lincoln's enemies either misunderstood the president, lacked his understanding of the Constitution, or ignored his politics. On saving  the Union, Lincoln had additional flexibility under the Constitution. Politically, he could sometimes get away with violating it by engaging in arbitrary arrests and suspending the writ of habeas corpus. On the question of ending slavery, however, Lincoln saw no such flexibility. His understanding of the Constitution committed him to acting within both it and the law, for neither had yet been changed. Under the Constitution, slavery was still legal in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the first question, Lincoln and all Republicans agreed that a Thirteenth Amendment outlawing slavery must be added to the Constitution. The Senate quickly passed such an amendment, but the House--which had gained thirty-four Democrats in the 1862 midterm elections--was opposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln understood, if others didn't, that issuing the Emancipation Proclamation would convert a struggling Union army, trying to hold a Nation together, into a liberation army to free the slaves. The newly freed slaves could help win the struggle by fighting alongside the Union soldiers. Of course, the liberation of slaves would happen only if the North won the war. Militant abolitionists still thought the proclamation weak, southerners thought it an outrage, but most antislavery advocates,  both black and white, understood its revolutionary implications. It was the one act that changed the entire character of the war. It gave the war a moral purpose--human freedom--to bolster the political goal of saving the Union. And a purpose with such deep emotional power condemned the Confederacy to sure defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question now was, having transformed the conflict into a war of liberation, would the northern Union soldiers still fight? Some said no. "An Ohio Democrat amended the party's slogan to proclaim, `the Constitution as it is, the Union as it was, the Niggers where they are.' " But most said yes! "A Democratic private in the Army of the Potomac whose previous letters had railed against abolitionists and blacks now expressed support for `putting away any institution if by so doing it will put  down the rebellion, for I hold that nothing should stand in the way of the Union--niggers, nor anything else.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the July 4, 1863 victory at Gettysburg and Vicksburg northern hopes rose and southern spirits sank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The burial of the Gettysburg dead was originally planned for October 23 but rescheduled to November 19 because the principal orator, Edward Everett of Massachusetts, could not be ready before then. Lincoln, by comparison, was casually invited to attend and make a few remarks. "No insult was intended. Federal responsibility or participation was not assumed, then, in state activities. And Lincoln took no offense. Though specifically invited to deliver only `a few appropriate remarks' to open the  cemetery, he meant to use this opportunity. The partly mythical victory of Gettysburg was important to his administration's war propaganda."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are mythical accounts that Lincoln wrote his Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope. Even though the 272-word speech probably took less than three minutes to deliver--interrupted with applause five times by the twenty thousand in attendance--such cavalier preparation would have been totally uncharacteristic of Lincoln, who took such opportunities very seriously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln intended to use this occasion and speech to lift the Nation's eyes above the death and carnage of Gettysburg "to a level of abstraction that purges it of grosser matter ..... Lincoln did for the whole Civil War what he accomplished for the single battlefield." He transformed its meaning and in so doing transformed what it meant to be an American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln mentioned neither slavery nor Gettysburg. He drained his speech of all particulars in order to lift up an ideal. Lincoln intended to create something good and new out of this tragic and bloody episode. Both North and South strove to interpret Gettysburg to further their own war interests. Lincoln was after an even bigger victory--winning the ideological as well as the military war. And he succeeded. "The Civil War is, to most Americans, what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Words had to complete  the word of the guns."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we wave the flag and celebrate on July 4, Independence Day, we are not so much celebrating our American-ness in terms of our independence from England. We are celebrating the meaning of the flag and America as Lincoln interpreted them in his Gettysburg Address. At Gettysburg, Lincoln reinterpreted the Constitution. Looking past slavery in the Constitution, he appealed to the Declaration of Independence and its claim that "all men are created equal." Conservative political "heirs to his  outrage still attack Lincoln for subverting the Constitution at Gettysburg."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln is here not only to sweeten the air at Gettysburg, but to clear the infected atmosphere of American history itself, tainted with official sins and inherited guilt. He would cleanse the Constitution--not, as William Lloyd Garrison had, by burning an instrument that countenanced slavery. He altered the document from within, by appeal from its letter to the spirit, subtly changing the recalcitrant stuff that legal compromise, bringing it to its own indictment. By implicitly doing this, he  performed one of the most daring acts of open-air sleight-of-hand ever witnessed by the unsuspecting. Everyone in that vast throng of thousands was having his or her intellectual pocket picked. The crowd departed with a new thing in its ideological luggage, that new Constitution Lincoln</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was transforming the United States from a plural to a singular noun--from the United States are into the United States is a free government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Garry Wills, Lincoln, by his words and action, converted the Union from a mystical hope into a constitutional reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 4, 1776--only white men could vote; July 4, 1863--Gettysburg; July 4, 2007: Barack Obama, an African American, Hillary Clinton, a woman, Mitt Romney, a Mormon, All are candidates for President; America and what it means to be an American today will not be the same definition of what it means to be an American tomorrow. We are all part of the Emancipation process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bit of trivia, when was the first Thanksgiving? 1620. Why? Landing of Plymouth Rock. Interesting, because the first slaves arrived in Jamestown in 1619.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November 1863, Abraham Lincoln looked out over a Nation ravaged by war, internecine warfare, intra and inter family feuding, and saw light at the end of the tunnel for Northern victory and proclaimed the 3rd Thursday in November as a national day of thanks. Proclamation of Thanksgiving:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WASHINGTON, DC,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>October 3, 1863.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the proclamation which set the precedent for America's national day of Thanksgiving. During his administration, President Lincoln issued many orders like this. For example, on November 28, 1861, he ordered government departments closed for a local day of thanksgiving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sarah Josepha Hale, a prominent magazine editor, wrote a letter to Lincoln on November 28, 1863, urging him to have the "day of our annual Thanksgiving made a National and fixed Union Festival. " She wrote, "You may have observed that, for some years past, there has been an increasing interest felt in our land to have the Thanksgiving held on the same day, in all the States; it now needs National recognition and authoritive fixation, only, to become permanently, an American custom and institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to an April 1, 1864, letter from John Nicolay, one of President Lincoln's secretaries, this document was written by Secretary of State William Seward, and the original was in his handwriting. On October 3, 1863, fellow Cabinet member Gideon Welles recorded in his diary that he complimented Seward on his work. A year later the manuscript was sold to benefit Union troops.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>A Proclamation</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity,  which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence, have not arrested the plough, the shuttle or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consiousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Done at the city of Washington, this third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty-eighth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the President: Abraham Lincoln.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William H. Seward,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question for contemporary American memory is why would we appropriate the memory for Thanksgiving as "Plymouth Rock" an event that has its formation in quite a different story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same can be said for the story of our capitol. From the moment a visitor enters this building the unfolding process of emancipation, the players in this drama, the actors, the people, the heroes and the sheroes have been hidden, denied a fair and accurate account of these unfolding events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rotunda: Story of America from pilgrims to the Wright Brothers. Not a story of America; Statuary Hall: Emancipation is ignored in Statuary Hall as we count among our honored dead Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Confederate Vice President Alexander Hamilton Stephens, Confederate General Robert E. Lee, and Confederate Commander Joseph Wheeler--still in uniform; Rather than discuss this history we reduce the story of this Nation to acoustics; Old Senate Chamber: Charles Sumner, Preston Brooks,  Plessy v. Ferguson; Old Supreme Court Chamber: Dred Scott, Amistad Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the emancipation process that led to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. And as descendants of Slaves we believe that as Americans are better educated on this history that process will lead to our twenty-eighth amendment, our twenty-ninth and thirtieth: Health care for all; Education of equal and high quality for all; Cleaner environment; Fix our Nation's voting system; Provide equality for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our Nation's historical process and only that process can provide emancipation for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interpreting Lincoln's life and work is extremely important. Recently there have been questions raised as to whether Lincoln should be credited with freeing the slaves. The argument goes: Given some of Lincoln's history, his racial attitudes and stalemates, his moderate views on the subject, his noninterference with slavery where it already existed, his one proposed solution of colonization, his gradualist approach to ending the institution, his hesitancy with respect to issuing the Emancipation  Proclamation and using colored troops in the war, his late conversion to limited voting rights for blacks, and more, why should he be given credit with freeing the slaves? Some have even argued that it was various actions taken by the slaves--including the power given to the Union cause as a result of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, just as the Congress and Lyndon Johnson would not have been able to pass and sign the civil rights and social legislation of the 1960s apart from a modern civil and human rights movement, so too the military commanders, the Congress, and Lincoln would not have been able to achieve what they did without the agitation and movement of the slaves and their allies. On the other hand, the slaves would not have become freedmen apart from what these leaders did. Because historical interpretation  has played up the role of white male leaders while playing down the role of mass movements and leaders of color and women, our understanding of history has been skewed. Some of the current "putdown" of traditional historical interpretation is legitimate rejection and reaction to his past limited and distorted understanding</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To answer this question James M. McPherson says in Drawn With the Sword that we must first ask: What was "the essential condition, the one thing without which it would not have happened? The clear answer is the war." Slavery had existed for nearly two and a half centuries, it was more deeply entrenched in the South than ever, and every effort at self-emancipation--and there were plenty--had failed. "Without the Civil War there would have been no confiscation act, no Emancipation Proclamation,  no Thirteenth Amendment (not to mention the Fourteenth and Fifteenth) ..... and almost certainly no end of slavery for several more decades at least."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As to the first question, what brought on the war, there are two interrelated answers. What brought on the war was slavery. What triggered the war was disunion over the issue of slavery. Disunion resulted because initially seven and ultimately eleven southern States saw Lincoln as an antislavery advocate and candidate, running in an antislavery party on an antislavery platform, who would be an antislavery president. Rather than abide such a "Black President" and "Black Republican Party,"  southern States led by the Democratic Party severed their ties to the Union. Through secession, which Lincoln and the Union refused to accept, they went to war over preserving the Union. While Lincoln was willing to allow slavery to stand where it stood from 1854 when he reentered politics onward,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, while Lincoln's primary emphasis throughout was on saving the Union, the result of saving the Union was emancipation for the slaves. If the Union has not been preserved, slavery would not have been ended and may even have been strengthened. Strategically, Lincoln understood that the Union was a common-ground issue around which he could rally the American people, while slavery and antislavery were divisive. And looked at in perspective, by holding his coalition together around the issue  of the Union, enough Unionists eventually saw the connection between the two issues that he could ease into emancipation in the middle of the war--when it gave the North a huge boost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even when Lincoln believed he was going to lose the presidency in August 1864, he said, "There have been men who proposed to me to return to slavery the black warriors" who had fought for the Union. `I should be damned in time and eternity for so doing. The world shall know that I will keep my faith to friends and enemies, come what will ..... In effect, he was saying that he would rather be right than president ..... As matters turned out ..... he was both right and president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, many slaves did self-emancipate through the Underground Railroad before the war, and through flight during the war. Even so, that is not the same as bringing an end to the peculiar institution of slavery, which only the Civil War and Lincoln's leadership did. By pronouncing slavery a moral evil that must come to an end and then winning the presidency in 1860, provoking the South to secede, by refusing to compromise on the issue of slavery's expansion or no Fort Sumter, by careful leadership  and timing that kept a fragile Union.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Some of the stories that I have learned about as I share them just send chills up and down my spine. To think that there were 4,000 Union troops during the Civil War stationed on Capitol Hill, that 4,000 troops were here at the Capitol during the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when you go up inside of the Dome, the magnificent Dome, which around the world is the beacon of freedom, the symbol of hope, recognizable everywhere in this world, you go up inside of it, and you ask what the little hooks are hanging there, and they will tell you that is where they hung the lanterns when Union soldiers would work side by side with slaves to build that Rotunda in the depths of the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a fact that few people know because, as Ms. Norton said, the story was never told. It was never archived, the incredible commitment and the irony of the people fighting for the slaves' freedom were working side by side during the Civil War to build this temple of freedom. All the history books point out that that is one great and grave omission in the Capitol history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A guy named Oz Guiness once told me that the power to convene is greater than the power to legislate. And we convene here in the Capitol, people from all over the world, for good causes. The floor space of the Rotunda, which is the most prominent room in Capitol, is about 7,500 square feet. As Ms. Norton said, the floor space of this new hall, which has been called the great hall, is almost three times that size. It's a magnificent space designed to bring all of the visitors there to  convene them before they enter this temple of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to answer the question why not the Great Hall, because it has been referred to as the great hall. But the Great Hall for over 100 years is the foyer, the Great Hall, at the Library of Congress in the Jefferson building. It is one of the most ornate spaces in the United States of America. I think it is the most beautiful room in Washington, D.C. And it is called the Great Hall. The Librarian of Congress told us, as soon a I became the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Appropriations  Subcommittee in January, that this was a conflict because the CVC construction adds a tunnel between the Great Hall and the great hall. On two sides of the tunnel is going to be two great halls. Are you kidding me? How did we do that? That's confusing. That's problematic. That</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emancipation brings us all together at a time in this country where we need things to bring us together. This is a way to honor this incredible process that led to an event that liberated all people in this country under our Constitution, not just some. And it was Abraham Lincoln who was the great emancipator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So our parties come together today, and I ask the House to join us in this most important naming. It is important what you name things. It's important what we name each other. It's important what we call things. It's important what we call each other. Words matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emancipation liberates us today, the thought of Emancipation Hall, the largest and most prominent room in this 580,000-square-foot addition to the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Come together, House of Representatives. Come together, United States Senate. Let us send the message to all who come to this temple of freedom that emancipation lives on. And with such an important moment in the learning process of this experiment in freedom and democracy known as the American Republic, let's come together today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is so true that slavery was an abomination and is even today an abomination. It was a blight on this country's collective soul, and we can thank God that it has been eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emancipation Hall, it does have a great ring to it. It sounds beautiful and it sounds like it's high time that such a hall were so named, and it does sound like an appropriate hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I go back, though, and think through the comments and the speeches of those who were able to get rid of this abomination in this country, I think about the reasoning they had. Some have said that if there is no universal standard of right and wrong, if there is no force in the universe beyond ourselves that is unwavering as to right and wrong, then people can treat others the way they wish. If we are each god in our own way, then we can treat each other as we wish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I believe, as those who fought so hard to eliminate slavery, that there is a universal standard of right and wrong, and that is the God that's referenced "In God We Trust."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as we look throughout the Congressional Visitor Center, we find the Emancipation Hall will be a great addition, but there ought to be a basis, some reference, so people know why the emancipation was so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Yet, as I understand it, the term "Creator," "we are endowed by a Creator with certain inalienable rights," that's nowhere in the hall; that's been eliminated. There is no reference to the Lord. The Constitution is dated in the year of our Lord in 1787. We find out a couple of weeks ago that "Laus Deo" that's on the capstone of the Washington Monument, meaning "praise be to God" has been obliterated and changed from the display so that people don't know what's up there. And the capstone  itself, the monument replica, is turned where people can't see it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are categorically removing God and references to Creator, to God, to Lord, from all of these things. And Lincoln, in his addresses, repeatedly said we pray to the same God, it's in his second inaugural address, and yet the efforts these days are to eliminate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Quincy Adams' eloquent speeches on the floor of Statuary Hall over and over and over demanding an end to this abomination, that God will judge America harshly if we don't eliminate it, Lincoln said, after he became President, wasn't much happening during those 2 years he was in the House except for those "great sermons from that dear man Adams."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope that not only can we move forward with naming the hall more appropriately Emancipation Hall, I think that's wonderful, but I think that we ought to restore to the plans God, who made it all possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I just want to close by thanking Mr. Wamp, the gentleman from Tennessee, and Mr. Jackson for his help in moving this forward. This certainly is a very fitting honor. And I ask all of my colleagues for a resounding "yes" vote to this so that we might move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for her hard work in pushing this forward and getting it on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like, also, to thank Mr. Wamp and Mr. Jackson, who worked very diligently on this bill to reach this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to read from the recently released report of the Task Force on Slavery, on the use of slaves in the Capitol:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The issue of slavery, in particular, was an embarrassing subject that did not sit well with squeamish writers. Early histories of the Capitol were focused on architecture, architects and superintendents, and not on the workmen who actually implemented the plans and orders. This situation has changed dramatically in more recent accounts, which reflect a new respect for all who played a role in the Capitol's history, including lower-class laborers and slaves. This is the result of a more inclusive  view of history by modern scholars and a relatively new interest in multi-cultural subjects."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report also says, and here, again, I'm quoting: "It is not possible to examine the documents of the National Archives related to the Capitol's early construction without being impressed by the sheer number of references to `negro hire.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, according to the records, the financial records of the District of Columbia, hundreds of local residents of the District of Columbia received payments for the work of the slaves they owned here. Remember, the Capitol of the United States retained slavery until just before the end of the Civil War. But we should not forget  that, while it is well enough to acknowledge that slaves were instrumental in building this building, there is no building  from the 19th century that was constructed in this town, no public building, no building of any note, that was not built in part through the labor of slaves. This was true throughout the United States. Faneuil Hall in Boston, the so-called "Cradle of Liberty," was built by slave labor. The homes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were constructed with the help of slaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They will never be commemorated. What Emancipation Hall will do is to make Americans want to know more about how much of our country was built on the backs of slave labor that have never been recognized. And Emancipation Hall is the place to do it because the visitor center itself is going to be a giant temple for education about our country, about our Capitol, and about what has happened in this building. So when people visit the Capitol and come through Emancipation Hall, there should be a  marker indicating why the great entrance to the visitor center is named Emancipation Hall. And throughout their visit, as they travel down the history of our country, which is going to be recorded there in so many ways, they will be educated about much that has happened in our country; and for most Americans, this will be the first time they will have been educated about slaves and their contribution to the United States of America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill>, a bill to designate the great hall of the Capitol Visitor Center ("CVC") as "Emancipation Hall". I commend the work of the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson) for their work in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Capitol and its iconic dome are symbols of democracy around the world; symbols of the deliberative legislative process, a place where people debate in the realm of ideas not with arms, swords, or bombs but with minds and ideas. As America has grown and changed over its history, so has the Capitol. Beginning next year, the Capitol will have an extraordinary new addition, the Capitol Visitor Center. The CVC represents the largest addition to the U.S. Capitol in its 212-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This facility will host the more than three million people who visit the Capitol on an annual basis. The great hall will include information and ticketing desks, and provide an area where Americans from all over the country can gather to take in scenic views of the Capitol or prepare to explore the 580,000-square-foot Visitor Center. The CVC will also include an exhibition gallery, a 550-seat cafeteria, gift shops, and orientation theaters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CVC will provide an opportunity for visitors to learn about the construction of the Capitol from its very beginning. This education would not be complete without an acknowledgement of the contribution slave labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Congress directed the Architect of the Capitol to produce a report on the history of slave labor in the construction of the United States Capitol. Although the record is incomplete because of limited documentation of slave labor, the evidence available and historical context provide several indications that slaves and free African Americans played a significant role in building these historical monuments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Capitol was constructed during a time when the Potomac region's population was sparse, but the concentration of slave laborers was the highest in the nation. Slave labor was an integral component of the region's workforce. Slave labor was utilized in all aspects of construction of the Capitol and slaves often worked alongside free blacks and whites in the areas of carpentry, masonry, carting, and painting. Many of the products of slave labor are still visible in the Capitol buildings  today and they serve as a reminder of the significant and undeniable contribution that these individuals made to our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the Slave Laborers Task Force was established to study and recognize the contributions of enslaved African Americans in building the U.S. Capitol. On November 7, 2007, the Slave Laborers Task Force, chaired by Representative John Lewis, specifically recommended that the great hall of the Capitol Visitor Center be designated as "Emancipation Hall".</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill> acknowledges the historic contributions of slaves and freedman to the building of the United States Capitol. This bill is a fitting tribute to those who worked tirelessly, but especially to those who were slaves and who gave their labor in this citadel of freedom and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support recognizing emancipation and honoring the contributions of slaves in the construction of the Capitol. However, as I discussed in the subcommittee hearing and full committee markup, I have concerns about renaming the Great Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the history of the Capitol, none of the monumental spaces, such as the House and Senate chambers or the Rotunda, have been named after specific individuals or events in history. Instead, these great spaces of the Capitol have long been called by their functional names. By doing so, all people regardless of their race, ethnic heritage, contributions, or human travails are equally recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These spaces are dramatic because of their physical settings and the unique historical events that took place within their walls. Similarly, the Great Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center will become a monumental space with its own unique history; and just as those spaces have not been named, I believe the Great Hall should be reserved and left to honor all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I do not believe it is appropriate to rename the Great Hall, I do believe that it is important for Congress to acknowledge and honor the contributions slaves made to the Capitol. In the hearing held by the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management and again in the full committee markup of this legislation, I recommended that other spaces could better acknowledge emancipation and honor the slaves that helped build the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be most appropriate to name the exhibition hall that will provide an important historical context to the name Emancipation Hall. It would also provide visitors an opportunity to learn about and pay tribute to emancipation. One of the first recommendations I made as a member of the Capitol Preservation Commission was to create a first class museum space within the CVC. I proposed the highest level museum  space so America could exhibit some of the Nation's treasurers--like the Emancipation Proclamation--which are rarely viewed by the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The exhibition hall will be 16,500 square feet. Outside of the National Archives Building, this will be our Nation's finest exhibition space. This hall will not only honor those who built the Capitol, but provide information about their contributions to American history. This exhibition hall will display and prominently house the catafalque that was built to support the casket of Abraham Lincoln--the Great Emancipator. This is the original funeral bier used as the Great Emancipator lay in state  in the Capitol Rotunda. This hall will contain permanent exhibits on the Constitution and the post-Civil War amendments proposed by Congress and ratified by the States to abolish slavery, to guarantee equal protection under the law, and to ensure the right to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This beautiful hall will have strong historical and contextual links to emancipation. It will be the primary venue for acknowledging and commemorating the slaves who helped build the Capitol and the country. It will help deepen the understanding of our Nation's long struggle with slavery and its ultimate abolition for all who visit here. For all of these reasons, nothing could be more appropriate or significant than naming this area of the Capitol Visitor Center Emancipation Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another possible Emancipation naming CVC venue would be the congressional auditorium. While it does not have the strong links to emancipation as the exhibition hall, it is the most significant functional space in the facility, a place where leaders will gather to discuss important ideas of their time. The auditorium is a grand space that is being designed to serve as an alternative House Chamber. Except for the current House and Senate Chambers, no other venue in the Capitol has such an important  purpose. The name Emancipation Hall would serve as a valuable reminder of courage, leadership, and our unique commitment to advance the cause of human freedom and fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. As such, I believe it would be appropriate and fitting to name the facility Emancipation Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In sum, I believe there are more appropriate areas in the Capitol Visitor Center to name Emancipation Hall. Additionally, we have a tradition of leaving the monumental spaces of the Capitol un-named. As a monumental space in, and an introduction to, the Capitol, the Great Hall should retain its current functional name like the other great spaces within the Capitol.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill>, to provide that the great hall of the Capitol Visitor Center shall be known as Emancipation Hall, and to commend the Slave Laborers Task Force, led by Congressman John Lewis, and its important work. As the Task Force concluded, <bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill> helps to fill an important gap in the history of the Capitol. It is a fitting, albeit overdue, tribute to the slaves--gifted carpenters, skilled stone masons, woodworkers,  clay makers and other craftsmen-- who built the Capitol that the Capitol Visitor Center be renamed Emancipation Hall and celebrate the freeing of all Americans from bondage, oppression, and restraint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Capitol symbolizes our nation's core values of freedom and liberty and the basic rights of all humans. It symbolizes who we are as a nation. However, though countless visitors walk its halls each day, few know the important role slaves played in the construction of the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many slaves worked in quarries, extracting the stone used to construct this building. Others were used as carpenters. Women and children often molded clay in kilns. District of Columbia financial records show that hundreds of local residents received payment for the work of slaves, recorded in the ledger as "Negro hire." In all, hundreds of slaves helped build the Capitol from the late 1700s until the mid-1800s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, it was Philip Reid, a slave laborer who figured out how to take apart the plaster mold for the "Freedom" statue, which still crowns the dome, beneath which we toil, to allow it to be cast in bronze. What irony, what symbolism: Slaves built our monument to freedom; and the "Freedom" statue was cast in bronze by a man who was not free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we have an opportunity to celebrate freedom; to make sure that every person who visits the Capitol knows that it is for preserving and protecting freedom that we, as Members of Congress, gather in this building and work every day; and that it is for liberty, democracy and freedom--emancipation--that our nation stands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emancipation Hall is an important reminder that the floors on which we walk, the walls that surround us and, yes, the "Freedom" statue atop the Capitol dome, were constructed in significant part by men and women who knew no liberty and were not free. We should never forget that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3315">H.R. 3315</bill>--legislation which would designate the great hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center as Emancipation Hall. As Vice Chair of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I must note that similar language was added to <bill type="h" number="2771">H.R. 2771</bill>--the House-passed 2008 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this recognition is long over due. For nearly two centuries, the slaves who helped to build our Capitol have been overlooked, brushed aside, and denied their just recognition. How ironic that this great building that is viewed world-wide as a symbol of freedom, a symbol of justice, and a symbol of democracy, was constructed in part, piece by piece, by those who did not know freedom nor justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I would like to thank the Slave Laborers Task Force, chaired by Rep. John Lewis, for their diligence and commitment in ensuring that the slaves who labored to build our Nation's Capitol are both recognized and honored.</paragraph>
