  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I have mentioned before, last year Washington was rocked by the Abramoff scandal and other misdeeds. I am pleased that Congress has shown it is taking seriously its responsibility to the American people by revisiting and tightening the rules and laws that govern Members of the Senate. Many have said that <bill type="s" number="1">S.1</bill>, which overwhelmingly passed out of the Senate last week, includes the most sweeping ethics reform measures since Watergate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one point that I discussed and pushed forward during last year's debate that I believe needs to again be part of what we are doing now. Last year I offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to make many of the reforms we have considered throughout this ethics debate apply to all branches of Government. I am pleased that this sense of the Senate was accepted and is included in the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the debate last week, I filed an amendment, No. 71, which builds upon the principle behind this sense of the Senate--that the standards employed in this bill should be the minimum standards that guide the other branches of Government. I thought this was a good amendment--in fact, a necessary amendment--that ought to be accepted into this bill. Unfortunately, that did not happen. I have spoken with some of my colleagues and understand that though there is general support for the principle  that ethics standards in the executive branch should be as stringent as those made applicable by this bill, some of my colleagues believe the provisions of this amendment warrant further evaluation. Though I am disappointed this amendment will not be included on this bill, I respect and appreciate the importance and value of committee evaluation and will look forward to working on this issue as that committee process proceeds.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to thank my friend and colleague from Nebraska for bringing this amendment and important issue forward. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has jurisdiction over these issues which impact the executive branch. As chairman of that committee, I can appreciate that this amendment warrants more thorough evaluation and deliberation. Later this year, the committee will consider the reauthorization of the Office of Government Ethics--the executive  branch's ethics arm. I look forward to working with my friend from Nebraska on the issue throughout the year and as we consider this reauthorization and other matters.</paragraph>
