    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to memorialize the lives of Justin Anderson, Travis Cale, Lauren Mahon, Cassidy Pendley, William Rhea, Allison Walden, all students of the University of South Carolina which I proudly represent here in this body, and Emily Yelton, a student of Clemson University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when young men and women go off to pursue education, their families hope for them a bright future and a long life. All seven of these young men and women lost their lives in a fire this weekend, and I join with those that I represent at the University of South Carolina in offering condolences to these families. I also say to the families of Clemson University, our hearts go out to all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask that you and this body join me in a moment of silence in memory of these young people.</paragraph>
