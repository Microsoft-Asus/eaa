    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel, which is being celebrated today around the world. Since May 1948, the Jewish state has transformed itself from a fledgling band of pioneers and immigrants to a strong, robust, and democratic state. Israel has been an indispensible friend over the years and remains our greatest ally in the Middle East. One of the world's most innovative and exemplary countries, Israel has lived up to its founding  ideal of being a "light unto the nations."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beset on all sides by enemies, Israel declared its independence under cover of night on the fifth day of the Jewish month of Iyar. The new country was immediately recognized by U.S. President Harry Truman, a decision which continues to make America proud. Still, the surrounding armies immediately invaded. Challenged in a war for its survival, Israel prevailed to enjoy its independence. Israel would face existential threats from larger foes several times again, prevailing each time and steadily  growing stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet, for 60 years now, the State of Israel has done far more than just survive and persevere. Mr. President, it has thrived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Politically, Israel has built a sanctuary of democracy, the rule of law, and basic rights and freedoms. Religiously, Israel has built a tolerant society for the Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Bahai who share the Holy Land. Economically, it is a modern marvel, home of some of the most high-level technological advances in the world. In the field of agricultural production, which is so important to my home State of South Dakota, Israel has done the so-called impossible and it has made the desert  bloom. The invention of the surface drip irrigation system revolutionized farmers' ability to bring water to their crops, creating a lasting benefit for the entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to Israel on 60 years of statehood. Our friendship and alliance with Israel is an extension of our interests and our values, and I look forward to a strong U.S.-Israel relationship for generations to come.</paragraph>
