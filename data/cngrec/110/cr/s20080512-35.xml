    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the community of Woonsocket, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. Woonsocket is a rural community located in Sanborn County, which is also celebrating the 100th anniversary of its courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Woonsocket was founded in the summer of 1883 at the junction of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and Saint Paul Railroads, and it was given its name by the Superintendent of the railroad, C.H. Prior after his home town in Rhode Island. The city grew at a tremendous rate upon dedication as 50 lots were sold in the first day. The first church service in the town was held just 3 days after the sale of the first lot. The population grew rapidly and the first business that opened was a saloon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Woonsocket was named county seat of Sanborn County by the Territorial Legislature in 1884. In October 1906 the city of Woonsocket proposed a Sanborn courthouse. The proposal was accepted and a courthouse was built for $50,000. It was dedicated May 22, 1908.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Woonsocket is still a thriving community, with many restaurants, local businesses and churches all nestled around scenic Lake Prior. With excellent schools, Woonsocket school district boasts a 100-percent graduation rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Woonsocket celebrate this momentous occasion on the Fourth of July and are marking the 100-year anniversary of the courthouse on May 22. One hundred and twenty-five years after its founding Woonsocket remains a vital community and a great asset to the wonderful State of South Dakota. I am proud to honor Woonsocket and Sanborn County on these historic milestones.</paragraph>
