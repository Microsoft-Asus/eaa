    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for <bill type="h" number="954">H.R. 954</bill>, a bill to designate the post office located at 365 West 125th Street in Harlem as the Percy Sutton Post Office Building. Percy Sutton is a giant of the New York community. He is a patriot, a veteran Tuskegee Airman, and a pioneering leader in multiple fields--politician, civil rights activist, lawyer and entrepreneur. And, through a lifetime of extraordinary work in the public and  private  sectors, he has been the driving force behind the exemplary renaissance of Harlem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, Percy Sutton is a commendable American, who never stopped believing in the promise of our Nation, that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, even when legally sanctioned discrimination held him down. By dint of his talent, hard work, optimism and faith in the possibility of America, he became the perfect embodiment of the transformation of America from a separate and unequal place to a more perfect union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy is an intellectual of the first order who worked at a New York post office to put himself through law school. Therefore, naming the post office in his honor, in his beloved Harlem--a community he has done so much for--is a perfect tribute to this prominent American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The youngest of 15 children, Percy Sutton was born on November 24, 1920, in San Antonio, TX. His parents were both educators, and his father went on to become one of the first African American principals in the Nation. All of his siblings graduated from college, and his brothers include the first black elected official in San Antonio and a judge on the New York Supreme Court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Sutton attended Prairie View A&amp;M University, Tuskegee Institute, and the Hampton Institute. His public service career began when Sutton served with the now legendary Tuskegee Airmen in World War II, winning combat stars as an intelligence officer. Despite being barred from flying fighter planes for the Army Air Corps because of his race, he remained committed to serving his country. After an honorable discharge from the Army, he enrolled in Brooklyn Law School. During this time, he worked  for the U.S. Post Office in New York as a clerk during the evening shift and later as a conductor in the New York City subway system to put himself through school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Motivated to fight racial discrimination, upon finishing law school Sutton become an important civil rights advocate. His commitment to fight for justice and equality lead him to become a well-known attorney, representing Malcolm X and other activists during the civil rights era. Sutton also served as president of the New York chapter of the NAACP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy has also been a pillar in Harlem and New York politics. A leader of the Harlem political scene, he worked with Mayor David Dinkins, Congressman CHARLES RANGEL, and former New York Secretary of State Basil Paterson to create a lasting force for effective community representation at the local, State and national levels. In 1964, Sutton was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he served for 2 years before becoming the president for the Borough of Manhattan for 10 years, when  that office was at the center of gravity of New York City's policymaking apparatus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His strong ties to Harlem can be further seen in the historic Apollo Theatre, which he purchased and completely revitalized in 1980. Sutton also produced "It's Showtime at the Apollo." Today, as Harlem thrives, the Apollo Theatre remains a cornerstone of the community. Sutton also started the Inner City Broadcasting Company, home of the first African American owned radio station in New York. Through it all, Percy was a trail blazer in the extraordinary transformation of Harlem. While victory  has many fathers and mothers, no one person has done more, for more time, or more effectively to realize this vision, than Percy Sutton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Percy Sutton's impact on his community and his country is immeasurable. Renaming the post office building in Harlem, the neighborhood for which he has done so much, the Percy Sutton Post Office is a perfect tribute to this special man.</paragraph>
