  <narrative>U.S. WITHDRAWAL OF LETTERS TO CUBA -- (Senate - January 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="278">S278</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, with Florida's marine environment and tourism economy threatened by potential drilling a mere 45 miles off its coast, and a communist regime ruling Cuba, we find ourselves in a difficult situation. We must do all that we can to protect our Nation's natural treasures while at the same time emphasizing that the undemocratic Castro government has no right to speak for the people of Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have asked President Bush to withdraw the letters that the United States exchanges with Cuba every 2 years. This exchange of letters is the only thing enforcing the 1977 Maritime Boundary Agreement between the United States and Cuba, and incidentally, one of the only rationales the Castro government has for drilling just 45 miles off of our pristine coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen what oil spills have done in other parts of the country and around the world. I am not prepared to take chances with Florida's coral reefs and other marine life, nor with the livelihoods of millions of Floridians who depend on tourism for their economic well-being. The continued exchange of these letters leaves the door open to economic and environmental disaster and the enrichment of the Castro regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, I urge the administration to join me in closing this door on disaster and to protect Florida by withdrawing these letters now. Should Cuba gain a democratically elected government as envisioned by the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity--or LIBERTAD--Act of 1996, we could consider renegotiating our boundary agreement so that it clearly protects the environment. Until that time, however, withdrawing these letters is the best and first step towards protecting the people and environment  of Florida.</paragraph>
