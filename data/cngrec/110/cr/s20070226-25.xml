    <paragraph>Madam President, we had a vote scheduled for 9:30 on cloture of the Commerce aspect of the homeland security work we are going to be doing in the next couple weeks. Because of various clerical problems and just the way the Senate works, the bulk of the homeland security work we are going to be doing--probably 65 percent of it--deals with the Homeland Security Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Lieberman. The ranking member is Senator Collins. About 15 percent of what we are going  to be doing deals with Banking and about 20 percent or thereabouts--these are all rough estimates--deals with the Commerce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to invoke cloture on the Commerce aspect--an effort to move it forward by 1 day--because with the first amendment, after we got on this legislation, we would move to put the homeland security legislation in, which basically has it all in it anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken at some length with the distinguished Republican leader, and it was felt by both of us it would be better if we could speak to our two caucuses tomorrow during the lunch hour to see how we should proceed tomorrow afternoon. That is why we changed the time for voting from in the morning until 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote occur tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Tomorrow, the Senate will conduct a period of morning business until the time when the Senate recesses for the conference work periods. I will continue to discuss the schedule with the Republican leader with respect to the 9/11 Commission legislation, as I indicated. So for scheduling purposes, Members should be here at 2:30 for the cloture vote. If we are able to vitiate that vote, Members will be notified in a timely fashion.</paragraph>
