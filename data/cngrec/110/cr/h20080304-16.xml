    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend our distinguished colleague from the Virgin Islands, a valuable member of our Committee on Natural Resources and the chairwoman of our Insular Affairs Subcommittee, DONNA CHRISTENSEN, for sponsoring the pending legislation, <bill type="h" number="1143">H.R. 1143</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would authorize the National Park Service to continue its successful relationship with Caneel Bay Resort, ensure that park resources are protected, and allow the resort to undertake needed maintenance and improvement programs that will benefit visitors to Virgin Islands National Park and the Caneel Bay Resort well into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Christensen deserves our thanks for her work in ensuring that visitor services at Virgin Islands National Park are available and that resources are protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully support passage of the pending bill and urge its adoption by the House today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on <bill type="h" number="1143">H.R. 1143</bill> and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been adequately explained by Chairman Rahall. We support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands, Dr. Christensen.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in, of course, strong support of <bill type="h" number="1143">H.R. 1143</bill>, legislation I introduced to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a new arrangement, a lease with the owners of Caneel Bay Resort in my congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to also thank Chairman Rahall as well as Chairman Grijalva for not only supporting the passage of this bill, but for traveling to my district to see for themselves the importance of Caneel Bay to the island and to the people of St. John.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Caneel Bay traces its roots to Laurence Rockefeller's coming to the island of St. John in 1952. He purchased the then-existing resort facilities and also acquired more than 5,000 surrounding acres to protect the area. In 1956, he donated the additional land to create the Virgin Islands National Park. At the same time, he created Caneel Bay Resort, comprising 170 acres, which continues to complement and to be environmentally consistent with the natural beauty of the park's setting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rockefeller subsequently decided to transfer the land underlying Caneel Bay to the National Park Service, while retaining the improvements and continuing the Caneel Bay operations. He accomplished this through the execution of a series of unique agreements generally known as a retained use estate, or RUE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1143">H.R. 1143</bill> became necessary because the RUE is slated to expire in 2023, and its current owners require more than the remaining 15 years to provide the capital and long-term financing necessary to reverse the decline of the facilities over the years and to return it to the grandeur and stature that it deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, other than the Virgin Islands National Park, Caneel Bay Resort is perhaps the single most important entity to the tourism-based economy of St. John, and it's also important to the economy of the Virgin Islands in general. It is not an exaggeration to say that Caneel Bay helped to establish the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Island of St. John in particular, as a major tourist destination point, playing a prominent role in the island's economic renaissance of the mid-1900s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Since its founding in October of 1956, it has been and remains a paradise of choice for generations of families, many of whom return every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's also the largest employer on St. John, employing approximately 475 workers, many of whom spend their entire career spanning two or three decades, and some even more than that as employees of Caneel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Natural Resources staff director, Jim Zoia, and the staff of the National Parks, Forest and Public Lands Subcommittee, in particular former staff director Rick Healy and current staff director Dave Watkins, for their hard work in making it possible for <bill type="h" number="1143">H.R. 1143</bill> to be on the floor today. I also want to thank the full committee ranking member, Don Young, and subcommittee ranking member, Rob Bishop, and their staffs for their support  as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill, which is very important to the economy of the Virgin Islands.</paragraph>
