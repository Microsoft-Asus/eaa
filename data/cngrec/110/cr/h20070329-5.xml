    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the House will pass a budget which will fund the war in Iraq far into 2009. The budget includes an extra $195 billion mostly for military operations in Iraq. Anyone who thinks this Congress is trying to end the war had better think again, because this budget signals we will be in Iraq for another 2 years or more, even though Congress has led the American people and the media to believe otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress recently engaged in a dubious debate about a nonbinding surge resolution. Even though Congress had and still has the authority to end the war now, we instead give it new life with last week's vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, $195 billion on top of last week's supplemental means close to $300 billion in a week approved to continue the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This war has sacrificed the lives of our troops and innocent civilians. It has advanced the interests of oil companies and contractors in the manner of a criminal enterprise. It has besmirched our national honor and alienated America from friends around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When will Congress stand for truth and for peace and stop funding this war?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
