  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to honor and recognize over 25 years of service by Stanley E. Reed to our great State of Arkansas. A third-generation cotton farmer from Marianna, AR, Stanley has served the Arkansas agriculture community with steady leadership for over 20 years as a member of the Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation board, including the last five as president. At the upcoming Farm Bureau State Convention on December 4, Stanley will hand over  the gavel as president, and I wanted to take this opportunity to recognize his many contributions to our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Marianna in 1951, Stanley attended the University of Arkansas where he graduated in 1973 with a degree in Agricultural Engineering and was awarded Highest Honors. Although Stanley was a tremendous student, he also displayed his leadership skills  early on, serving as President of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity, President of the Inter Fraternity Council, and President of the Cardinal XX Honorary Society. Upon graduation, Stanley attended the University  of Arkansas School of Law were he received his Juris Doctorate in 1976 and was also awarded Highest Honors. Upon taking the Arkansas Bar Exam that year, Stanley scored the highest grade in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although licensed as an attorney, Stanley returned to the family farm, producing cotton in Lee and St. Francis Counties. He soon became active within the agricultural community and served as president of the Lee County Farm Bureau from 1982-1984. Soon after, he joined the board of directors of the Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation in 1988, later serving as secretary-treasurer for 6 years, vice president for 4 years, and, as I mentioned before, president for the past 6 years. He has also served  on the American Farm Bureau Board of Directors since 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His involvement in the Arkansas agriculture community has led him on trade missions to Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, South Korea, and Peru. In addition, I had the good fortune to be joined by Stanley and other Arkansas farmers on a trade mission to Cuba in 2000 to discuss the opening of the Cuban market to Arkansas goods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What makes Stanley so unique, though, is that his service to Arkansas extends beyond the agriculture world. Education has always been a priority for him. He served for 4 years on the Lee Academy School Board, where his children attended, and he just recently completed a 10-year term on the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees, where he served as chairman for 2 years. He is a member of the Arkansas Academy for Agriculture Engineers and has been honored as Distinguished Alumni of the College  of Engineering. Additionally, he has served on the board of directors for Baptist Health and as a board member of Simmons First National Bank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Faith is an important part of Stanley's life. A member of the First Baptist Church in Marianna, Stanley has served as a Deacon in the church and taught youth and adult Sunday School classes for over 20 years. More importantly, he has been involved in prison ministries locally and oversaw the fundraising and construction of the prison chapel at an Arkansas Department of Corrections facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last but certainly not least, Stanley's family--his wife Charlene and three children, Haley Davis, Nathan, and Anna--has been a tremendous source of pride and inspiration for him. In fact, Nathan is carrying on the family farming tradition and works with Stanley on the farm. Stanley is also the proud grandfather to Anna Kate, Jack, and Haven Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see, Stanley Reed is Arkansas through and through. So as he steps down as president of the Arkansas Farm Bureau, I want to thank him for all that he has done for Arkansas and in particularly, the Arkansas agriculture community. Stanley, although you are ending your tenure, I know you will not be far away. I look forward to working with you and know you will continue to make your impact felt in your community and in the State you love so much.</paragraph>
