  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO ILYSE SCHUMAN -- (Senate - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10876">S10876</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is one of the great traditions of the Senate, when we pass legislation that will change the direction of the Nation and our economy, that we pause for a moment after final passage to acknowledge the efforts of those members of our staffs who worked so hard behind the scenes to help us bring the matter to the floor for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all have great staffs, people who are committed to the future of our country and to making a difference that will last for generations to come. Although that is true, I have always said that my team ranks with the best. In fact, if there were an Olympic event for staffs, I have no doubt my team would win the gold medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the role they play in our work, they have a tendency to get noticed by the groups and organizations that are involved in the issues that come before the House and the Senate. The working relationship they develop with our staffs often leads to increased opportunities and sends some of our best workers off the Hill and into the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When that happens, I like to believe we are not losing a staffer; we are just expanding our field of influence. Still, when you lose someone who has played such a key role in the day to day work of our offices and the Senate, it is a great loss to the team as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought about that when I learned of Ilyse Schuman's plans to leave the committee and take a leadership position with the Medical Imaging and Technology Alliance. Although I was sorry to hear the news, I was pleased to know that she would be working for such a well respected and effective organization. It will be another great opportunity for her and I know she will make the most of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can say that with certainty because that is the kind of person Ilyse Schuman is--thoughtful, reflective and committed to the future of our country and our health care system. Her interest in the problems we face as a nation and her ability to work with staffs on both sides of the aisle to find solutions that work and make sense was one of the principal reasons why we hired her several years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember standing on the Senate floor earlier this year, when we passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. This groundbreaking legislation will unlock a door that will allow people to get the kind of genetic testing they need to give them an advance warning about something that might happen to their health down the road if they don't take the steps today to prevent or at least weaken its effects. The legislation we passed that day will ensure the results of our tests will be used  for our benefit, and will not be allowed to be used against us in our employment or our insurance coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That bill had been a key part of the committee's legislative agenda for 6 years. That was just about the time when we hired Ilyse Schuman. In my remarks on the bill's final passage, I said that I had often heard it said that it usually takes 6 years to get an important idea through the Senate. I said I wasn't sure I believed it, until I realized that she had been working on the bill for 6 years and that fact seemed to prove the idea has some merit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should have known that if it were possible to get the job done, Ilyse would have been a part of it because she has a history of excellence and making the impossible possible. She graduated cum laude from Tufts University and then earned her J.D. from the Georgetown University Law Center--with honors. More recently, she was named a John Stennis Congressional Staff Fellow for the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had been working as the senior counsel at a firm in Chicago when someone we interviewed suggested we talk to her about a position on the committee. She hadn't given much thought to government service, but the time must have been right because we were very pleased when she decided to pack her bags and come to Washington to begin this chapter in her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as it comes to a close, Ilyse has a lot to look back on with a great deal of pride and personal satisfaction. Among the legislation she helped to shepherd through the legislative process, in addition to the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, was the Food and Drug Amendments Act, Health Information Technology legislation, FDA Drug Safety Reform, the Pension Protection Act, Head Start, Patient Safety, the Workforce Investment Act, and many more. In addition, she has played a vital  leadership role on the Committee and served as more than its staff director, she has been more of a coach who helped the whole team to work together and function as a more efficient unit. She is going to be very difficult to replace. In fact, she is one of those people</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ilyse was once asked about her position on the committee and how much it meant to her to have a chance to do something that would last, something that would make life better for us all. She said it meant a lot to her to be a part of the work on "the issues that are most personal to everyone's lives." She saw it as "an opportunity to have a huge impact on the quality of life across the country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ilyse knew that to have the impact she hoped to achieve, she would need to forge good working relationships with staffs on both sides of the aisle. Fortunately, it was one of her strong suits. Ilyse knows how to disagree without being disagreeable. That was important because, at the end of the day, when she went home after a long day's work, she left with the respect of her colleagues in every office she worked with, a respect that was mutual and will prove to be lasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now Ilyse is leaving to take on another exciting adventure in her life. Diana and I will miss seeing her every day because she has become part of our extended family. We wish her the best of luck in this and in all of her future endeavors. In the months to come, I know we can continue to look to her for her leadership, direction and guidance on our efforts to make our Nation's health care system better, more effective, more efficient and more responsive for all Americans. It is a heartfelt goal  Ilyse is determined to achieve and I know she will continue to be a part of that effort in the years to come. Knowing Ilyse and the operation of the Senate, I would say that we will be seeing the results of her efforts in just about 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I won't say goodbye, Ilyse. I know I will be hearing more from you and about you in the months and years to come. So I will just say keep in touch and we'll all look forward to seeing you around this special campus on the Hill, I hope, for a long, long time.</paragraph>
