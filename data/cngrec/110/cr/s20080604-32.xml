    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the community of Roscoe, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. Located in Edmunds County, Roscoe is a rural community infused with hospitality, beauty, and an exceptional quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having come far since Sam Basford and Charles Purchase Morgan used a tent as a hotel in April 1883, Roscoe was named after Charles Morgan's good friend Roscoe Conkling. The combination of Basford, Morgan, Engle, and Elliot's land toward the creation of Roscoe led to its importance as a transportation center in 1886 for the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad. From the boom of migration westward, Roscoe persevered and prospered through life's trials in the great frontier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Roscoe is still a thriving community. There are upwards of 30 active businesses operating in Roscoe, including one of the largest honeybee farms in the Nation, two farm equipment dealerships, seed dealerships, and a post. Roscoe's school is still running, and the town boasts several churches and a public library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Roscoe celebrated this momentous occasion on the weekend of July 4-6. A parade, car show, and local entertainment kick off the celebration, with picnics, art, and games in the beautiful city park. One hundred and twenty five years after its founding, Roscoe remains a vital community and a great asset to the wonderful State of South Dakota. I am proud to honor Roscoe on this historic milestone.</paragraph>
