  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is becoming clear day by day that the President's troop escalation plan is not in the best interest of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the President's troop escalation plan would take substantially more troops and more money than the President has suggested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President says 21,500 troops are needed; the CBO says 48,000 troops are necessary to conduct the mission. The President says it will cost about $5.6 billion, but CBO says that the number could be four times higher than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the administration's intelligence agencies concluded last week that violence would continue in Iraq for at least another 18 months, but the President says his plan will calm the violence in 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, third, Pentagon officials admitted last week that they do not have enough armored vehicles, armored kits and other equipment needed to protect these additional troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after hearing these three different facts, how can anyone believe the President's troop escalation plan is in the best interests of this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that note, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
