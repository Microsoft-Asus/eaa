    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, President Bush proposed that our Nation spend another $196 billion in Iraq next year. Today we will spend $330 million fighting the war in Iraq. Imagine that. Every day, $330 million in taxpayer dollars is going to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just imagine for one moment what we could do here in the United States with that money instead. We could hire an additional 1,700 Border Patrol agents to work our borders for an entire year. We could provide health care to 50,000 more veterans so they receive the essential health care treatment that they need. We could enroll 46,000 more children in Head Start for 1 year, so they can receive early childhood education. If we took 1 day of funding from the Iraq war, we could help nearly 800,000  families keep their heat on this winter through the LIHEAP program. We could provide 270,000 more children health care coverage through the CHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while President Bush has no problem sending billions of dollars to Iraq, he is neglecting essential needs here in America. The Democratic majority in this Congress refuses to follow that lead.</paragraph>
