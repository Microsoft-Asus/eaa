  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="Introducing S. 2595. A bill to create a national licensing system for residential mortgage loan originators, to develop minimum standards of conduct to be enforced by State regulators, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2595">S. 2595</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator MARTINEZ to introduce legislation that takes a major step forward in curbing the abusive lending practices which contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis. With foreclosures at record levels, the housing market in steady decline, a global credit crunch, and the economy nearing recession, it is imperative that we act quickly to restore confidence in the American dream of home ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation will eliminate bad actors from the mortgage business, and require that brokers and lenders meet minimum national standards which ensure they are professional, competent, and trustworthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it would create a comprehensive database of all residential mortgage loan originators. This includes mortgage brokers and lenders, as well as loan officers of national banks and their subsidiaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it would establish national licensing standards to ensure that mortgage brokers and lenders are trained in legal aspects of lending, ethics, and consumer protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill is similar to <bill type="h" number="3012">H.R. 3012</bill>, introduced in the House by Representative SPENCER BACHUS, the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Financial Services. The national licensing concept for loan originators has enjoyed bipartisan support and was included in the comprehensive mortgage reform bill, <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, which recently passed the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A combination of low interest rates and sophisticated mortgage products, among other factors, helped increase home ownership to record levels just 3 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subprime and exotic mortgages allowed millions of Americans--many with little or no down payment and questionable credit--to purchase homes by using adjustable-rate products with low initial monthly payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was explosive growth in the use of these sub-prime loans: in just 2 years, from 2004 to 2006, the number of subprime mortgages in California increased 110 percent, from 273,000 to 573,000--29.4 percent of total mortgages in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the majority of lenders and brokers offered these mortgages in a responsible fashion, many others relied upon predatory lending tactics to place unsuspecting borrowers in mortgages they could not afford. Competitive pressures and lax oversight resulted in loans of increasingly poor quality being written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make matters worse, consumers were not adequately protected from bad actors in the mortgage industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FBI recently reported that complaints of mortgage fraud have skyrocketed over the last few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the number of suspicious activity reports reviewed by the FBI economic crimes unit numbered 3,000. The number of mortgage fraud complaints increased to 48,000 last year, representing a jump of 1500 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most mortgage brokers and non-bank lenders are only lightly regulated by State agencies. Standards of accountability have not kept pace with the increasing sophistication of the mortgage industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As adjustable-rate mortgages reset to higher rates, many American families find themselves in homes they can no longer afford. The percentage of homeowners currently behind on their mortgage payments is at its highest level in 21 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, 2.2 million homeowners filed for foreclosure last year and many lenders have gone out of business or sought bankruptcy protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is projected that as many as 2 million Americans will be forced to file for foreclosure before this crisis abates, representing $160 billion in lost equity. The Center for Responsible Lending has projected that one out of every five subprime loans issued between 2005 and 2006 will fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>California has been especially hard hit. Mr. President, 5 of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rate in the Nation are in California. The foreclosure rate in California is roughly twice the national average, with 1 foreclosure filing for every 258 households in the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lenders repossessed 84,375 California homes last year, a sixfold increase from 12,672 in 2006. Default notices--the initial step in the foreclosure process--increased 143 percent between 2006 and 2007, rising from 104,977 in 2006 to 254,824 in 2007. In San Diego County alone, foreclosures were up 353 percent in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the FBI economic crimes unit, California has been identified as one of the top 10 "mortgage fraud hot spots" in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American families are hurting, and Californians are at the center of the storm. With close to 500,000 adjustable-rate mortgages scheduled to reset in California over the next 2 years, the situation is likely to worsen in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subprime mortgage crisis has threatened both the global economy and the American dream of home ownership. Accountability, professional standards, and oversight must be enhanced for everyone in the mortgage industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will make it so, and will help to ensure such a crisis never happens again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act would require that all residential mortgage loan originators are licensed, providing fingerprints, a summary of work experience, and consent for a background check to authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, minimum criteria are established that individuals must meet to obtain a license, including: no felony  convictions; no similar license revoked; a demonstrated record of financial responsibility; successful completion of education requirements, 20 hours of approved courses, to include at least 3 hours related to Federal laws, 4 hours on ethics and consumer protection in mortgage lending, and 2 hours on the subprime mortgage marketplace; and,  passage of a written exam, the exam must be at least 100 questions and a minimum score of 75 percent is required to pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must also register all residential mortgage loan originators employed by national banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, State regulators must develop a satisfactory licensing system within 1 year following enactment of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this does not occur, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary is empowered to develop the national registry and license, generating revenue for its implementation through fees to license applicants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subprime mortgage crisis is wreaking havoc on American homeowners and the national economy. The damage is truly staggering--more than 2 million foreclosure filings last year and another 2 million expected before this year is over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans simply cannot keep pace with adjustable-rate mortgages that are resetting, and some were steered into these obligations by unscrupulous actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is essential that this body take action to address some of the factors that got us here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation does not assign blame, but rather provides a workable solution to protect homebuyers and begin to restore confidence in the American dream of homeownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that my colleagues will join us in moving this important bill through the Senate quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="Introducing S. 2597. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of Moldova; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2597">S. 2597</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation designed to extend permanent normal trade relations to Moldova. Moldova is still subject to the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions nations for failure to comply with freedom of emigration requirements. This bill would repeal permanently the application of Jackson-Vanik to Moldova.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moldova is a small country located between Ukraine and Romania. Throughout the Cold War it was a part of the Soviet Union. It gained its independence from the Soviet Union on August 27, 1991. The U.S. has supported Moldova in its journey toward democracy and sovereignty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. enjoys good relations with Moldova and has encouraged Moldovan efforts to integrate with Euro-Atlantic institutions. Moldova is an active participant in Guam, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova, a group of countries that has recently concluded a new trade agreement with the EU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, Moldova has enacted a series of democratic and free market reforms. In 2001, Moldova became a member of the World Trade Organization. Until the U.S. terminates application of Jackson-Vanik on Moldova, the U.S. will not benefit from Moldova's market access commitments nor can it resort to WTO dispute resolution mechanisms. While all other WTO members currently enjoy these benefits, the U.S. does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republic of Moldova has been evaluated every year and granted normal trade relations with the U.S. through annual presidential waivers from the effects of Jackson-Vanik. The Moldovan constitution guarantees its citizens the right to emigrate and this right is respected in practice. Most emigration restrictions were eliminated in 1991 and virtually no problems with emigration have been reported in the 16 years since independence. More specifically, Moldova does not impose emigration restrictions  on members of the Jewish community. Synagogues function openly and without harassment. As a result, the Administration finds that Moldova is in full compliance with Jackson-Vanik's provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, Moldova has enacted a series of democratic and free market reforms. Parliamentary elections in 2005 and local elections in 2007 generally complied with international standards for democratic elections. Moldova has also contributed constructively towards a resolution of the long-standing separatist conflict in the country's Transniestria region, most recently by proposing a series of confidence-building measures and working groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. and Moldova have established a strong record of achievement in security cooperation. In 1997 the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program responded to a Moldovan request for assistance. The U.S. purchased and secured 14 nuclear-capable MiG-29Cs from Moldova. These fighter aircraft were built by the former Soviet Union to launch nuclear weapons. Moldova expressed concern that these aircraft were unsecure due to the lack of funds and equipment necessary to ensure they were not stolen  or smuggled out of the country. Specifically, emissaries from Iran had shown great interest and had attempted to acquire the aircraft. These planes were not destroyed. They were disassembled and shipped to Wright Patterson Air Force Base because they can be used by American experts for research purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moldova has made small, but important, troop contributions in Iraq. These contributions include significant demining capabilities and contingents of combat troops. I am pleased that the U.S. remains prepared to assist in weapons and ammunition disposal and force relocation assistance to help deal with the costs of military realignments in Moldova and to assist with military downsizing and reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the areas where we can deepen U.S.-Moldovan relations is bilateral trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration requirements, compliance with threat reduction and cooperation in the global war on terrorism, the products of Moldova should not be subject to the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik. The U.S. must remain committed and engaged in assisting Moldova in pursuing economic and development reforms. The government in Chisinau still has important work to do in these critical areas.  The support and encouragement of the U.S. and the international community will be key to encouraging the Government of Moldova to take the necessary steps to initiate reform. The permanent waiver of Jackson-Vanik and establishment of permanent normal trade relations will be the foundation on which further progress in a burgeoning economic and energy partnership can be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation. It is essential that we act promptly to bolster this important relationship and promote stability in this region.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="Introducing S. 2598. A bill to increase the supply and lower the cost of petroleum by temporarily suspending the acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2598">S. 2598</bill>] Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2007. This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to suspend filling of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, for 1 year. I appreciate that Senators Bingaman, Levin, Kerry, Collins, Lieberman, and Wyden have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation. This bill directs the Secretary to stop filling the reserve through direct purchase,  royalty-in-kind or any other measures. The secretary may only resume filling if the price of a barrel of crude oil drops below $50 per barrel during the remainder of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The price of a barrel of oil is reaching record highs and global supplies of oil continue to shrink. During this period of volatile markets and short supply, it makes no sense to me for the U.S. Government to continue to take highly valuable crude oil, especially light sweet crude, off the market to store underground in a reserve that is at least 96 percent full. Continuing to  "top off" the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with highly valuable crude oil  is putting upward pressure on oil prices and raising energy prices for consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we must take a "time out" from filling the reserve in order to send a signal to the market to reduce rising energy prices that are hitting American consumers' pocketbooks. Lowering energy costs will put additional money back into consumers' hands and will help provide a real stimulus to our economy in my judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically, the average price of oil used to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been about $27 per barrel. The Administration is now filling the Reserve with oil that averages over $90 per barrel, including highly sought after light sweet crude. This is a bad deal for American taxpayers and consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 8, 2008, the Secretary of Energy sent me a letter stating that our Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains only 57 days of import protection and that the 50,000 barrels per day they are filling with is a small amount of the oil used on the global market daily. This is only part of the story. The fact is that the SPR, combined with our private oil stocks and refining inventories, total more than 118 days of import protection. The current levels in our strategic petroleum stocks are more  than adequate to meet our international treaty obligations requiring 90 days of import protection for all OECD countries. I also disagree that taking 50,000 barrels per day off the market, especially light sweet crude, has no impact on energy prices. During the Clinton administration, Congress</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides directional guidance to expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The provision in law clearly states that filling the reserve must be achieved "without incurring excessive cost or appreciably affecting the price of petroleum products to consumers." I think filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in today's environment is indeed impacting the price of petroleum so that we must defer filling for now to ease pressure on the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Congress enacted and the President signed historic legislation in December 2008--the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. That legislation established a strong foundation to put our Nation on an alternative energy security pathway. This includes strong fuel economy standards and an expanded renewable fuels standard. Conservative estimates provided by the Securing America's Future Energy Coalition show that the new legislation would reduce net oil imports by 1.75 million  barrels per day by 2020, increasing to 2.26 million barrels per day in 2022 and rising thereafter. These estimates represent roughly half of the theoretical SPR drawdown capacity of 4.4 million barrels per day. They also increase the number of days of protection afforded by a given quantity of oil in the SPR. Thus, our enactment of historic Energy legislation will, over time, increase the insurance value of the SPR, even if the actual inventory level is frozen or slightly decreased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. I believe maintaining a Strategic Petroleum Reserve is in the economic and national security interests of this country. However, during this time of record oil prices, rising energy costs for consumers, economic downturn and tight global oil supplies, the U.S. Government should suspend taking highly valuable oil off the market to store underground in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

During the recent Iowa Caucuses, residents living in Windsor Heights Precinct 2 were directed to the wrong address when looking for their caucus location. Windsor Heights residents who use the 50322 ZIP code--one which is shared with neighboring Urbandale--were incorrectly advised that the caucus location was in Urbandale, rather than Windsor Heights. Furthermore, because insurance rates are based on ZIP codes, residents pay premiums  based on neighboring Des Moines and Urbandale, rather than Windsor Heights, making it more difficult for providers to sell car insurance to residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>City officials have tried in vain for almost 5 years to acquire a ZIP code for Windsor Heights. It is my hope that the Senate will quickly act upon this legislation to enable them to do so.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="Introducing S. 2601. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to convey to King and Kittitas Counties Fire District No. 51 a certain parcel of real property for use as a site for a new Snoqualmie Pass fire and rescue station; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2601">S. 2601</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the Snoqualmie Pass Land Conveyance Act, together with Senator Murray. This bill would transfer an acre and a half of Forest Service land to the King and Kittitas Counties Fire District No. 51, also known as Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue. This land would be conveyed at no cost, but would have to be used by the Fire District specifically for the construction of a new fire station or it would revert back to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Snoqualmie Pass Fire and Rescue serves a portion of two counties on both sides of the Cascade Mountains along Interstate 90, a community of 350 full-time residents that peaks to 1,500 during the ski season. Additionally, the ski area estimates 20,000 patrons on a busy weekend, and the Department of Transportation estimates that up to 60,000 vehicles travel through the fire district on a busy day making it the busiest mountain highway in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This area is also the major transportation corridor for goods and services between eastern and western Washington. The all-volunteer Fire Department averages over 300 calls a year with about a 10 percent annual increase in call volumes, which is more than triple the amount of calls a typical all-volunteer fire department would respond to in a year. Mr. Presdient, 84  percent of those incidents are for non-tax paying residents. Consequently, the Fire Department  has the characteristics of a large city with the limited resources of a small community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, this area has been the scene of major winter snowstorms, multi-vehicle accidents, and even avalanches. The Fire District is often the first responder to incidents in the area, which is prone to rock slides and avalanches and it is not uncommon for this community to be isolated for hours or even days at a time. Several thousand people can be stranded at the Pass during those periods when the Pass is closed and while the Department of Transportation works quickly to get the roads  back open, it can be very taxing on local resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, the Fire District has been leasing its current site from the Forest Service. They operate out of an aging building that was not designed to be a fire station. Through their hard work and dedication, they have served their community ably despite this building's many shortcomings. However, with traffic on the rise and the need for emergency services in the area growing, the Fire District needs to move to a true fire station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fire District has identified a nearby site that would better serve the public safety needs at the Pass. This location would provide easy access to the interstate in either direction, reducing emergency response times. The parcel is on Forest Service property, immediately adjacent to a freeway interchange, between a frontage road and the interstate itself. The parcel was formerly a disposal site during construction of the freeway and is now a gravel lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize that the Forest Service does not normally support conveyances of land free of charge. However, I believe an exception should be made in this particular circumstance because of the important public service provided by the Fire District, the heavy traffic and emergency calls created by nonresidents in the area, the distance of Snoqualmie Pass from other communities with emergency services, and because of the high amount of federal land ownership in the area, which severely limits the  local tax base. In fact, the Forest Service has acquired 20,000 acres in King and Kittitas counties at a cost of more than $52 million over just the last 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this legislation would not guarantee that a new station would be built. The Fire District would have to work hard to gather the financing that would be required from State and local sources, as well as any applicable Federal grants or loans. However, the conveyance of this site at no cost would help this Fire District hold down the overall cost of this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident this can be done with little or no impact to the environment. Over the last year, following the introduction of this legislation in the House of Representatives, <bill type="h" number="1285">H.R. 1285</bill>, there were ongoing discussions in Washington State to address some lingering issues related to this conveyance. I am pleased those discussions reached resolution. I am also pleased that discussions with my staff, Senator Murray's staff, and staff of Energy and Natural Resources Committee led to an amendment  to <bill type="h" number="1285">H.R. 1285</bill> before it passed the House of Representatives that would better tailor the conveyance to both the environmental and the emergency response needs at the Pass by reducing the amount of land to be conveyed from 3 acres to 1.5 acres.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that there are offers of support to construct a new fire station from state and local officials, and to mitigate any effects of construction, and I support those efforts. To offset any potential impacts from construction of a new fire station and to improve wildlife connectivity at the pass, I encourage the Forest Service to work in collaboration with state and local officials, the Cascade Land Conservancy, Snoqualmie Fire District, Sierra Club, and Conservation Northwest  to identify opportunities for off-site habitat acquisition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the efforts of Senator Murray and my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to review this issue and bring this bill forward. I look forward to continuing to work with the community at the Pass and my colleagues to improve public safety in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative> (a) Conveyance Required.--The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this section as the "Secretary") shall convey, without consideration, to King and Kittitas Counties Fire District No. 51 of King and Kittitas Counties, Washington (referred to in this section as the "District"), all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a parcel of National Forest System land in Kittitas County, Washington, consisting of approximately 1.5 acres within the SW  1/4  of the SE</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="Introducing S. 2602. A bill to amend the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations Act, 2008, to terminate the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to deduct amounts from certain States; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2602">S. 2602</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--a companion bill will be introduced in the House by my colleagues Representatives Salazar and Udall--to restore Colorado's share of oil and gas leasing revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill includes a provision, requested by the Bush Administration, to reduce the share of mineral royalties paid to Colorado and other western states. Specifically, the administration's proposal to reduce the State's share of mineral revenues from 50 percent to 48 percent does not serve the taxpayers who fund the government nor does it serve the states that allow energy production to happen within their borders. Colorado is blessed with an abundance of natural resources,  including its deposits of oil and natural gas. Our State's economy benefits from the production of these resources, and we deserve to continue receiving our fair share of the revenues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration attempts to justify this reduction as necessary to defray the administrative costs related to the management of onshore leasing activity. We believe this assertion is unfounded and oppose any attempt to take money that is rightfully owed to our State in order to pay for more Federal bureaucracy. This is money that our state could use to help mitigate the effects of increased oil and gas drilling activity and for other important state priorities, such as education and health  care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation repeals the administration's money grab and restores each State's share to its full, coequal 50 percent of mineral leasing revenues. We cannot allow the Federal government to take oil and gas leasing revenues intended to help the communities of Colorado. This language was inserted late into last year's omnibus spending bill and must be corrected. Our legislation does just that.</paragraph>
