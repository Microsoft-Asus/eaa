    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come today to discuss the situation in Colorado and surrounding States that has captured national attention. Over the last few weeks Colorado and its neighbors have experienced two record-setting blizzards. In some parts of Colorado these storms dropped almost 5 feet of snow and have created a nightmare situation for many in rural America. Thousands of head of cattle and other livestock are currently stranded without food or water. Only recently have some of these  animals begun to see relief with supply drops via helicopter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The aftermath of these devastating blizzards continues to paralyze many  counties in Colorado and the West. Thousands of local men and women have banded together and are working to provide relief to their neighbors and to the tens of thousands of livestock facing starvation. Dozens of communities have experienced severe economic damage and loss as a result of these blizzards. These storms have created a dire situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the tradition of the West local individuals have pulled together and have spent much of their holiday season trying to dig each other out and reach stranded livestock. Locals are doing all that they can, and I am grateful for the assistance that the National Guard has provided. Unfortunately more needs to be done. I am introducing legislation today that will help provide Federal resources to the backbone of America; our producers. The legislation that I introduce today will reauthorize the  Livestock Compensation Program and direct the Secretary of Agriculture to allocate funds to it from the Commodity Credit Corporation to help eligible producers that have suffered a loss from these blizzards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that the Senate will act swiftly on this important legislation that will get vital help to America's farmers and ranchers.</paragraph>
