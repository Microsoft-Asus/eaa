  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="Introducing S. 2838. A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9 of United States Code with respect to arbitration; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2838">S. 2838</bill>] Mr. President, today Senator Herb Kohl and I are introducing the Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act. In my State and many others, elderly Americans--as a condition of their being admitted to a nursing home--are unfairly asked to agree to arbitrate any claims they may have against that nursing home before their claim actually occurs. This is not only unfair to those seeking residence, but it is also unfair to their families, who often times have no choice but to forfeit  their loved one's legal rights in order to find them the care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The basis for arbitration is accorded under the Federal Arbitration Act, FAA, which Congress enacted in 1925. The FAA was intended to allow parties an alternative forum to efficiently resolve business disputes. But over time, the FAA has expanded into nonbusiness disputes, including those involving nursing homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation I am introducing today is in keeping with the FAA's original intent by requiring that agreements to arbitrate nursing home disputes be made after the dispute has arisen--not before prospective residents move in. While this bill won't prevent arbitration from occurring, it will prevent nursing home corporations with greater bargaining power from forcing residents to enter into pre-dispute arbitration through a non-negotiable contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trend we are seeing at far too many nursing homes around the country is an unwarranted intrusion into a vulnerable population's right to access the civil justice system. This bill protects those who are otherwise unprotected, and helps to give their families peace of mind in knowing their loved ones are able to retain their full legal rights should they be abused or injured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud my colleague, Senator Kohl for recognizing the egregious injustices happening in nursing homes around the Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support this necessary bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Martinez to introduce the Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act of 2008. This legislation is a narrowly targeted measure that protects nursing home residents, one of our Nation's most vulnerable populations, from losing the right to hold nursing homes accountable in court for negligent and abusive care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The process of admission to a long-term care facility is traumatic for the prospective resident and their family. Often these facilities are a last resort for families and residents, and many times these decisions are arrived at under desperate, and sometimes emergency, circumstances. Even admission to an assisted-living facility by a relatively healthy senior citizen is a stressful and emotional event. Adding to the difficulty, many families face limited options in nursing care when it comes  to both geographic location and the level of care required for their loved one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the admissions process, prospective residents and their families have little choice other than to accept the terms of the admission agreement with no ability to negotiate. Many facilities now require residents, or their responsible family members, to sign contracts that include predispute mandatory arbitration agreements. This means that any dispute between the resident and the facility will automatically be subject to arbitration. In other words, by agreeing to the contract, and before  a dispute ever arises, they are unwittingly signing away their constitutional right to have their case heard by an impartial judge or jury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike other uses of arbitration, arbitration in the nursing home context is usually related to health care and often involves cases of abuse and neglect that result in serious injuries or death. While civil court proceedings are generally open to the public, most arbitration requires that all parts of the process be kept confidential. As a result, long term care facilities are not held publicly accountable for their substandard care. Even worse, this potentially lifesaving information may be  concealed from current and prospective residents, regulatory agencies, and the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another troubling aspect of arbitration clauses in nursing home admissions agreements is that they are often buried in long contracts and presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, without any opportunity to negotiate. While some facilities may attempt to explain the meaning of the arbitration clause and make it seem voluntary, the focus of the admissions process is on the loved one in need of care and not on these technical legal aspects of the agreement. Family members of prospective residents,  whether or not they understand the arbitration provision, feel compelled to sign it in order to ensure that their loved one will be admitted and that their care will not be compromised by their refusal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of many tragic examples we have learned about is the case of Ella Needham. After being hospitalized with a urinary tract infection, she was taken to a nursing home by her daughter. During the hasty admissions process, her daughter signed a mandatory arbitration agreement. Both were unaware that they were signing away their constitutional right to a jury trial. During Ella's stay, the nursing home staff abused her, failed to adequately hydrate her, and did not adequately treat her illness.  As a result of this negligence and abuse, Mrs. Needham died. When her daughter sued the home, she discovered that she was not allowed to go to court because of the arbitration agreement. After months of litigation challenging the agreement, the appeals court upheld the requirement to arbitrate. The daughter was forced to settle her claims of abuse and neglect in arbitration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that our bill does not preclude arbitration as an option for resolving disputes between nursing home residents and long term care facilities. The legislation simply says that families and prospective residents cannot be forced into arbitration through a nonnegotiable contract prior to the dispute. This will ensure that arbitration is a voluntary forum to resolve these unique disputes that can have far reaching consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
