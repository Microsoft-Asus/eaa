    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Teresa Kirkeeng-Kincaid, a remarkable civil servant who dedicated her entire career to making her community, the Upper Mississippi River Region and our Nation a better place. Teresa passed away last week at the young age of 48, after a courageous battle against cancer. Her legacy, however, will continue long into the future. Teresa dedicated her entire professional life to working for the Federal Government. Teresa joined the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers as a civil engineer with the Rock Island District in 1981, and continued with the Corps for 26 years. In that time, she served in many roles, including assistant chief of the planning, program and project management division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her two and a half decades of service, Teresa earned a reputation on the Upper Mississippi Region and across the Nation as a person of great dedication and integrity. She played a leadership role in important projects including formulating navigation, flood damage, and ecosystem restoration projects throughout the entire Upper Mississippi River basin. She was the "go to person" throughout the Corps of Engineers on numerous planning issues. The team she led reestablished the Corps' Planning  Associates program to train future planners for the Corps, a legacy that will last for many decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the occasion to meet Teresa several times, and know the very high regard in which she was held by her coworkers, her countless friends, and her loving family. She will be missed.</paragraph>
