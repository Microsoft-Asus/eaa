  <narrative>AHMADINEJAD AND COLUMBIA -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10700]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know, there is quite a bit of disgust with what is taking place in New York City today with Ahmadinejad at Columbia University. There is disgust also with the United Nations. And rightfully so. And we are hearing from our constituents about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then to top it off, the New York Times, who for 2 weeks denied that they gave special price breaks to moveon.org for the liberal group's ad attacking General Petraeus, finally yesterday through their public editor or their ombudsman had to come clean with the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, indeed, moveon.org should have paid $142,000 for that ad, but somehow it was cut in half. The reduced price was a mistake, they said, and they admitted they had violated their own advertising policy of barring attacks of a personal nature. Two pretty glaring mistakes, don't you think?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Times claims it is not a poster child for the liberal media, but in the recent admission that sometimes reporters had fabricated stories while management cut a deal to a liberal attack group and violated their own ethics, well, as my grandmother would say, their little actions sure are speaking a lot louder than their words. Bless their little hearts.</paragraph>
