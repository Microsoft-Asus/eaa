    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the United States Army Reserve. On this date, we should take a moment to honor their proud tradition of service and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Reserve was first established by President Theodore Roosevelt on April 23, 1908, when he signed into law the Medical Reserve Corps. Four years later, the Regular Army Reserve was established, and they have gone on to duty and served in every major conflict operation of the last century. America's Army Reserve has served in both world wars, the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and in Iraq and Afghanistan as the central fronts of the global war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a veteran of the Army Reserve, the 460th Replacement Detachment of Florence, South Carolina, and the 815th Personnel Service Company of Orangeburg, South Carolina, I wish to express my immense gratitude for the hard work and dedication of our Reserve soldiers. Our Nation is safer because of their sacrifice. The best way to protect American families is to defeat terrorism overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
