  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on June 22, our Nation lost a great judge and lawyer, civil rights champion, and public servant. Justice Revius Ortique, the first African-American justice elected to the Louisiana Supreme Court, has died at 84.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met Justice Ortique when we served together in the 1970s on the board of the Legal Services Corporation, and much later in his career, Justice Ortique was appointed by my husband to serve as alternate delegate to the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Ortique had an illustrious career. In World War II, he served as an officer in the Pacific Theater and after earning his law degree in 1956, set up a legal practice at the vanguard of the civil rights movement. He helped to successfully win equal pay for Black employees in several cases, to integrate State labor unions, and served five terms as president of the Urban League of Greater New Orleans. Justice Ortique not only worked to achieve racial equality but also to achieve racial harmony  and served three terms as president of the New Orleans Community Relations Council. He negotiated for the Black community with White civic leaders helping to bring about the peaceful desegregation of lunch counters, bathrooms, and other public facilities in New Orleans before the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 would guarantee these rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice Ortique was a courtly figure with a mild manner that belied his courage, convictions, and ability to effect change. I am proud to have known him, and my thoughts and prayers are with his wife Miriam, his daughter Rhesa, and all those whose lives were made better because of his leadership.</paragraph>
