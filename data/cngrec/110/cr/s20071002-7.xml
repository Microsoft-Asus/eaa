  <narrative>BURMA -- (Senate - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12389">S12389</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the British statesman Edmund Burke once wrote: "When bad men combine, the good must associate." Such vivid moral clarity is nowhere better reflected than in the recent events involving Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Burma, we have indeed witnessed the combination of bad men--a combination of corrupt military junta leaders and compliant thugs in the Burmese security forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This combination recently carried out the brutal suppression of peaceful protests in Burma, killing and imprisoning untold numbers of nonviolent demonstrators, including scores of Buddhist monks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is now needed is for the good to associate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The global struggle against terrorism has compelled us to increase our foreign policy engagement in places such as the Horn of Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the coming decades, we must realize that China and India are two countries that will play a larger role on the world stage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One would have hoped that as India takes on a greater role as a regional power, and as a growing economic power, that pro-democracy elements within Burma could look to associate with its next-door neighbor, the largest democracy on the planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is pursuing a closer relationship with India in terms of military-to-military contacts and in the development of nuclear energy. India should be wary of coddling the junta in Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, recently put out a strong statement condemning the brutality in Burma. Instead of echoing the sentiments of Burma's ASEAN neighbors, the Indian Government has only issued tepid statements at best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In so doing, India has put itself in league with China and Russia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is all the more troubling since India had been supportive of Burmese reformers in the early 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As India assumes a greater role on the world stage, more will be asked of it, and this is just such a case. India needs to recognize that responsibility and abstain from supporting the military junta in Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>India needs to use its influence as Asia's longest-lived democracy to associate with the pro-democracy forces of Burma and press for reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Understandably, India has important interests in its neighbor to the east. For one, India wants to counter the influence of China in Burma. That said, it should look beyond its near-term interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What better way to blunt Chinese influence in Burma than to work to bring about a Burma that reflects the Indian values of democracy and openness, rather than a Burma that reflects the antidemocratic values of the Chinese Government?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I strongly urge the Indian Government to reconsider its position on Burma; to speak directly to the regime's recent actions; and to work for the cause of democracy and reconciliation in Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only then can the combination of bad men leading Burma be checked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
