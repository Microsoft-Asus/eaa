  <narrative>LET'S NOT OVERSTAY OUR WELCOME IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7998]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last night the Senate stayed in session and they're probably still in session because they can't get an agreement to discuss the resolution, the bill that this House has already passed, a similar one to end the war in Iraq and redeploy our troops and bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House, on several occasions, has passed bills with benchmarks to respond to the American people's wishes and end this horrific war. The Senate hasn't been able to do it because they need 60 votes to avoid filibuster. That's what they have going on now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's the problem, Mr. Speaker, is the procedures in the Senate, and that's why we're still in this horrific war, a war where the Prime Minister of Iraq has said he can provide for the security of his country by January 1 and he does not need our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that Emily Post's rule should be invoked. When you're a visitor and your host says you're no longer needed and no longer wanted, you pack your bags and you go home. I would advise the President, Mr. Speaker, to listen to Emily Post and be a good visitor and bring our troops home and stop losing lives needlessly.</paragraph>
