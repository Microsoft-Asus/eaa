  <narrative>ATROPHY OF THE BALANCE OF POWERS -- (Senate - November 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10545">S10545</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the 2 years since I have been privileged to be in this body, I have spoken frequently about my concerns with respect to the balance of power between the executive branch and the legislative branch and the atrophy of the powers and the influence of the Congress. There are two issues that are before us this week that I think illuminate the dangers of that atrophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first is in respect to the powers we gave to the Secretary of Treasury in our vote at the beginning of October, before we went into recess, as he addressed the issues of the bailout. Many Senators, including myself, wrote letters of concern immediately after this bailout was proposed, noting that it was unprecedented for one individual in the executive branch of Government to be given the broad discretion the present Secretary of the Treasury has been given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted to support this bailout, as did most of my colleagues, as we were assured, not only by members of the administration, but also with a great deal of hesitation by members of our own party in the Senate, that this was an essential act to avert an international calamity in the financial markets. We were told by the Secretary of the Treasury that we needed to reinforce the good will and the concerns people had by allowing him to take certain actions. We ensured oversight over the Secretary  of the Treasury, but he still retained the total discretion that has been used over the past several weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we all know now--it has been said several times already this afternoon--the decisions that were made, as to where this money has been going, were not in line with the reassurances that were given this body when the legislation was brought forward. There has been a great deal of inconsistency coming from the Secretary of Treasury, and it has created a mood of unpredictability that we have seen reflected in the markets and in the confidence of investors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would agree with the concept that was recently put forward by the Senator from Oklahoma about slowing down the amount of money that is available to be spent under this bailout. I also would propose, in examining legislation to that effect, that we as a body revisit the whole idea of giving this kind of power to one individual in the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are plenty of precedents in history which create a small body of honest brokers, perhaps three individuals who collectively can make decisions for the good of the country and who would not be burdened by conflict of interests because of their own background, either real or imagined, or the burden that goes with the discretion of one individual. I hope to place something to that effect before this body relatively soon. I hope other Members of the Congress will consider that idea as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second issue with respect to the abrogation of power by the legislative branch to the executive branch concerns the relationship that we are now about to finalize with Iraq. We have seen it reported in the media today that the Iraqi Cabinet has given a near unanimous agreement to a strategic framework agreement--which is very little discussed, and a status of forces agreement--which has been much debated, that ostensibly would define the future relationship between the United States and Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it more than ironic, and I have mentioned it several times on this floor, that the Congress has not been invited to participate in this process. The Iraqi Cabinet is going to present this agreement to the Iraqi Parliament for a vote. The Congress of the United States is hardly even getting a look.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you turn to article II, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, it says the President:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, Is this a treaty? It is going to define the long-term relationship between the United States and Iraq in a situation where we are going to have military bases of some sort in Iraq and a security relationship with Iraq. That sounds quite a bit like a treaty to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has been claiming this is simply an executive agreement and, as a result, the Secretary of State can sign this; the Congress can be consulted but does not have to have a vote. But let us remember, at the end of this year, on December 31, the legal authority for the United States to be operating in Iraq ends under international law with the expiration of the U.N. mandate. So under what authority, legal authority, will we be operating in Iraq? An executive agreement is only constitutional  when it is implementing a law. So what law or constitutional authority will this executive agreement be implementing?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The members of the administration, when I raised this issue nearly 8 months ago, claimed that the 2002 authorization to go to war in Iraq was their legal authorization to negotiate an executive agreement looking to the future relationships in Iraq. I have strong questions about that. First, if the 2002 authorization to go to war would be good in terms of an executive agreement to define our future relationship, then why did we even need the U.N. mandate in the first place? The second is, the  2002 authorization to go to war in Iraq took place at a time when the present Government of Iraq did not even exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would state my strong belief, again, that the Congress needs to assert its constitutional authority on this matter. The Congress needs to concur with the strategic framework agreement in order for us as a nation under the Constitution to properly define our relationship with a government and a country where we are going to have military forces in place, and where we are going to have security guarantees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that regard, I conclude by stating my strong hope that the incoming administration, under President-elect Obama, will, early on, take a comprehensive diplomatic approach to all the issues that affect the United States in that particularly troublesome spot in the world. We should be fostering the right kind of diplomatic environment with other countries such as Russia and China that have interests in this region. We should be exploring ways to formally and aggressively explore our relationships  with countries such as Iran. We need to put the whole issue of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and other countries in the Middle East on the table early on and forcibly. Reality indicates and history proves that the longer the new administration waits, the more strongly they</paragraph>
