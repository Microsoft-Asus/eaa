  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday's Democratic National Summit on America's Children underscored the need to keep critical investments in preschool education for children today so that society does not pay a higher price later. A new Joint Economic Committee report shows that investing in high quality education is a cost-effective way of improving the life circumstances of children, while also increasing the U.S. economic growth over the long term by as much as 3.5 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another report details the provisions in Federal and State tax codes that are available to help families with children. The credits offered by my home State of New York are among the most generous. Both reports are available on the JEC website.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investing in our Nation's children not only helps them, but also helps produce an innovative workforce for the future and keeps our economy strong.</paragraph>
