  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill>, the Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing Act of 2008, or the COVERT Act of 2008, was introduced by Congresswoman Lowey of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The COVERT Act of 2008 was introduced to eliminate the practice of giving advance notice to transportation security workers of covert tests before the tests happened. I want to thank Congresswoman Lowey and the other members of the Committee on Homeland Security for working together in a bipartisan manner to approve this measure unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the Transportation Security Administration for recognizing the need for this legislation and working with us to ensure that the bill accomplishes its goal without impeding the way in which TSA conducts its covert testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is vital to protecting the integrity of covert tests of transportation security systems. We know of at least three incidents where covert tests were compromised by individuals who inappropriately warned security officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will prohibit individuals from providing advance notice of these important covert tests to any persons, unless authorized to do so by the Assistant Secretary of TSA, the Inspector General of DHS, or the Comptroller General of GAO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Covert testing efforts by TSA, the DHS IG, and GAO have helped to increase the effectiveness of our transportation security systems by highlighting vulnerabilities and keeping the screening workforce on their toes. Any effort to compromise these important testing efforts, whether intentional or accidental, should not be tolerated by this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we choose to ignore the problems of the past, we will provide future opportunities to compromise a worthy program intended to educate the workforce and benefit the security of our transportation security systems throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill>, which complements the work the committee has done on <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the DHS authorization bill that is pending before the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill>, the Catching Operational  Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing Act of 2008, otherwise known as the COVERT Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act simply would prohibit the disclosure of information concerning a covert test conducted by TSA, the Inspector General of DHS, or GAO to any individual prior to the completion of the test. The bill also requires any TSA covert testing team to be accompanied by a cover team to monitor the covert test and to confirm the identity of the covert testing team to any appropriate individual, if an individual or security screener not aware of the covert test identifies the covert testing team as  a threat to security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is substantially modified from the bill as originally introduced because there was some real give-and-take and compromise produced on the part of both sides of the aisle at the subcommittee level and with the full committee staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And for that I am thankful and believe that we have a better product as a result of that consultation and that give and take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things we wanted to make sure we did not do in attempting to prevent people spilling the beans, so to speak, on these kinds of covert tests was to have such a heavy-handed approach that it might tip off people by the presence of additional folks. We've worked that out here, and I thank the gentleman and the gentlelady for being able to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just have one small point, perhaps disagreement with the chairman. There are reports that there was a tipping off in one particular instance that was intentional, seemingly meant to give people notice that there was going to be a test or it was about to take place. In another case, at least from my review of the files, it appears to be inadvertent, and I believe something on the order of within 30 seconds the notice that was contained in an e-mail was retrieved by the responsible party  when he realized someone else had put that out. And then there's a third one that's somewhat in dispute between TSA and some Members of the House, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And all I would say is, irrespective of how many there were, if there was just one, that's one too many. This bill I think helps us move in the direction of improving the circumstances so the likelihood of that occurring is much less in the future than it would have been without this legislation. And so for those reasons, I would enthusiastically support <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill> and ask my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the author and supporter of this legislation, the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Lowey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill> and begin by thanking Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King, Subcommittee Chairwoman Jackson-Lee, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Lungren for moving this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill, the Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing, or COVERT, Act would prohibit the advance notification of covert tests on transportation systems without direct approval from the highest officials in our Homeland Security operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation bolsters accountability and integrity for covert testing within our transportation systems overseen by the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The core principles and goals of covert testing are undermined when individuals are alerted in advance that a test or evaluation is imminent. In fact, in case we haven't figured it out, there is nothing covert about activities employees already know will occur. Unfortunately, there have been a number of reported incidents in which covert tests may have been compromised as a result of advanced notification to Transportation Security officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security found that between August 2003 and May 2004, Transportation Security Administration officials at San Francisco International Airport compromised covert testing efforts by tracking testers throughout the airport utilizing surveillance cameras, then notifying screening personnel in advance of the testers arriving at security checkpoints. The Inspector General also found that Transportation Security officers at Jackson-Evers International  Airport in Jackson, Mississippi, reported receiving advance notice of covert tests conducted by TSA's Office of Inspection on February 12, 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, led by Chairman Thompson's efforts, the Homeland Security Committee discovered on April 2006 an e-mail sent via TSA's net hub system from the Office of Security Operations to all Federal security directors and other TSA airport officials informing them of testing at airports throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this unfortunate instance, while the e-mail may have violated TSA protocols, it did not constitute the sharing of sensitive information under the law. My legislation will close that loophole, making it a violation to tip off employees before covert tests without high-level approval at TSA and DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During mark-up of this legislation, the Homeland Security Committee adopted an amendment allowing local law enforcement to be notified prior to a test if directed by the administrator providing for personnel flexibility by clarifying that only one individual is necessary to serve as a cover agent supervising testing, and including a study on implementation of these procedures and their impact on the Department's effort to improve transportation security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make it very clear to my colleagues that this bill does not tie the hands of DHS or TSA. It simply ensures that any decision to notify personnel in advance must come directly from the TSA administrator, the Inspector General of the Department, or the Comptroller General at GAO to ensure the safety of the traveling public and the testers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlelady an additional minute.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will probably need an additional 4 minutes to respond, if you have it, Mr. Chairman, to Mr. Lungren on this very, very important issue that he has been referencing concerning drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've been hearing frequently from my colleagues, my good friends like Mr. Lungren, from President Bush, and from other Republicans in the Congress. They continue to argue that opening more of the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas drilling will lower gasoline prices. But we can't drill our way to energy independence. The United States has only 1.6 percent of the world's oil reserves, but Americans consume 25 percent of the oil used around the world every day. Nearly 80 percent of  oil and 82 percent of natural gas believed to exist on the Outer Continental Shelf is located in areas that are now open for leasing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The time of the gentlewoman has expired.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlelady an additional 3 minutes to complete her statement.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only 10.5 million of the 44 million leased offshore acres are actually producing oil or gas. So oil companies, my colleagues, are reaping billions in record profits, $123 billion in 2007 alone, received billions in subsidies in the 2005 energy bill, but they are not using the Federal lands already open to development. Given this, opening sensitive areas to drilling makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, ExxonMobil made $40 billion in profits last year alone, but has only increased investment in drilling and production by $3 billion over the last 5 years. Oil and gas companies have stockpiled 9,000 drilling permits--9,000--my good friends--drilling permits--without expanding domestic production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New Direction Congress is working to make America more energy independent and secure, lower costs to consumers, grow our economy with hundreds of thousands of new green jobs, and reduce global warming. This Congress has fought for historic new commitments to American-grown biofuels, sustained investments in clean renewable energy, large-scale efficiency improvements to buildings and  transportation, enhanced tools to crack down on OPEC price fixing  and price gouging, and to investigate the effects on price of rampant commodity speculation. And this Congress has forced the President to increase supply and thereby lower costs by not continuing to fill the almost full Strategic Petroleum Reserve starting June 30.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm sure this debate will continue, my colleagues. And it seems to be a mantra of many of my good friends on the other side of the aisle, but I do wish there would be more focus on the oil companies using the drilling leases that they have and taking some of those profits and investing them and producing the oil that we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank you, I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend on the other side of the aisle for focusing on this issue. I'm sure we'll continue this discussion. But I would like to conclude by thanking everybody, because it has been a bipartisan effort, and I encourage support of <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>May I inquire as to how much time I have remaining?</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from California has 17 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill>, the Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing Act of 2008. I just wish we had the Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Real Energy Production in this Country Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlelady from New York has suggested that it's almost insignificant what we do offshore and that we are not actually going after those things right now. Well, let me just put some facts on the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.S. Minerals Management Service--not a Republican or Democratic operation--America's deep seas on the Outer Continental Shelf contain 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Now, to put that in perspective, the United States consumes 23 trillion cubic feet per year; so 20 times, almost, what we get per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And 86 billion barrels of oil contained in the deep seas on the Outer Continental Shelf; 86 billion barrels of oil, and currently the U.S. imports 4.5 billion barrels of oil per year. So that's about the equivalent of a little less than 20 years of our imports. But 85 percent of the lower 48 Outer Continental Shelf energy resources remain under the lock and key of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why do I say this deals with operational vulnerabilities? We have said in this bill that if you tip off people that they're being investigated, they might not act as they normally do. They might take advantage of you because they know that you are doing these covert operations. Similarly, we are the only developed Nation in the world that forbids safe energy production on our Outer Continental Shelf. No other country in the world does that. Brazil just explored on theirs, and they found  the largest single gas find in modern history. In fact, some people are saying that Brazil will now be energy independent and not even have to deal with their ethanol production by way of sugar. Oh, by the way, we could be importing ethanol from sugar from Brazil at much lower costs than ethanol produced by corn in the United States. We have a 53 cent per gallon subsidy for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even though Brazil is the leader in the world in ethanol produced by sugar, it went ahead and explored on their Outer Continental Shelf. And what did they find? The largest single find. Now, if you had looked a year ago or 2 years ago about the proven reserves for Brazil, that would not even be there because we didn't know about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing is, with technology, already known fields can produce more than they ever did before. One of the reasons I have a little bit of knowledge of this, I grew up in Long Beach, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We have been producing offshore Long Beach since before I was born. Every single citizen of the State of California who has any interest in the schools of California is proud of the fact, frankly, that there are subsidies that go to our schools from the royalties paid as a result of producing offshore Long Beach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we haven't had a major oil spill in my lifetime. We have I think over 1,000 rigs in the gulf coast that have been sitting there during these tremendous storms that we call hurricanes, including Katrina, that came through that area in the last few years. Not a single drop of oil has resulted, even though we have had massive destruction of all other kinds of facilities in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States companies, that some on this floor have berated, have spent billions of dollars in development of new technology to make it safer. And the suggestion that somehow they are hiding, somehow they are not utilizing these leases that they have, is just a fantastic claim, because it is utterly preposterous that they would pay money for leases and then not try to see what is there. The fact of the matter is that 52 percent of the oil and gas wells that have been drilled by American  companies, 52 percent over the last 5 years, have turned out dry. Now, did they get these leases because they wanted to find dry wells? No. They went because there is a certain risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not as easy as is suggested on this floor of the House that, okay, I am an oil company. I make money. I have friends who have worked on oil rigs who are missing fingers from the work that goes on there. I have friends that have worked in South and Central America who have worked on rigs at all time using what is called drilling mud, using those drill bits, losing fingers, working hard at it, realizing that you don't have a guarantee of every time you put a well down, you are going to get  oil up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just find it fantastic that in this argument, number one, we are told, well, we don't have that much oil. It is really the fault of Americans because they use so much oil. I don't know whether that sells too much, blaming Americans for using energy that allows their lives to be better than our parents' and grandparents' generation was in terms of the standard of living. And secondly, to berate American companies that are leaders in the world in technology around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is strange to me that some on the other side of the aisle believe that it is important for us to make sure we don't have any Outer Continental Shelf drilling off Florida, for instance, when Cuba has lease agreements with a number of countries, including China, although they haven't yet started to drill, that would allow them to drill within either 45 miles or 60 miles of our Florida coast. Now maybe it makes sense to tell the American people that they are at fault. I don't believe they are  at fault. I think they are looking at us for some solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a solution here to the problem of the possibility of tipping people off to testing. It makes no sense to me, and most on my side of the aisle, for us to be the only developed nation in the world tipping off the rest of the world that we are going to close off most of our areas of natural resources. Remember, when we got Alaska, some referred to it as Seward's Folly. Maybe we didn't realize the folly until now when we intentionally cut off our ability to be able to environmentally and  safely explore and produce energy in Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we divert a little bit from this bill. This bill is the Catching Operational Vulnerabilities By Ensuring Random Testing Act of 2008, COVERT testing. I congratulate the gentlelady for bringing this bill forward. I congratulate the chairwoman of the subcommittee for working on this along with those of us on this side. I congratulate the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Mississippi, for bringing this forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I cannot emphasize how important these covert tests are to  protecting the country's transportation security systems. A single tip-off of a covert test is too many. We have already had three we know of. We must do our part to stop the next one from happening. We must do whatever we can to ensure that these tests remain covert and candid so we can truly evaluate our transportation security workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues as we move forward on this important legislation that will make our transportation systems more secure. I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5909">H.R. 5909</bill>, Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing Act of 2008, introduced by my distinguished colleague from New York, Representative Lowe. This important legislation will further shore up the gaps in our testing and evaluation protocols for transportation security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we've seen just in the past year, the details of covert tests and evaluations have been disseminated to the screener workforce, thereby "tipping-off' those we are trying to accurately and responsibly test. The Committee on Homeland Security has been extremely concerned about this issue and I have held hearings in the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection, of which I am the chair, in order to examine what exactly has gone wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any efforts to compromise these important testing efforts, whether intentional or on accident, should not be tolerated. Some have claimed that one of these incidents--the April 2006 e-mail from TSA's Office of Security Operations that tipped TSA field staff off to covert tests--was unintentional, but evidence suggests otherwise. The April 2006 e-mail clearly referenced that individuals who were probing the system were Federal employees and even provided a physical description of one of the employees  conducting the tests. This bill is necessary to prohibit individuals from providing advance notice of covert tests to any persons, unless authorized to do so by the Assistant Secretary of the Transportation Security Administration, the Inspector General of the Department, or the Comptroller General of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The COVERT Act of 2008 explicitly prohibits the advance notice or notification to individuals by those employees who are participating in a covert test or evaluation, which will ensure that the integrity of all covert testing efforts--across all modes of transportation--are protected, not just aviation. This legislation puts in place controls to monitor the testing personnel and the testing and evaluation procedures by building in accountability. It establishes the presence of a second team of  covert test and evaluation employees with the first team in order to monitor and confirm their actions.
