  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in support of a resolution designating April 25, 2008, as "Global Youth Service Day." This resolution recognizes and commends the significant community service efforts that youth are making in communities across the country and around the world on April 25 and every day. This resolution also encourages the citizens of the United States to acknowledge and support these volunteer efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the weekend beginning this Friday, April 25, youth from across the United States and around the world will carry out community service projects in areas ranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. Through this service, many will embark on a lifelong path of service and civic engagement in more than 100 countries around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This event is not isolated to one weekend a year. Global Youth Service Day is an annual public awareness and education campaign that highlights the valuable contributions that young people make to their communities throughout the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the participation of youth in community service is not just a "nice idea" for a way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Youth who are engaged in volunteer service and service-learning activities do better in school than their classmates who do not volunteer. Youth who engage in volunteering and other positive activities are also more likely to avoid risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use, crime, and promiscuity. Service within the community also contributes positively to young  people's character development, civic participation, and better understanding of the needs of their neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent survey by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent of high school dropouts reported that boredom in school was a primary reason why they dropped out. High quality service-learning activities can, however, help young people make important connections between the curriculum and the challenges they see in their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important, therefore, that the United States Senate encourage youth to engage in community service and to congratulate them for the service they provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to recognize and support youth volunteers in my State, I am proud to acknowledge some of the activities that will occur this year in Alaska in observance of National and Global Youth Service Day:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. Anchorage's Promise, which works to mobilize all sectors of the community to build the character and competence of Anchorage's children and youth, is again sponsoring the annual Kids' Day three-day events in Anchorage this year. Youth will provide significant service to their peers and to adults who attend Kids' Day activities: Students from King Career Center will serve as volunteer safety patrols. Students from the University of Alaska Anchorage will serve as greeters. Members of the West  High School Junior ROTC will provide security. The youth members of the American Co-Ed Pageants will serve as entertainment directors. Students at Chugiak High School will help their younger peers with bicycle and seatbelt safety demonstrations. Youth volunteers at the Imaginiarium</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the Kids' Day events, young people from every region of Alaska will serve their communities in the following ways:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. Young members of the Kiwanis Key Club will, through the RYLA Youth Leadership program, perform various service projects from March through May.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>3. Alaska Youth for Environmental Action will sponsor A Week Without Plastics activities in Anchorage, Palmer, Fairbanks, Juneau, Homer, Yakutat, and Sitka. Youth organizers will help educate their communities, through various outreach activities, on the effects of plastics on our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4. Youth in the Anchorage School District will host a dance to raise funds for economically disadvantaged students who do not qualify for a free or reduced price school lunch; make daily checks for recyclable items, and hold a fundraiser for lymphoma and leukemia research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>5. In partnership with the Anchorage Municipal Libraries, youth will help organize the city's summer reading program and materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>6. In partnership with Covenant House and Congregation Beth Shalom, young people in Anchorage will involve their peers in transforming old T-shirts into reusable grocery bags.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>7. 4-H and other youth volunteers, in partnership with the Alaska Zoo in Anchorage, will provide plastics education information and participate in the planting of trees for Earth Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>8. In Ketchikan, the Boys and Girls Club will sponsor a city-wide clean-up involving many elementary, middle schools and high school students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>9. From January through May, young people whose parents are stationed at  Elmendorf Air Force Base have been involved in monthly service projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>10. Members of Camp Fire at Highland Tech will sponsor a student contest between the advisory teams within the school to see who can bring in the most plastic to recycle. Each student who participates will receive a reusable shopping bag from Fred Meyer. Students will also hold a Safety Fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>11. In Nome, Alaska, the student council will sponsor the annual food drive, open the local food bank, and go house to house to gather food for the needy in the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>12. The Nome Junior ROTC will gather seeds for the school's greenhouse and prepare plantings in the old gold dredges around town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>13. In Juneau, youth members of the Ethics and Leadership program will make ceramic bowls that will be donated to the Glory Hole, Juneau's homeless shelter and soup kitchen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>14. From January through May, members of the Mayor's Youth Commission in Anchorage select a volunteer project that will impact the Municipality for the One Good Deed program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>15. Youth members of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council in Anchorage reach out to the community at large through the Native Games Community Outreach project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>16. The Mediak Video, Radio, and Magazine Clubs of Anchorage will sponsor a Spring Quarter Movie Night, create Public Service Announcements for radio station KNBA, and complete the 8th edition of Alaska Aloud, the only magazine written by and for Alaska Native students in the Anchorage area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so proud of all of these young people. I value their idealism, energy, creativity, and unique perspectives as they volunteer to make their communities better and assist those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many similarly wonderful activities will be taking place all across the Nation. I encourage all of my colleagues to visit the Youth Service America Web site--www.ysa.org--to find out about the selfless and creative youth who are contributing in their own States this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues--Senators Akaka, Bayh, Boxer, Brown, Burr, Cantwell, Cardin, Casey, Clinton, Cochran, Coleman, Collins, Craig, Dodd, Dole, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Gregg, Inouye, Isakson, Kennedy, Kerry, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman,</paragraph>
