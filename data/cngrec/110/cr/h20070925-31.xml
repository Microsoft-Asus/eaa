  <narrative>STRENGTHENING THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10763]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when President Bush was running for re-election in 2004, one of the major promises he made during his acceptance speech at the Republican Convention was to strengthen the Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back then, the compassionately conservative President vowed to, and I'm quoting now, "lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance program."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's exactly what this Congress has done. A bipartisan agreement that comes to the floor today would enroll more than 4 million more children in the Children's Health Insurance Program who are already eligible. And based on his past statement, you would think that President Bush would be praising this agreement. He is not. In fact, he's threatening to veto the bill because he says that we are trying to expand the program beyond its original intent. That's just wrong. Our bipartisan agreement  does nothing more than what he vowed to do back in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder than words. The President should follow through with his promise and support our efforts to ensure 10 million children have access to health care.</paragraph>
