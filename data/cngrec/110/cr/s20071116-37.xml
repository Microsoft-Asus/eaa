  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="CONGRATULATING DR. SCOTT D. MILLER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commend a true leader, someone who has left an indelible impression on thousands of Delaware's college students. Dr. Scott D. Miller, after 10 years at the helm of Wesley College in Dover, is moving on to the next phase in his professional life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Miller's tenure at Wesley has been marked by previously unknown success. He took over a quiet school in our State capital and turned it into a nationally recognized institution with a burgeoning and diverse student population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Evidence of his quick influence is the fact that Wesley was named as one of just four "amazing turnarounds" featured in the book, "The Small College Guide to Financial Health," after only 5 years of Dr. Miller at the helm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Miller's accomplishments are too numerous to name in one statement, but I would like to mention a few of the most notable:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wesley's faculty is stronger in number and diversity, which has improved the retention rate and academic profile of Wesley's student body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enrollment has nearly tripled in the 10 years Dr. Miller has been president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has presided over the most prolific fundraising era in Wesley's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he has developed community service partnerships for his students with five campus-based affiliates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Wesley College has been changed permanently--and for the better--by Dr. Miller's leadership and vision. My State's oldest private college will retain its prominence for years to come, thanks to Dr. Miller's guidance in leading that institution into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Scott Miller is moving on, being rewarded for his excellent work over the last decade, and he will surely be missed. But his efforts will not soon be forgotten in Dover, surely not among all of the lives that he touched.</paragraph>
