    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1539">S. 1539</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill honoring and memorializing a fallen Iowa hero. Scott Nisely had served his country in Iraq just short of a year when, on September 30, 2006, he was killed in combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scott Nisely served his country in many capacities during his lifetime. He devoted his life to his family, church, and country and has positively affected numerous lives. Scott Nisely's military service includes about 25 years with the U.S. Marine Corps, starting as an ROTC student, then 12 years on active duty, almost 9 years in the Marine Corps Reserve during which he achieved the rank of major. Most recently, he took a significant decrease in rank to serve his country once again in the Iowa  Army National Guard for about 4 years until he was killed in combat. His public service also includes 12 years with the U.S. Postal Service. In addition, Scott served his community by his participation in the First Baptist Church's music ministry as</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of this devoted family man and public servant, the bill I am introducing with the support of my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, would name the post office located at 309 East Linn Street in Marshalltown, IA, the Major Scott Nisely Post Office. The idea came from Scott's coworkers at the Marshalltown Post Office and it is indeed a fitting tribute. Representative Latham is introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives today with the support  of the other members of Iowa's House delegation. I am pleased to be able to propose this small token of recognition and gratitude for someone who has given so much to his country, and I urge its swift consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I join with my senior colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, in introducing a bill to name the Marshalltown Post Office in honor of MAJ Scott Nisely, who was killed in action in Iraq on September 30, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Nisely enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1981 and served in Operation Desert Storm. In 1994, he moved to Marshalltown, IA, with his family and worked at the Iowa Veterans Home as well as at the Marshalltown and Des Moines Post Offices. Because of his love for his country and the military, Major Nisely took a demotion to join the Iowa National Guard and was sent to Iraq in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Nisely was a dedicated husband and father, beloved for his sense of humor and positive attitude. Having served in Operation Desert Storm, he was already a respected Marine veteran and a hero to his family and friends. But with our Armed Forces engaged in Iraq, he once again felt compelled to fight for his country. Major Nisely served in two wars, set a sterling example of selfless service to country, and paid the ultimate price while fighting in Iraq. I am proud to join my colleague in  naming the post office in Marshalltown the Major Scott Nisely Post Office, in honor of this fallen hero.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="Introducing S. 1540. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for the transportation of food for charitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1540">S. 1540</bill>] Mr. President, today is the sixth National Hunger Awareness Day--a day to reflect on the fact that in this Nation alone more than 35 million people are experiencing hunger or are at risk for hunger. It is also a day to recognize the tremendous efforts of individuals who graciously give their time and resources to help those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunger is far too prevalent, but I think Washington Post columnist David Broder hit the nail on the head when he wrote: "America has some problems that defy solution. This one does not. It just needs caring people and a caring government, working together." I agree, the battle to end hunger in our country is a campaign that cannot be won in months or even a few years, but it is a victory within reach. And I am motivated to do what I can to make a positive difference in this fight against hunger--both  in the United States and beyond our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America--the land of prosperity and plenty--some people have the misconception that hunger plagues only far-away, undeveloped nations. The reality is that hunger is a silent enemy lurking within 1 in 10 U.S. households. In my home State of North Carolina alone, nearly 1 million of our 8.8 million residents are struggling with food security issues. In recent years, once-thriving North Carolina towns have been economically crippled by the shuttering of textile mills and furniture factories.  People have lost their jobs--and sometimes their ability to put food on the table. I know this scenario is not unique to North Carolina, as many American manufacturing jobs have moved overseas. While many folks are finding new employment, these days a steady income doesn't necessarily provide for three square meals a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help struggling families and individuals, our nation is blessed to have many faith-based and other nonprofit service organizations that work to fight hunger. Over the last year, I have toured a number of these organizations in my home State--such as MANNA FoodBank in Asheville, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina in Charlotte, and Meals on Wheels of Senior Services in Winston-Salem. I also have visited the DC Central Kitchen here in Washington--just a few blocks from the Capitol. At each  of these organizations, I am inspired by the dedicated staff and volunteers who have such a passion for helping others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another hunger relief organization that I hold in the highest regard is the Society of St. Andrew, which gleans produce from farms and then packages, processes and transports excess food to feed hungry people across the country. When I think of gleaning, I often think of Ruth in the Old Testament. Her story takes place during a famine in Bethlehem, and Ruth gleaned so that her family could eat. In Biblical times, farmers were encouraged to leave crops in their fields for the poor and for travelers.  It is a practice we should be utilizing much more extensively today--considering that in this country, 27 percent of all the food produced annually is lost at the retail, consumer, and food service levels. This means we are wasting about 3,044 pounds of good food every second.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Society of St. Andrew recently passed a milestone--saving and distributing a total of 500 million pounds of food since 1983. This translates into  more than 1.5 billion servings. Already this year, the organization has provided more than 5.5 million pounds of produce. Amazingly, it only costs about 2 cents a serving to glean and deliver this food to those in need. And all of this work is done by the hands of tens of thousands of volunteers and a very  small staff. I have gleaned in North Carolina fields with my friends at the Society of St. Andrew, and they are truly a remarkable group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like any humanitarian endeavor, the gleaning system works because of cooperative efforts. Private organizations and individuals are doing a great job--but with very limited resources. One of the single largest concerns for gleaners is transportation--how to actually get food to those in need. To help address this problem, I am proud to reintroduce today the Hunger Relief Trucking Tax Credit Act, which would change the Tax Code to give transportation companies tax incentives for volunteering trucks  to transfer gleaned food. Specifically, my bill would create a 25-cent tax credit for each mile that food is transported for hunger relief efforts by a donated truck and driver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would provide a little extra encouragement for trucking companies to donate space in their vehicles to help more food reach more hungry people. I am grateful to my colleagues, Senators LINCOLN, BURR, DURBIN, VITTER and ALLARD, for joining this effort, and I welcome the support of relief organizations like the Society of St. Andrew, the American Trucking Association, and America's Second Harvest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Senators LAUTENBERG, LINCOLN, and I plan to soon reintroduce the Food Employment Empowerment and Development Program Act, or the FEED Act. The idea behind this legislation is simple: combine food rescue with job training, thus teaching unemployed and homeless adults the skills needed to work in the food service industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With support from the FEED Act, community kitchens will receive much-needed resources to help collect rescued food and provide 2 million meals each year to the hungry. Successful FEED Act-type programs already exist. For example, in Charlotte, NC, the Community Culinary School recruits students from social service agencies, homeless shelters, halfway houses and work release programs. And just around the comer from here, 25 students recently began training in the DC Central Kitchen's 68th culinary  job training class. This is a model program, which began in 1990, and it is always a great privilege to visit the kitchen and meet with the individuals who have faced adversity but are now on track for a career in the food service industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also must do more to help America's 12 million hungry children get on the right track. As a result of hunger, these children have higher levels of chronic illness, depression, and behavior problems. This is a travesty that can and must be prevented, and school feeding programs provide a critical means to this end. The National School Lunch Program feeds 30 million children in more than 100,000 schools each day. While reduced price meals are available to students whose family income is below  130 percent of the poverty level, State and local school board members have informed me that many families struggle to even pay this fee. In too many cases, this is creating an insurmountable barrier to participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am a strong supporter of eliminating the reduced price fee for these families and harmonizing the free income guideline with the WIC income guideline, which is 185 percent of poverty. In 2004, we succeeded in having a five-State pilot program authorized, and since then, a number of colleagues have joined me in urging funding for the program. I am very proud that the fiscal year 2008 Senate budget resolution finally includes the funds, and I will continue to push this during the  appropriations process--because expanding the free lunch program has great potential to alleviate hunger for millions of children and help them succeed in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>School feeding programs also offer tremendous opportunity to reach some of the 400 million chronically hungry children across the globe. Earlier this year, Senator DICK DURBIN and I introduced a bill to reauthorize the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. This program was named for my husband Senator Bob Dole and his good friend Senator George McGovern--both of whom remain tremendous advocates for this and other child nutrition initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with the U.S. school lunch program, the McGovern-Dole program helps attract children to schools. The nutritious meals provided help keep them alert and focused so they can learn and nourished so they can grow and mature. First authorized in 2002, the program provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products and financial and technical assistance for school food programs and maternal and child nutrition projects in low-income countries that are committed to universal education. In 2005 alone,  the McGovern-Dole program distributed 120,000 metric tons of U.S. food commodities, including wheat, wheat flour, corn, rice, dry beans, and vegetable oils, to schools that run feeding programs in the world's poorest countries. In addition to Federal funding, outside donors have provided approximately $1 billion to complement the McGovern-Dole program, making this initiative a successful public-private partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>McGovern-Dole has a proven track record of reducing hunger among school-age children and improving literacy and primary education enrollment in areas where conflict, hunger, poverty and HIV/AIDS are prevalent. School meals, teacher training, and related support have helped boost school enrollment and academic performance. These positive results are especially true among girls, including those who live where girls are commonly mistreated and marginalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my career in public service, I have seen the faces of hunger so many times. During my time at the American Red Cross, I witnessed hunger and starvation in war-torn Rwanda and famine-stricken Somalia. In Baidoa, I came upon a little boy lying under a sack. I thought he was dead, but as his brother sat him up, I could see that he was severely malnourished. I asked for camel's milk to feed him, and as I raised the cup to his mouth, I put my arm around his back. The feeling of the little  bones almost piercing through his flesh is something I will never forget. That is when the horror of starvation becomes real--when you can touch it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Deuteronomy 15:7, the Bible tells us, "If there is among you a poor man, one of your brethren, in any of your towns within your land which the Lord your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I implore friends on both sides of the aisle--and the people of this great country--to join in this mission, this grassroots network of compassion that transcends political ideology and provides hope and security not only for those in need today but for future generations. Let us stand and fight as one in this mission to end hunger.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="Introducing S. 1542. A bill to establish State infrastructure banks for education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1542">S. 1542</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act of 2007, an act that is critical in bringing our Nation's schools into the 21st century. If passed, this legislation would provide States with an economical way to fund school construction. Please allow me to express my thanks to my friend, Senator Harkin, for joining my efforts in the Senate, as well as to Representative Tauscher for his leadership in the House and his introduction  of the companion bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Society of Civil Engineers gave our Nation's school buildings a D in their last report card, with 75 percent of facilities deemed inadequate for education. Yet our children attend these schools every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When students attend rundown schools, their well-being and ability to learn is threatened. In 2004, in Washingtonville, NY, the roof over a classroom, in the 44-year-old Taft Elementary, collapsed. Had the collapse occurred just 32 days later, 15 children and 2 teachers could have been seriously injured or even killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past January, New York's Manhasset School District issued a report describing the condition of its  only high school. The 72-year-old building has exceeded its life expectancy, with a roof "beyond the stages of patching and repairing" and in need of replacement. Last school year, part of the ceiling collapsed in one of the stairwells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Buildings like this one, in use beyond their life expectancy, are dangerous and don't meet the demands of the 21st century. The lack of adequate school buildings hampers today's most promising and innovative efforts to boost student achievement. Many older school buildings are in a dangerous state of disrepair and have seriously outdated facilities. Many do not even have the proper wiring for computer networks. While we work to give students the academic tools they need to compete in the 21st  century, we must also upgrade school facilities to give students a learning environment conducive to success. This is why we included a new provision in this legislation creating healthy high-performance schools guidelines to direct schools during renovation and construction in order to create schools that will foster the development of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the National Education Association, repairs and modernization nationwide will cost $322 billion. Last year, over $20 billion was spent nationwide on school construction. At that rate, it will take more than 16 years to modernize school buildings, when today's kindergartners could be graduating from college. Clearly, school construction is costly, but a price cannot be put on the value of our children's education and well-being. We must use innovative methods in providing funding  for schools to make these essential renovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am introducing this bill. At the center of this bill is the creation of State infrastructure banks, which would improve financing for school construction. This financing mechanism was pioneered by the Reagan administration, which used it to help local communities fund water treatment and clean water facilities. The Clinton administration also used State infrastructure banks to help States finance transportation projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State infrastructure banks have been successful in financing public projects at a low cost to taxpayers. They would offer school districts flexible options of loan and credit enhancement assistance, such as low-interest loans, bond-financing security, loan guarantees, and credit support for financing projects, which result in lower interest rates. State infrastructure banks would not strain the Federal Treasury or the American taxpayer. After initial funding, they would require no ongoing Federal  appropriations. As loans are repaid, funds would be replenished, and banks could make new loans available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this bill would help provide immediate aid to the neediest schools and help local communities fund affordable construction far into the future. This modest proposal is one step in the school construction solution. We must continue to move forward in this Congress by creating an academic setting that will prepare our students for the 21st century workplace. I ask my colleagues to join me and Senator Harkin in supporting this critical piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1544">S. 1544</bill>] Mr. President, the United States spends more on health care as a percentage of GDP than any other industrialized country and costs continue to rise. However, there is significant variation in the quality of health care consumers receive. Are we getting a good deal? The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act, which I have introduced today with Senator Clinton, seeks to improve U.S. health care by providing qualified private-sector organizations access to Medicare data for the development  and release of reports on the quality, cost, efficiency and effectiveness of our health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumer groups, employers, insurance companies, labor unions and others have repeatedly requested access to Medicare data to improve the quality of the health care provided to their members, employees and beneficiaries and to help control the ever-rising costs of health care. While there remains legal debate over whether this data can be released, the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act ensures that the data collected by Medicare and paid for by the taxpayer can be utilized by qualified organizations  to measure quality and control costs while protecting beneficiary privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act of 2007: requires CMS to provide Medicare enrollment, claims, survey and assessment data to private sector Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations, MQROs, to develop reports to measure health care quality for the public; mandates the protection of beneficiary privacy; empowers consumer groups, providers, employers, insurance plans, labor unions and others to request reports from MQROs; and provides for the public release of all reports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Attempts are already being made by employers and insurance companies to measure quality. However, with limited amounts of privately held data, their analysis is not broad enough to provide the most accurate results. However, MQROs will have access to Medicare data and be authorized to aggregate both private and public data, providing a significantly more robust assessment of both quality and efficiency while requiring the complete protection of beneficiary health information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for America's health care system to improve, we need to know more and understand the quality of the care we are purchasing. The time has come for the health care community to compete on quality, value and cost, and not be rewarded simply for volume of care provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medicare Quality Enhancement Act ensures that the public will finally have the tools necessary to make informed health care decisions for themselves and their families.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="1552">S. 1552</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will authorize the Administrator of General Services to convey a parcel of real property to the Alaska Railroad Corporation. This parcel of land is used by GSA for a fleet management center at 2nd and Christensen avenue in downtown Anchorage. The site is approximately 78,000 sq. feet and is surrounded on two sides by Alaska Railroad property. This property was owned by the Alaska Railroad during the period of Federal ownership and  was leased to the General Services administration. At the time the railroad was transferred from Federal to State ownership, the parcel of land where the fleet center is located was successfully obtained by GSA for its motor pool function due to its close proximity to downtown Anchorage and other Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This parcel of land is a key transportation component for the redevelopment of Ship Creek. Allowing the Alaska Railroad to get the property back, either through a land exchange or fair market purchase, will allow the Railroad to make additional improvements in the area. GSA has indicated a desire  to move from its present location to a location closer to the military bases in Anchorage as most of their business has become the management of a motor pool  for the bases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As consideration for the property, the administrator shall require the AKRR Corporation to either convey a replacement facility to GSA or pay the fair market value of the property based on the highest and best use as determined by an independent appraisal commissioned by the administrator and paid for by the Alaska Railroad Corporation. All proceeds derived from any payment for the property shall be deposited in the Federal buildings fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GSA supports this legislation to expedite their move from the present location to one that will allow them to better serve the military bases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
