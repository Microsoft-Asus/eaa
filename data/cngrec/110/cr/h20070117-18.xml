  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the past 4 years big oil companies have seen their profits quadruple, while gas prices doubled and America continues to depend on foreign oil to operate our cars and our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, the Republican Congress did not think this was enough. They chose to give Big Oil billions in tax breaks and outrageous royalty incentives, instead of working to protect consumers and promote alternative energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we are sending $800 million per day to the Middle East and other oil producing countries. America now has record high dependence on foreign oil, and the need is growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress must support consumers instead of Big Oil. Democrats have put forth a bill to increase our investment in renewable energy and put our Nation on a path to energy independence. The first step is to repeal the billions of dollars in subsidies given to Big Oil so that America can instead invest that money in clean and renewable energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning the process of curbing our addiction to foreign oil is one of the main priorities of the Democratic Congress during the first 100 hours. I hope Democrats and Republicans will come together and pass this commonsense legislation that will promote our national and economic security.</paragraph>
