    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to call attention to the loss of one of the foremost members of the racing community. Benny Parsons passed away on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Benny was a wonderful friend, not only to the industry, but to mankind. Benny lived a wonderful life. He set many records. He was the first person to drive a stockcar over 200 miles an hour, and won many, many championships. A native and resident of North Carolina, he will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this body extends our sympathy and gratitude to the Parsons family and his wife, Terri, for the many, many services Benny has provided.</paragraph>
