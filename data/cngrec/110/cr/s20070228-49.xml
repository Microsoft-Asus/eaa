    <paragraph>Mr. President, I made a plea earlier today for Members to come to the floor and offer amendments so we can complete action on this important legislation in timely fashion. I would further editorialize, we are going to finish the bill, and I hope it is not necessary to file cloture. The Republican leader and I do not want to have to file cloture on this bill. We want people to come forward and offer amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we resume consideration of the bill tomorrow, we will have a Democratic amendment ready to offer at that time.</paragraph>
