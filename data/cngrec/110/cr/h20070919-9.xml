  <narrative>THE NEED TO INSURE MORE OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10514]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the news about health care in our Nation continues to get more discouraging, especially when it comes to health insurance for children. New Census data shows that the number of children without health insurance in the United States has grown over the last year by 700,000, to nearly 8.7 million children. This means that now one in nine American kids do not have health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To try and reverse these unacceptable trends, the Democratic Congress voted last month to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. Our legislation will provide an additional 5 million low-income children with the health insurance they need to live healthier lives. These kids are already eligible but not enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush has threatened to veto this legislation, despite bipartisan support it received in Congress and from our Governors. In the face of these discouraging new Census numbers, it is time for the President to end his veto threat and pledge his support for this legislation that will provide 11 million children with the health care coverage they need and deserve.</paragraph>
