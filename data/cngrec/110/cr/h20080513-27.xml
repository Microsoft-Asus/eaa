FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Congress finds as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Alice Paul was born on January, 11, 1885, in Moorestown New Jersey, and died on July 9, 1977.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Alice Paul dedicated her life to securing suffrage and equal rights for all women and, as founder of the National Woman's Party, she was instrumental in the passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party were the first group ever to picket the White House.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) While President Woodrow Wilson trumpeted America's values of democracy abroad during World War I, Alice Paul was dedicated to reminding the President that not all Americans enjoyed democracy at home.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Alice Paul used nonviolent civil disobedience to bring national attention to the women's suffrage movement, such as the 3-week hunger strike she undertook when she was sentenced to jail in October, 1917, for her demonstrations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Alice Paul's courage inspired thousands of women to join the women's suffrage movement. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Instead of patiently waiting for States to grant women suffrage, Alice Paul mobilized an entire generation of women to pressure the United States Congress and the President to give all women in America the right to vote.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Alice Paul did not stop her fight after the 19th Amendment was ratified; she drafted the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1923 and fought tirelessly for its passage until her death 54 years later.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Alice Paul lobbied Congress to include gender in civil rights bills and was successful in including sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) Alice Paul sought equal rights for women all over the world, not just Americans and, as a means of pursuing this goal, founded the World Party for Equal Rights for Women in the 1930's.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) Alice Paul was instrumental in the placement of a passage on gender equality in the preamble of the United Nations Charter.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) Few people have played a greater role in shaping the history of the United States than Alice Paul.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) Alice Paul is an example to all Americans of what one person can do to make a difference for millions of people.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous materials thereon.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to thank Chairman Frank; Ranking Member Spencer Bachus, the minority member; and I'd also like to thank Representative Judy Biggert, who is also a cosponsor of the legislation and who is managing this on the floor this morning. I also want to take time to thank all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is bipartisan legislation that has 406 cosponsors out of the 435 Members. The title of the bill is <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>, and there are 406 cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank my staff for their hard work and dedication to the passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>, the Alice Paul Women's Suffrage Congressional Gold Medal Act, a bill to honor Alice Paul, a woman who dedicated her life to equality. This legislation is supported by the National Council of Women's Organizations, the Alice Paul Institute, the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum, the League of Women Voters, MANA, the 4-E-R-A, and the National Organization of Women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation awards Alice Paul and the movement she spearheaded the Congressional Gold Medal, to recognize her role in the women's suffrage movement and in advancing equal rights, and I state equal rights, for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people do not know about Alice Paul, but today they will. It is my hope that this legislation will ratify that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of Alice Paul and the work of other suffragists, we have the 19th amendment to the United States Constitution that guarantees that women have the right to vote. Women have the right to be Members of Congress, State officials, and to participate in local policies and the ability to run for public office. That's why here in Congress, we currently have 87 women in Congress. Because of Alice Paul, Speaker Pelosi can be the Democratic leader right here in the 110th Congress. Because  of Alice Paul, Senator Clinton can run for the highest office in the Nation and maybe be the President of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul was a remarkable person who made America more democratic by fighting for equal rights and creating opportunities for women. She advocated for women in our country as well as in the Americas, within the confines of the United Nations. Alice Paul helped draft the equal rights amendment in 1923. In 1923. Alice Paul lobbied to ensure that sex discrimination was included in title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to stress the blood, sweat, and tears that went hand in hand with the women's suffrage movement. Alice Paul truly gave of herself. She motivated, she empowered women to fight, to have courage, and to challenge the status quo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul's leadership was unyielding, tenacious, and never self-serving. She suffered imprisonment, solitary confinement, and force feeding when officials tried sabotage her hunger strike. She dedicated her life for women's rights. A true American. A true champion. An American worthy of our gratitude and never-ending respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her work must be honored and preserved by congressional acknowledgment. The Congressional Gold Medal is only a small token in comparison to the legacy that Alice Paul gave us all. Alice Paul's contribution to America cannot be understated. For this reason I urge all Members to support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>, the Alice Paul Women's Suffrage Congressional Gold Medal Act. This legislation will recognize Alice Paul's role in the women's suffrage movement with the award of the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest civilian honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a great honor to be speaking on this bill authored by my friend and colleague from California, Congressman Baca. I commend the gentleman for his work on this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill celebrates the 72-year struggle towards women's suffrage and the woman who devoted her life to that movement, Alice Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>To many, Alice Paul symbolizes the very spirit of determination and resilience of the suffrage movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was born in 1885 to Quaker parents. Alice Paul's childhood was somewhat of an anomaly for the time, because she was raised with the belief of gender equality. In this way, her childhood reflected the vision of the larger society she would work to forge until her death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A graduate of Swarthmore College, a recipient of a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, and a believer in working towards the betterment of society, Alice Paul became an ardent proponent of women's suffrage in 1907 while in London.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon her return to the United States in 1910, Ms. Paul brought the determination of the English movement to bear on the American campaign. She  joined the National American Women's Suffrage Association and was quickly charged with heading the drive for a Federal suffrage amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing that boldness was needed to accomplish her task, Alice Paul organized a parade comprised of woman to coincide with the inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson. The participating women were attacked with both insults and physical violence. However, the news made headlines and suffrage became a popular topic throughout the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of differences on tactics, Alice Paul left Women Suffrage Association and formed the National Woman's Party. Paul and her newly formed party were more aggressively than ever, picketing a war-time President and staging hunger strikes. Such methods were met with vehement opposition from authorities who arrested Paul and members of her group, subjecting them to horrific prison conditions and even attempted to have Paul declared insane. Yet nothing deterred her. Paul continued the march towards  enfranchisement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The suffragist's imprisonment and abuse caused a public outcry so strong that President Wilson reversed his position on a suffrage amendment, supporting it as a necessary "war-time" measure. It passed the House and Senate in 1919, and was ratified by the necessary three-fourths of States in 1920. In August of 1920 American women gained the right to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, Alice Paul's advocacy did not end with that triumph. In 1923, Alice Paul began her work on the Equal Rights Amendment, the ERA. The amendment was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until its passage in 1972. To date, the amendment has never been become part of the U.S. Constitution. It has been ratified by 35 of the necessary 38 States needed to ratify the Constitution. Alice Paul fought for its passage each time. And we continue to fight for it to become an amendment  to the U.S. Constitution in honor of Alice Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, two prominent institutions work to memorialize Paul's life and the progress of the women's movement: The Alice Paul Institute and the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum in Washington. This Congressional Gold Medal will be displayed in an alternating fashion at these two establishments, further honoring Ms. Paul and her legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic movement and this historic woman gave this Nation so much. <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill> acknowledges this fact, commemorating Alice Paul. I urge its immediate passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield such time as she might consume to the gentlewoman from California, my good friend, Grace Napolitano.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400290" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend and colleague, Joe Baca, from California for authoring this important legislation and thank Judy Biggert for supporting <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>, the Alice Paul Congressional Gold Medal Act that would honor a true pioneer, one of the original suffragettes, as the progress of women's rights and equality continues to be such a strong need in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 20th century, she followed Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She recognized the disenfranchisement of women from political and public sectors and made it her passion to reconcile these injustices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Stokes Paul was a Quaker from Mount Laurel, New Jersey. She went to Swarthmore College and got her B.A. in 1905, which was unheard of in that time period. As was said before, she went to the New York School of Philanthropy, the University of Pennsylvania where she got her M.A. in Sociology, the University of Birmingham, the London School of Economics in 1907, and then the University of Pennsylvania where she got a Ph.D. in political science. Her dissertation at the time was the legal position  of women in Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then in 1927, she received an LL.M. followed by a doctor of civil law degree in 1928 from the American University's Washington College of Law. As was mentioned, she joined the National American Women Suffrage Association in 1912, had done remarkable work with Lucy Burns, formed the Congressional Union, as was also mentioned. She actually laid the groundwork for the continuing of women to be able to have parity and equal rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She employed nonviolent civil disobedience campaigns, the hunger strike for which she was put into a prison psychiatric ward and force fed. She made it her passion to be able to continue fighting for the rights of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She energized a movement that produced a formal voice for women in politics through the voting rights. My female colleagues here in Washington and in Congress would not be standing before you today had it not been for those sacrifices made by Alice Paul and the suffragists. Her tireless efforts help provide women with the legal right to vote. That movement also fueled the social and cultural progress that has allowed me and others like me to participate at an elevated level of political progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She deserves a Congressional Medal of Honor, Mr. Speaker, because her actions have not only given women a voice in our country but provided inspiration for all disenfranchised women's groups to break that proverbial glass ceiling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my House colleagues, Joe Baca and Judy Biggert, that moved this bill forward. I urge the Senate to follow the House lead and support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Minnesota who is also a member of the Financial Services Committee, Mrs. Bachmann.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Baca of California for sponsoring this legislation that is very important. Thank you for being so persistent in seeking 406 cosponsors of your legislation. And I also thank Mrs. Biggert, as well, for her timely remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise with regard to <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill> honoring the early suffragist Alice Paul who worked hard to provide better treatment for American women in our legal and in our political system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the congressional chairman of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Washington, D.C., Alice Paul performed a critical role in persuading Congress to pass the 19th amendment which guaranteed American women the right to vote. She later stated that her work in passing this amendment was "the greatest thing I have I ever did."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul is rightly venerated by American feminists. But few recall her work to also expose the effects of legalized abortion as "the ultimate exploitation of women."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, toward the end of her great career, Alice Paul grew frustrated with America's women's rights movement as it drifted away from its original mission of advocating for a better life for American women and in favor of legislation for abortion. Alice Paul was highly critical of this shift, and she harbored grave reservations about abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage you and my colleagues to join me in honoring this courageous women's career in its entirety. May this deliberative body take to heart her views on women's rights and its incompatibility with legalized abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank both Mr. Baca and Mrs. Biggert for sponsoring this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First of all, I would like to thank the gentlewoman Mrs. Bachmann and, of course, Congresswoman Grace Napolitano for their compassionate speech about <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>. A true hero, a woman who will leave a legacy not only for our country, for our Nation, but for our children and others, and especially I say for my daughters, I have two daughters, to know that they now have the right to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I was inspired by a movie that I saw entitled Iron Jawed Angels. That is how I happened to find out about Alice Paul and her history and contributions. I think too much time has passed and she should have been recognized some time ago. Were it not for she had done, many of us would not be in office right now because it also impacted many of us minorities. Not only did women gain the right to vote, but many minorities now have the ability  to vote  under the 19th amendment because of women's suffrage. So I congratulate her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote "aye" for <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong to support of <bill type="h" number="406">H.R. 406</bill>, which awards a Congressional Gold Medal to Alice Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every American woman is indebted to Alice Paul for her lifelong dedication to women's suffrage. I am living proof of the advancements she has made for women. I am personally gratified that Congress is recognizing Alice Paul's contribution to American history. Alice Paul was the first cousin to my husband's grandmother. In fact, I named my oldest daughter after her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul passionately devoted her entire life to the advancement of women's rights. She was an extraordinary leader, ingenious fundraiser, and a brilliant politician. Wholeheartedly focused on suffrage, she lived in a cold room so she would not be tempted to sit up late and read novels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul truly revolutionized the suffragist movement. In 1913, Alice Paul and fellow suffragist Lucy Burns organized an impressive suffrage parade on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. In 1916, Paul founded the National Women's Party with the guiding philosophy of "holding the party in power responsible." Paul adamantly believed that women should never expect to be given the vote, but that they must take it through their own accord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Paul's leadership, the National Women's Party was the first political organization in the United States to peacefully picket the White House. This political strategy is still widely used today. Originally the White House protests were tolerated by President Wilson. But as the women persistently picketed during the war, suffragist protestors were attacked by angry mobs and frequently arrested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The suffragist prisoners demanded to be treated as political prisoners and staged hunger strikes. Their demands were met with brutality as suffragists, including older women, were beaten, pushed and thrown into cold, unsanitary, rat-infested cells. Women were even force-fed against their will. Thanks to the countless sacrifices made by suffrage activists, American women were finally granted the right to vote in 1920.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, Alice Paul firmly believed that true fulfillment of women's rights was only advanced, not completely satisfied, by the achievement of suffrage. Paul drafted the Equal Rights Amendment for the United States Constitution in 1923. She devoted the rest of her life to this goal of constitutional protection for women's equality and today, feminists continue this pursuit. I have proudly continued her legacy by introducing the ERA every Congress since 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice Paul's lifelong efforts achieved great strides not only for American women, but for all women of the world. She founded the World Woman's Party in 1938. Paul and the World Woman's Party successfully fought for the inclusion of gender equality into the United Nations Charter. Their efforts also led to the establishment of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. This Commission continues to be a principal global policy-making body for women's advancement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us finally grant Alice Paul her rightful place in history. She is most deserving of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Her legacy opened the door for women's full participation in society and for that, we are forever grateful.</paragraph>
