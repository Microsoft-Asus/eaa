    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Cuban patriot--Mario Chanes de Armas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we speak of individuals who have spent their lives fighting for the fundamental right of people to live in freedom, we often think of individuals like Nelson Mandela and Natan Sharansky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, today I want to share with you the story of Mario Chanez de Armas. He spent 30 years as a prisoner of conscience in Castro's gulag. He was the longest serving political prisoner the world has known--30 years imprisoned for his political views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Mr. Chanes died last week at the age of 80 before his one true dream could be fulfilled--freedom for the people of Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my condolences to the members of his family and his many friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man of great conviction and held a true love for humanity. Mario Chanes was a freedom fighter in the truest sense of the words. Originally a labor leader, Chanes de Armas demonstrated leadership and charisma and was an early ally of the then perceived "reformer" Fidel Castro. They had worked together for democracy and against the Batista dictatorship. He and Castro shared a cell in Batista's prison until they were both released.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after the Castro take over Mario began to see the true nature of the individual that was his former cell mate. He realized that Castro did not care about civil liberties and human rights or democracy as he once claimed but rather Castro became what he remains today--irrational, a devoted communist, and an enemy of freedom, a brutal dictator. For pointing out the danger Castro posed to Cubans, Chanes de Armas was jailed as a counter-revolutionary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served for 30 years in deplorable conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Human Rights Watch reports that Cuban political prisoners spend months in isolation cells, sometimes without light or ventilation. They are often provided no beds--no mattresses. Their rations of food and water are barely enough to sustain life. Sanitation and medical conditions are so bad that inmates often leave prison with serious ailments--if they are allowed to leave at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chanes de Armas suffered these conditions. For his continued resistance against the dictatorship, he was put in tapiadas, steel isolation cells, and gavetas, "drawers" so narrow that he only had room to stand. And for what? For refusing to change his political beliefs and for rejecting communism. They never broke his spirit in spite of all the punishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Today I want us to take a moment to remember Mario Chanes de Armas--to honor him, his legacy, our continued battle for freedom and the ideals in which he believed and tried so hard to bring to Cuba--liberty, democracy, human rights, rules of law. His dream lives on and his legacy lights the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
