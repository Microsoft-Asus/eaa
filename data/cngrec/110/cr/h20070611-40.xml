  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this evening as a proud resident of Waterloo, Iowa. Recently, Forbes named the Waterloo-Cedar Falls metro area as the "13th best place for business and careers" among small metro areas in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing unlucky about this number 13. I have lived in Waterloo for almost 25 years, and I can tell you from experience that the people of the Cedar Valley have made all of the difference there. The last decade has brought a renewed commitment to civic improvement, and these investments have paid off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investments in things like good schools, an expanding workforce and an  improved infrastructure have clearly played a big part of this recognition. Businesses are attracted to the skilled, smart and hardworking workforce of the Cedar Valley, ranked number 49 because of educational attainment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to me that more and more people are catching on to what the Cedar Valley has to offer. I congratulate my neighbors in Waterloo and Cedar Falls.</paragraph>
