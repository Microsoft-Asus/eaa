    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the failure of Congress to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act results in a broken promise to over 600 forested counties across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Surely you remember the frantic search last month for James Kim and his family in the Federal forests of southern Oregon. Josephine County relied on critical emergency resources in this heart-breaking effort. Ninety percent of the county's search and rescue budget has been funded by this Federal program, which this Congress has not reauthorized. Likewise, the county utilizes an emergency phone notification system to alert homeowners to disasters and emergencies. They used it during the search  for the Kim family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-five percent of Josephine County's land base is Federal. When disaster strikes, quick information response is literally a matter of life and death. Failure to reauthorize this program means these county services may not be funded and may not be available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Josephine County Commissioner Dave Toler said, the loss of this program "is about more than numbers. Its loss will change our lives for many more years to come."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, it is high time for Congress to reauthorize this legislation.</paragraph>
