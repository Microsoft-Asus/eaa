  <narrative>FARM BILL VETO OVERRIDE -- (Senate - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4585">S4585</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes speaking about the farm bill. We will be considering an override of the President's veto hopefully later on this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand, a few hours ago, the President went ahead and vetoed this bill which we worked on so hard in this Chamber for the last 2 1/2  years, under the great leadership of Senator Harkin, Senator Chambliss, Senator Baucus, and Senator Grassley, along with Senator Conrad and so many of my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee as well as the Senate Finance Committee. Hopefully, we can override the President's veto quickly because what is at  stake is the security of America in so many different ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From what my colleagues tell me, this is the best farm bill we have written in the Congress in the last several decades. For me, there are significant portions of this bill which open whole new opportunities for America, and I wish to spend a few minutes talking about what I think some of those opportunities are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost, we need to remind the Nation this is a bill about feeding the hungry. It is a bill about nutrition. Nearly 70 percent of the money under this legislation will go to feed the most vulnerable people in America, including providing healthy food--fruits and vegetables--for the young people of America. For my State alone, what this will mean--I come from a small State of some 5 million people--is that about $45 million a year in fruits and vegetables will go to help our young kids  who are in school so they can learn healthy eating habits and so they can be in an environment where they can truly learn. So nutrition is a very big part of this legislation. It is why hunger advocates, the faith community, schools, and so many others have been beating the drum so loudly for us to get this bill completed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second is rural development. Rural development is a huge issue for much of this country. Today across America there are some 1,700 counties, and more than half the counties of America are designated as rural. About 800 of those counties lost population in the last few years. It is part of the America that is withering on the vine. Many of the provisions of this farm bill, including rural development sections of this farm bill, will help this part of America, which seems to be left out, to be  put into a position of being second class. This farm bill invests heavily in rural America through the rural development programs that are included in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third is conservation. Through the leadership of Senator Harkin and his vision for what we do with conservation, the $3 billion-plus that is added for conservation in this farm bill will help us make sure the conservation ethic we have pursued in this country is something we can preserve for a long time to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, title IX of this farm bill is the energy title. In that title of the farm bill, we continue a policy which has been a bipartisan policy of this Congress to try to get rid of our dependence on foreign oil and to try to harness the power of the wind, the power of cellulosic ethanol, the power of hydroelectricity, the power of geothermal, and so many other renewable energy resources. Rural America stands ready to grasp the reins of responsibility and opportunity to help us achieve energy  independence in a real way. So the energy section of this bill is a very important part of it, and so many people have been a part of this and have worked on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would say this is work which has involved the administration now for 2 1/2  years. It baffles me that this President would turn his back on the people of America by vetoing this  farm bill, knowing his administration has been helping us craft this bill. The excuse I have heard, which has been out there in public, is this farm bill raises taxes. This farm bill doesn't raise any taxes at all. Unlike the fiscal recklessness we have seen over the  last 7 years with this administration, what we have done is we have paid for this bill. This bill is 100 percent paid for, and it is paid for without a tax increase. It is paid for with the reforms we have included in this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am hopeful when this legislation does get over here to the floor for the consideration of the override of the President's veto, we will have a near acclamation of a vote against the President's veto of the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
