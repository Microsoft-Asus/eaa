  <speaking speaker="400063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the third anniversary of the congressional declaration of genocide in Darfur. It's not a happy occasion; it's a sad one. And I hope we don't have to do this again next year or any time after that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the American people, the American taxpayers and the American activists in this country who have kept the pressure on us, on the administration, on the United Nations and on the world to try to stop this genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been to Darfur, and I will tell you that as an American taxpayer you can't be more proud than when you look out, and unfortunately these poor people have been chased out of their homes, and families killed and massacred, but at least when you look out, all of their shelters are covered with U.S. flags. Now, it's because we have to send all the aid to feed and take care of them. But those shelters are made out of the bags that carry the wheat and the rice that feeds them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are doing our job. The administration is doing something, but not enough. The U.N. is doing way too little. And I hope that next year we won't have to come back and do this.</paragraph>
