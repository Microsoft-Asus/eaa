    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great honor that I would like to recognize remarkable contributions of 91-year-old Frances Landers of El Dorado, AR. At a time when most people consider retirement, Frances dedicated the past 30 years of her life to making education accessible to the children of Haiti. Through her selfless years of service, Frances' work and formation of the Haiti Education Foundation have opened educational doors of opportunity for hundreds of children who otherwise might  never have learned to read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frances visited Haiti this past April to say her goodbyes, for this was most likely her last visit. She first came to Haiti in 1977 as a medical volunteer with her late husband Dr. Gardner Landers, an ophthalmologist, to help people with cataract problems. Dr. and Mrs. Landers began making two trips a year, providing surgery and eyeglasses to the Haitian people. During these visits, she met Father Jean-Wilfrid Albert, a chaplain of the mission hospital. Through Father Albert and her numerous  mission trips, Frances discovered that many villages had no school and most citizens were illiterate. Impassioned to make a difference, Frances returned to Arkansas and began raising money. Through her dedication, perseverance and conviction, she soon launched one school, and over time, many others followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of her establishment of the Haiti Education Foundation, there are now 40 primary schools and 10 secondary schools, which are currently educating more than 11,000 Haitian children. Through donations and scholarships, the foundation provides schooling, hot lunches, shoes, school uniforms, textbooks, Creole bibles, milk, and goats for families. These schools set the foundation for students to enroll in universities and pursue careers that allow them to break past poverty barriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Landers continues to raise awareness and funding to ensure the foundation's success. She has lived in service to the people of Haiti and is an extraordinary example of what can be achieved when committed to a worthwhile endeavor. Today, I honor and thank Frances Landers for her continual interest in others and inspiring those around her to do the same.</paragraph>
