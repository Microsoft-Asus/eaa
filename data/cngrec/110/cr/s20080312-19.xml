  <narrative>NATIONAL EYE DONOR MONTH -- (Senate - March 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1994">S1994</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, March is National Eye Donor Month. In fact, it's the 25th anniversary of that proud tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each March since 1983, the eye donor community has gathered to celebrate the gift of sight, to honor past donors and their families, and to raise awareness about eye donation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank those who have given this amazing gift and to encourage more Americans to become eye donors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eye donation is an incredible thing. Precious corneas harvested from donated eyes can restore vision that's been lost to disease or injury or infection. Most of us take our vision for granted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We read our books, watch our children grow, and find our loved ones in a crowded room--and don't give it a second thought. But what if you lost that ability, that gift of sight--or never had it at all. An estimated 11.4 million people have severe visual problems that are not correctable by glasses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty million people suffer from potentially blinding eye disease; 1.1 million people are legally blind. But there is hope. Through the miracle of transplantation, it is possible to restore sight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, 44,000 sight-restoring corneal transplants are performed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eye banks like the Central Ohio Lions Eye Bank change people's lives. Shirley Jacobs knows this first hand. Shirley was living with Fuchs dystrophy, a genetic degenerative corneal disease. The disease robbed her of clear vision. It limited her independence and her ability to do her job. Then she received a corneal transplant at the Central Ohio Lions Eye Bank. Her first words after the surgery were, "This is a miracle! I can see you, I can see you!"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is amazing. But so many more people are waiting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Ohio alone, 1,600 people each year could have their sight restored through corneal transplants. But there aren't enough organs available. We need to get the word out and reach people who would donate if given the choice. We must raise public awareness of the need for eye donors and the ways to sign up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to work with their local eye banks and the Eye Bank Association of America to promote the precious gift of eye donation. I also encourage Americans to consider designating themselves as organ donors on their driver's licenses. It is the best way to make your end-of-life wishes known and to give the gift of sight. I urge my colleagues and fellow citizens to consider becoming an eye donor. Thousands of people around the country are waiting for it.</paragraph>
