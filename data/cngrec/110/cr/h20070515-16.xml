  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last year U.S. foreign oil imports climbed to a record level of 66 percent. American families are paying a record $3.09 a gallon on average for regular gasoline, more than double the cost of gasoline when President Bush took office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 6 years now, the President has failed to address these costs or our Nation's energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, under pressure to finally do something, President Bush announced an executive order to develop regulations to lower vehicle emissions before he leaves office in 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is too little, too late. The administration has had 6 years to act, and they have failed. They failed to address the energy concerns of our Nation while giving big tax breaks to the oil and gas industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, we have a new Democratic Congress that is going to lead our Nation towards energy independence. We are determined to find ways to be more energy efficient, to bring new, safer, less expensive, homegrown sources of energy to American families and American businesses, and we will start now by bringing a comprehensive energy bill to the House floor in July that will drive down costs and meet our Nation's future energy needs.</paragraph>
