    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this last weekend I was grateful to visit our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I saw firsthand the growing success in Baghdad during a visit with Major General Joseph Fil, commander of forces in Baghdad, to a neighborhood joint security site. We saw shops open, normal traffic, and civilians unafraid. This evidence of success was repeated in a visit to Ramadi, where enthusiastic American and Iraqi troops have deposed the al Qaeda terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Kabul, I was briefed on training of Afghan police by the 218th Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard led by General Bob Livingston. As a 28-year veteran of the 218th, I know the competence and resolve of our troops. Additionally, in Jalalabad, American and Afghani provincial reconstruction teams are promoting security, governance, and economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With eight visits to Iraq and four to Afghanistan, I am more convinced than ever that to protect the American families we must stop the terrorists overseas. Our dedicated troops deserve our support of this vital mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
