  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today with Congressmen JONES, PRICE, WATT, ETHERIDGE, MCINTYRE, MILLER and SHULER, all of North Carolina, to honor and observe the 70th birthday of our four-term Governor of North Carolina, the Honorable James B. Hunt, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years my long-time and dear friend, Governor Hunt, has successfully dedicated so much of himself to public service. He is a man of immense vision with an extraordinary ability to implement his vision with great results. That vision has often been focused on education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Hunt's list of accomplishments is long and highly distinguished in the area of education. He led efforts to establish the State's primary reading program. He also spearheaded the efforts to reduce class sizes and prevent students from dropping out of school. Governor Hunt assumed the lead role in establishing the State's school of science and mathematics, the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Smart Start, which was established under Governor Hunt's leadership, has become a nationally recognized and award-winning public-private partnership that ensures that children enter school healthy and ready to succeed. The program helps provide quality child care, health care and family support for every child in need, and there are now 14 States using this model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Hunt also assisted with establishing one of the most rigorous approaches to measuring student performance, requiring mastery before promotion and graduation, and providing assistance to turn around failing schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He did not allow these initiatives, or any of the many others he headed, to stand alone after he signed them into law. Instead, he demanded follow-through and results, and he got them. A study by the RAND Corporation found that our public schools raised their test scores more than any other State in the 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Governor Hunt's strong-held belief that the key to a quality education is great teaching has benefited students well beyond North Carolina's borders. In fact, it has benefited students and teachers throughout our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the founding Chair for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, Governor Hunt was a driving force in fulfilling the promise of improving student achievement by raising the standards. Today, virtually every State and more than 25 percent of all school districts offer financial rewards or incentives for teachers seeking certification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the economic value of an education and knowledge was well understood by Governor Hunt long before people started talking about its central role in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Governor Hunt has also led the way in opening up the Democratic Party of our State to full participation by minority citizens. As Governor, Governor Jim Hunt appointed many African American lawyers to the trial bench and appellate court benches to hold positions that had been virtually impossible for them to otherwise obtain. Many of them now serve as judges with distinction, and it was Governor Hunt who made that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, we are honored today to recognize this great man of conviction, principle, and exceptional character on such a joyous occasion. I ask you to join us in congratulating the "Education Governor," the Honorable James B. Hunt, Jr., on his 70th birthday, and in wishing him and his wife, Carolyn, many more years of happiness and accomplishment.</paragraph>
