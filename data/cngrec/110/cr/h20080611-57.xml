  <narrative>THE ENERGY CRISIS AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5302]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about the energy crisis in this country now for some time, and it has captured the imagination and the attention of probably every person in America, all 300 million people, because the price of gasoline is now over $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has affected every family as far as their ability to live the kind of life they want to because they have to spend so much money on energy. It has affected the price of our food because the people who transport our commodities across the country--the truckers--are now paying $4.50 to $5 a gallon for diesel fuel. In fact, they've demonstrated here at the United States Capitol with their trucks because it's so expensive for them to do their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a hearing today on how China is being involved in the United States and in Central and South America. They're buying up more and more of the oil because they have an economic expansion program, funded, in large part, by the money that we give to them in trade. India is now taking more and more energy and oil. So the demand around the world is growing at a very rapid rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are always talking about new energy--new sources of energy, new technologies. I'm for all of that. We all want to clean up the environment, but with the demand for oil growing at such a rapid rate all around the world and with these countries that have more and more ability to buy oil and to use oil because they need more because their populations are growing so rapidly, we need to do something about energy in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the ability from coal shale, I understand, to take care of this country for a couple of hundred years, as far as oil is concerned, by converting that shale into a usable energy oil shale. We have the ability to get 1 million to 2 million barrels of oil a day out of the ANWR in Alaska. We're not doing that. We have the ability to get 1 million or 2 million barrels a day off the Outer Continental Shelf. We're not doing that. We have up to a 500-year supply of natural gas in this country.  We're not drilling for that. It's all because of what people call environmental concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just like to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we should be concerned about the environment, but we should also be concerned about the economy of this country. We can't survive if the energy costs continue to go up and up and up while we wait on the transition to new technologies. Those new technologies are going to come, but it may take 1 year, 5 years, 10 years from now before they are able to pick up the major part of the energy needs of this country. We can't  wait that long. We simply can't. We could become a second-rate economic power if we don't get control of our energy needs and are able to get the energy that is necessary for this country to grow economically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just don't understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other chamber on the other side of the aisle continue to say we should not drill for oil in our own country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The American people, if you went out on the street and asked anybody at any service station, will tell you they don't care where we drill, because they want their gas prices down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we can drill in an environmentally safe way, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not allow us to do it. It is just unexplainable, as far as I am concerned. We have the resources in this country, we have the ability in this country, to provide for the oil resources that are necessary to lower the gas prices in this country, and we are not doing it. And we are not going to do it as long as the other side, the Democrats in this Congress, continue to block us, because of "environmental  concerns."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has to be a balance between the economic concerns in this country and the environment concerns, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are simply not realizing that. They have the "ostrich syndrome." They have got their heads in the sand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gasoline prices have gone up $1.50 in the last 2 years since this body has been taken over by the Democratic Party. This is intolerable. They said they were going to do something about the energy crisis in this country when it was $1.50 less per gallon. We have to do something about it, and we have to start now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked about energy independence during the Carter years back in the  seventies, and we haven't done anything about it. We had gas lines real long back in those days and we were going to become energy independent. We have not done it. The Congress of the United States has been controlled by the other party up until 1994, and we haven't done anything about the energy shortfalls in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time that we become really bipartisan in the search for energy. It is time for us to work together. We need to be able to explore this country for the natural resources we have, the oil that we have in the ground and the natural gas we have in the ground, and we are not doing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just like to end by saying this, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Let's work together. Let's explore and drill for the oil that we have in this country so we can truly move towards energy independence and at the same time move toward the new technologies that will give us more and more of a clean Earth. That is what we all want. But at the same time, we have got to have energy now. We have to drill for it now. And I hope my colleagues will realize this before  it is too late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is going to be a major issue in this campaign this fall, and I hope they will realize that and come to the conclusion that we ought to become truly energy independent and move in that direction.</paragraph>
