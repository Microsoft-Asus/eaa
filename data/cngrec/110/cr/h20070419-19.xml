  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush has an opportunity to  provide real hope to millions of Americans who are suffering from debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. All he has to do now is reconsider his threat to veto this promising legislation that has recently passed the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in the House we passed, in a bipartisan manner, during the first 100 hours of Congress, legislation that would increase the number of embryonic stem cells eligible for Federal funding. The Senate, in strong bipartisan passion, did exactly the same. Now it has arrived at the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year the President vetoed stem cell legislation, the only issue he vetoed throughout his Presidency. We have a real opportunity finally to solve some of these debilitating diseases. There are 100 million Americans waiting for the President to say "yes." I urge him to reconsider.</paragraph>
