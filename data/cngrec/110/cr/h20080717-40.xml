    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a special group of people, the millions of participants and volunteers of the Special Olympics. Next Sunday, the Special Olympics turns 40 years old, and we are extremely grateful for the opportunities they provide to the intellectually disabled members of our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of the Special Olympics is simple to express, but monumental to achieve: to empower individuals to become physically fit, productive and respected members of the community through sports training and competition. Not deterred by the challenge of their tasks, the organizers of the Special Olympics programs have performed phenomenally and made a serious impact in countless lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, their extraordinary results are likely due to their focus on the games, and not the winners. This is apparent from their oath, "Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me brave in the attempt," a message from which we can all learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to recognize and congratulate the Special Olympics on their 40th anniversary and to wish them continued success in their most worthy cause.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
