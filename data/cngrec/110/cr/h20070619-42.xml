    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have been engaging in discussion on the appropriations regarding the Energy and Water bill. Much of our attention has been on the gas prices, which is clearly a key element of need for the American people. I believe that when we finish this bill, we will have a strong and positive response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at the same time, water is a concern for the American people as well. Flooding is a concern for the American people as well. I use as an example the City of Houston, Texas, that has just received the flood mapping that goes on under the process of FEMA, meaning that they have described areas of residential housing where the maps are changing what is a flooding area and what is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tragedy for Houston is that these are older neighborhoods where Members of the community have invested in one of their major assets. Unfortunately, based upon FEMA's maps and the lack of infrastructure as it relates to water and flooding, these individuals are finding themselves without the opportunity to protect their property. We have got to change that. We have got to make a difference. I look forward to working with my constituents to do so.</paragraph>
