    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Sharon Richie of Watertown, SD. This month Sharon retired from the U.S. Department of Agriculture after 17 years of dedicated Federal service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sharon has worked in the multifamily housing program in Watertown for the past 15 years and is well-known and appreciated by the managers of the housing projects. She has been a dedicated employee and is well-respected for her knowledge of the program and her willingness to go the extra mile to assist her clients. Sharon has played an integral role in providing housing for low-income tenants in South Dakota throughout her career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sharon has also been an active member of the Watertown community. Prior to working for the Department of Agriculture, Sharon was a hairdresser for 25 years, as well as being a teacher's aid and substitute teacher for the Deuel School System. She also managed a supper club in Clear Lake and Altamont.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Sharon has been a valuable asset to South Dakota's agricultural community. Over the past years, she has worked facilitating several rodeos throughout the region. She has organized and judged several rodeo queen contests for groups including the PRCA, local high school and 4-H rodeos. Sharon also enjoys helping out her husband Cork with their livestock handling equipment business. She is also a mother of 9 children, a grandmother to 23 grandchildren, and a great-grandmother to 2 great-grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great honor that I rise today to remember and recognize the service provided by Sharon Richie. On behalf of the citizens of South Dakota, I wish Sharon Richie all the best in her retirement.</paragraph>
