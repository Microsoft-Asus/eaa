    <paragraph>Madam President, section 301 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation that reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. Section 301 authorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, including that the legislation not result in more than $50 billion in outlays over the period of fiscal years 2007 through  2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that <bill type="s" number="1893">S. 1893</bill>, which was reported to the Senate on July 27, 2007, and will be offered as a complete substitute to <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for SCHIP legislation. Therefore, pursuant to section 301, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Finance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
