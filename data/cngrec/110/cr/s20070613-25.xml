    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the outstanding National Night Out program in Modesto, CA. For the past 6 years, the city of Modesto has either ranked first or second in the Nation in National Night Out participation among cities with populations of 100,000 to 299,999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception in 1983, National Night Out has brought millions of Americans together to take a united stand against crime and send a clear message to criminals that citizens and neighborhoods are committed to crime prevention. National Night Out has played an instrumental role in helping to raise crime and drug prevention awareness, generate support for and participation in local anticrime programs, and perhaps most importantly, improve neighborhood spirit and strengthen community-police  partnerships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, more than 35.2 million people and 11,125 communities from all 50 States, U.S. territories, and military bases worldwide participated in the National Night Out campaign. Conscientious citizens, law enforcement agencies and civic groups came together to participate in a variety of festive events and activities such as block parties, ice cream socials, flashlight walks, and visits from law enforcement and other public agencies to help promote the importance of community involvement in local  crime-fighting programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Modesto, 123 neighborhoods participated in National Night Out last year, making it the Nation's leader among cities with populations of 100,000 to 299,999. The city of Modesto is a shining example of the importance of community and cooperation in local crime-fighting efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the residents of Modesto gather for another successful National Night Out campaign, I would like to congratulate and commend its citizens, civic leaders, and the Modesto Police Department for their leadership and willingness to help make their city a safer and better place to call home.</paragraph>
