  <narrative>DRIVER'S LICENSES FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10907]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. KUHL of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Friday of this past week, New York's Governor, Eliot Spitzer, announced his immigration policy, which allows immigrants, including those entering the country illegally, to obtain driver's licenses. This decision solidifies the need for more aggressive immigration legislation in these United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we rewarding the people who are coming here illegally at the expense of others who are law-abiding citizens?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inviting potential terrorists into the State and allowing them to drive whenever they wish undermines the preventive measures that protect our country from national security threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not forget that September 11, 2001, hijackers had at least 35 licenses which helped them to rent cars and open bank accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it will wreak havoc on our social services programs and create a massive flooding of illegal immigrants to New York State, straining our resources in our schools and our hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need real immigration legislation that strengthens our borders and does not diminish our national security by granting more privileges to those who have entered this country illegally.</paragraph>
