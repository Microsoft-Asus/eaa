    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="hr" number="856">H. Res. 856</bill>, which expresses heartfelt sympathy for the victims and families of the shootings in Omaha, Nebraska, on Wednesday, December 5, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="856">H. Res. 856</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Lee Terry on December 12, 2007, has the support of 72 Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community of Omaha, Nebraska, experienced a shooting spree at the hands of a troubled teenager carrying a rifle on December 5. Sadly, nine people died, and four others were wounded in the Westroads Mall. Thankfully, first responders, the Omaha Police Department, Douglas and Sarpy County Sheriff's Department, and Omaha Fire Department all arrived within minutes of the attacks to secure all entrances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to express great sympathy for the community's tragedy and all of the lives lost. I commend my colleague for sponsoring this measure, and I urge the swift passage of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my friend, the gentleman from California, as well as the Government Reform Committee, for making sure that this got to the floor in such a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>December 5, 2007: that will be a day forever etched in Omaha's memory as the day a lone gunman took the lives of eight innocent people at the Westroads Mall, the Von Maur store, during the holiday shopping season. But it will also be remembered as a day that revealed the true character of Omaha.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragedy, no doubt, reveals the true meaning of unity in any community. Although I will never understand the senseless events that took place in my hometown on December 5, I stand here as a proud citizen, Congressman of that district, because it's in times like these it doesn't matter what party you belong to, what your political beliefs are, your race, creed, or color. People come together and they ask what can we do to help the city and the eight innocent people. I think this is not only the  spirit of Omaha, or what defines the Omaha area, but also I think it is what exemplifies the spirit of America, and it is that spirit that we remember in each of the victims and the first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me introduce the eight innocent lives that were lost on that day. There was 53-year-old Dianne Clavin Trent,  described by her family as a gentle, generous, soft-spoken woman who loved the Lord. She loved to shop and was always smiling. She had worked in customer service at Von Maur for about 8 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have 65-year-old John McDonald, retired from Northern Natural Gas, whose daughter in fact worked with me in my law office. John was one of the heroes, when he left his place of safety to come out and start yelling, some people described it as rather passionately, at the gunman, to distract him from turning around, and a few feet away was a room where 12 other innocent people were holed up. John was shot. Amazingly, though, he was the last victim before the gunman turned the gun on himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next victim, 48-year-old Gary Scharf, who just stopped by Von Maur to pick up some Christmas presents before catching a flight out of Omaha. He grew up on a ranch outside Curtis, Nebraska, where his funeral was held. He was a proud father who leaves behind a 19-year-old son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty-six-old Gary Joy was someone everyone could count on. He loved his job and liked to write poetry. His family followed his instructions to have his organs donated. They say it was just like Gary, to help someone else. His love was with us again, if not only in spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was 36-year-old Angie Schuster, born on Valentine's Day. Her boyfriend planned to give her an engagement ring this Christmas. The priest at her funeral called Angie and her soon-to-be fiance's love the "real thing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have 67-year-old Janet Jorgensen, who just celebrated her golden anniversary, 50 years of marriage to her husband Ron just a few months ago. She went above and beyond at Van Maur, as there were many times she would shop for customers or deliver items to customers' homes. She was the seamstress and cake-maker of the family; and for her three children and eight grandchildren, she will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was 47-year-old Beverly Flynn. She took a part-time job at Von Maur because she was a mother of three beautiful girls. She was also a real estate agent, and her trademark was planting rosebushes in the yard of every new homeowner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The youngest victim, 24-year-old Maggie Webb, was the new store manager of Von Maur, one of Omaha's finest department stores. Coworkers described her as one of the nicest people they had ever worked for, someone whose whole face lit up when she smiled. A lot of people will miss her service and smile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last, I want to thank our first responders. The spirit of Omaha showed itself through the efforts of our first responders. The first phone call from the mall came to 911 dispatchers at 1:42. No voice was on the line. All that was heard were gunshots. What an eerie call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time the first responders arrived, just under 6 minutes later, the Omaha sheriff opens the doors and enters the store. What a heroic effort by our police officers, paramedics, firefighters, and others, when they got to the mall and saw such a grisly scene. The images they saw will likely haunt them for the rest of their lives. I thank the men and women who came to face the horror. Thank you for keeping us safe and saving lives. I also want to praise the spirit of Omaha for coming together  after this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I am deeply saddened by the senseless act from a troubled and disturbed teenager. It's something our city will never forget. It has scarred the very heart of our community. But I am proud of our community for its reaction and the way we came together to support the victims and begin the healing of our city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you once again to Government Reform for allowing this resolution to come forward and be part of the continuing healing in Omaha.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from the First Congressional District of Nebraska (Mr. Forten-&#xD0;berry).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400640" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from California for yielding, and I also wish to thank my colleague, Congressman Terry, for introducing this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have heard, Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, December 5, the enthusiasm of the holiday season came to an abrupt halt with an act of senseless brutality at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the Nation mourns the eight victims who were killed and the three who were wounded, and, I should add, I appreciate Mr. Terry's lengthy description of these innocent persons and their lives, I think it is also important and appropriate to recognize their uncommon heroics and great sacrifices that are now just coming to light. If there is a comfort in the midst of this difficult time, it is the beauty of the human spirit and the good that stood in the midst of this horror  and violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dianne Clavin Trent of Omaha was a 53-year-old former airline flight attendant who had worked for 8 years in customer service at the Von Maur store in the Westroads Mall. As we have now learned, Dianne did not flee when she saw the gunman. She stood. She dialed 911 and gave a description of him, and then he turned on her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gary Scharf, 48 years old, of Lincoln, Nebraska, my hometown, was an agricultural chemical sales manager in the mall to buy a dress shirt. When he heard the gunshots, Gary also called 911. It appears then that he ran from where he was safe up to where the shooting was taking place. As he ran up the escalator, he yelled out, "I called 911" in an apparent attempt to distract the gunman. He also pulled a woman off the escalator out of harm's way before the gunman turned on him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I happened to know Gary and I am proud to call him a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John McDonald was a 65-year-old grandfather and retired natural gas company manager living in Council Bluffs. When the rampage began, John took cover with his wife in the customer service area. As the gunman entered the customer service area, John stood and confronted him, and he too was shot. As now seems apparent, John's courage may have saved the lives of many other people nearby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dianne, Gary and John, innocently shopping one minute, decided in an instant to let go of a natural tendency to self-preservation and to make a great sacrifice for their fellow man. Others may have acted similarly in ways that we may never know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thought you and the American people should know of this new information. God bless all those who lost their lives or were injured that day, and God bless their loved ones.</paragraph>
