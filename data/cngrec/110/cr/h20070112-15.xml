    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a special interest over the public interest, there is no more vivid example of special interests trumping the public interest than the Medicare Part D legislation that we must reform today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extending a drug benefit to our seniors on Medicare is the right thing to do. Even in its current form, it has helped thousands of Vermonters and hundreds of thousands of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when this Medicare drug benefit was first passed, a worthy extension of this good program went terribly wrong because of the wrong-headed prohibition on the Federal Government's ability to do the obvious: negotiate fair prices for the taxpayer. This program fails on its most fundamental level, cost. Failing on cost, it impedes access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lobbyists who had such an influence in writing this bill bewildered our seniors and ripped off our taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The public interest, the interest of our seniors and taxpayers are who we represent today and who we can help today with the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
