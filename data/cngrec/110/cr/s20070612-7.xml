    <paragraph>Mr. President, with regard to the Energy bill the majority leader was speaking to, we have a pretty good sense on this side what important amendments will need to be disposed of. We hope to move forward on those amendments early in the process. Provided we are given fair treatment on getting up our amendments and voted on, I certainly agree with the majority leader this is an important issue, an issue that needs to be disposed of in the very near future. We will be working  with him to get that bill to conclusion at the earliest possible time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
