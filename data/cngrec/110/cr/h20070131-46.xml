    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support House Resolution 70, a resolution that this House passed earlier this week congratulating the University of California Santa Barbara men's soccer team for winning the NCAA Division I National Championship. I use these minutes to give my congratulations to the team and to the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with my colleague, Elton Gallegly, I am thrilled have this opportunity to congratulate every player, coach, alumnus, faculty member, and supporter of UC Santa Barbara.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 3, 2006, the UC Gauchos captured the National Championship by scoring two goals against the University of California. This is UCSB's second national title in school history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While all the Gauchos played their hearts out, I would like to acknowledge two standout performances. Sophomore Nick Perera scored a goal and assisted on Eric Avila's game winner on his way to earning All-College Cup Most Outstanding Offensive Player of the Tournament honors. Junior Andy Iro, despite playing through an injury, helped keep UCLA at bay and was named All-College Cup Most Outstanding Defensive Player.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the beginning of the Gaucho season was plagued by inconsistent play, the Gauchos fought to recover, winning 10 of their last 11 games, including six straight in the tournament. Coach Tim Vom Steeg, a UCSB alum, and his staff, Greg Wilson, Neil Jones, and Eric Foss, deserve tremendous praise not only for their impressive leadership in the 2006 season but also for leading the dominating Gauchos to their second NCAA National Championship in 3 years. Coach Vom Steeg's  colleagues  were so impressed with his coaching abilities that they named him the National Soccer Coaches Association of America National Coach of the Year, the most prestigious award that a Division I soccer coach can receive, and this for the second time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the men's soccer team is a great example of the excellence the university produces, there is much more to celebrate. As many of you know, my husband, Walter, was a professor of religious studies for more than 30 years at this campus at UCSB before he became a Member of Congress. Through his experience as a professor and my own as a graduate, I have watched this university rightfully gain national attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University currently has five Nobel Laureates on faculty and was recently ranked in the top 15 best public schools in the Nation by U.S. News and World Report; and with a breathtakingly beautiful campus, it is no wonder that the men's soccer team and the University can attract such notable talent from all over the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If any of my colleagues ever find themselves on California's central coast, I encourage you to stop by this beautiful campus and see for yourself all that it has to offer. Of course, don't forget to catch a soccer game at Harder Stadium. Go Gauchos.</paragraph>
