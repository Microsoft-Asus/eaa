    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the University of South Dakota Coyotes women's basketball team on their second place finish in the 2008 NCAA Division II Tournament. This was USD's first trip to the National Championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USD women's basketball team has a long history of success, including three NCC Conference Championships from 1982 to 1985, as well as eight appearances in the NCAA Division II National Tournament. South Dakota, which concluded the season with a 33 and 2 overall record, won the North Central Conference with a 12 and 0 record. This was USD's final season in Division II athletics and it was undoubtedly one of the best in school history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, this historic season would not have been possible without the players themselves. The members of the 2007-2008 University of South Dakota women's basketball team are as follows: Natalie Carda, Shannon Daly, Michelle Dirks, Anne Doshier, Kelli Fargen, Amber Hegge, Jeana Hoffman, Jenna Hoffman, Kara Iverson, Jasmine Mosley, Amy Robinette, Ashley Robinette, Annie Roche, Kendra Schomer, Bridget Yoerger, Maggie Youngberg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this accomplishment was truly a team effort, I would like to pay special recognition to their coach Chad Lavin, who will be retiring after 14 years with the USD women's basketball team. Coach Lavin is USD's career wins leader with 271. Lavin's coaching success has not gone unnoticed as he has been named the NCC Coach of the Year four different times and has been selected as the Russell Athletic/WBCA North Central Regional Coach of the Year for the 2007-2008 season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coaches and student athletes of USD's women's basketball team should be very proud of all of their remarkable achievements this season. On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I am pleased to say congratulations to the Coyotes on this impressive season.</paragraph>
