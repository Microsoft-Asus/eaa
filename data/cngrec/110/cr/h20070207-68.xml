    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of football all-star and community hero Ray Beck, who passed away recently in Cedartown, Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Beck is a football legend both in my home State of Georgia and across the Nation. After 4 years as a star on the Cedartown High School football team, Ray attended Georgia Tech, my alma mater, to play guard for the legendary coach Bobby Dodd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1951, he was named an All-American by the American Football Coaches Association and the Football Writers Association. That same year, he helped lead Georgia Tech to an 11-1 record and an Orange Bowl victory over Baylor University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After college, Beck was drafted by the New York Giants. He was part of the 1956 World Championship Team. And Madam Speaker, that team included the likes of Y.A. Tittle, Kyle Rote and Sam Huff. They led the Giants to a 56-7 victory over the Chicago Bears, a far more lopsided score than the Indianapolis Colts achieved this past weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the football field, Ray was known as a team player, someone who gave his all to the game. Because of his tremendous work ethic he was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Ray was more than just a football player. He was an active and enthusiastic supporter of the Cedartown community. The same attitude that made him a star on the field made him a hero in his community. There is hardly an organization in Cedartown that hasn't been touched by Beck's generosity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, he was chairman of the Cedartown Development Authority. He was president of the Cedartown Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Polk Medical Center Advisory Board, a board member of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But perhaps he will be best remembered for a charity golf tournament he arranged with his long time friend, Doc Ayers. This annual event raised thousands of dollars for Polk County, for charities such as children's literacy and all the way to local food banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a little wonder Beck was named Citizen of Excellence by the Cedartown  Civic Arts Commission for his philanthropy to this great community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Ray's former teammates commented that he was, and I quote, "one of the people you could always count on." Ray took that attitude from the football field to the community of Cedartown, and his contributions to both will live on as his legacy. I send my deepest, deepest condolences to his wife, Claire, and to his whole family. I know all of Polk County mourns your loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a younger generation looks to sport stars as heroes and role models, I hope they come across men like Ray Beck. He was committed to his team and committed to his community. He gave his all on the field and then gave back to the town where he was raised. He was generous with his time, his wisdom and his energy, and Cedartown, Georgia, is a far, far better place because of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in honoring the legacy of Ray Beck.</paragraph>
