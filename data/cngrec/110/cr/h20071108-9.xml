    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Democrats have failed in their misguided attempt to hold veterans spending hostage. Yesterday the Senate voted to delink the MilCon-VA bill from the Labor-HHS conference report. The Senate's action was commendable and should have been expected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans groups from around the Nation have made it clear it is wrong and cynical to use their bill for political purposes. Now the Democratic majority is saying they will not even try to have this vital legislation on the President's desk by Veterans Day. But there is a way out of this box.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I introduced the MilCon-VA conference agreement as a stand- alone bill, <bill type="h" number="4104">H.R. 4104</bill>. It is identical to the bill already agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators. It could be passed today by unanimous consent and immediately sent to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members who are tired of the political games should cosponsor this bill and urge Speaker Pelosi to take it up today.</paragraph>
