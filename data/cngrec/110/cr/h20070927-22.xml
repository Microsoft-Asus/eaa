    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the FFA, commonly known as the Future Farmers of America, on the news that for the first time in 29 years, their student membership has passed 500,000 students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is encouraging to see groups like the FFA growing and adding new members. Through the FFA, young people in rural and urban areas alike are able to understand agriculture's economic, social and environmental impact on all Americans, as well as agriculture's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agriculture is not so much of a vocation as it is a way of life. Owning and operating a farm or ranch is a labor of love, costing time, money, risk and other investments far above most careers. The FFA prepares the next generation of our Nation's family farmers as they step up on the plate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, agriculture matters. I'm proud to represent the Third District of Nebraska, one of the largest agricultural districts in the country, and one which truly embodies the spirit of the FFA.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
