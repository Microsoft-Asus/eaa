  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we just finished looking at two very important legislative initiatives by the Democratic leadership and as well a bipartisan effort dealing with issues like Head Start and the National Science Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you look at the question of education, I rise today to talk of the plight of historically black colleges in America. It is important that we recognize that America's competitive edge will be based upon the opportunities for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed in the U.S. Department of Education's failure to fully enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act, title VI, and one of the victims of that failure of enforcement are schools in Texas, Texas Southern University and Prairie View A&amp;M. It has now become a national issue, an issue of importance to America because we are falling behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the National Science Foundation legislation was important, but it is now also important for the U.S. Department of Education to wake up and do its job in protecting the Nation's historically black colleges.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
