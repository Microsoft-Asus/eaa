    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 2,600 men and women of the Minnesota National Guard who, after serving our country with great honor and courage, are returning home from their 16-month deployment to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Friday my friend and colleague, Congressman Tim Walz, and I had the privilege of visiting Volk Field near Fort McCoy in Wisconsin and welcoming home soldiers from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division, the famed "Red Bulls." It was truly a memorable experience greeting these proud soldiers as they returned from the longest combat deployment of any Army brigade combat team in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota's "Red Bulls" escorted supply convoys and traveled 2.4 million miles in Iraq. Other members of the BCT provided essential security to U.S. bases throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking with the fine men and women of the "Red Bulls" as they stepped off the plane and smelled that clean, fresh air and stepped on American soil, it became clear that these soldiers are justifiably proud of their accomplishments. The great State of Minnesota and all Americans can be proud as well.</paragraph>
