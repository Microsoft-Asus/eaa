    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor two great community leaders from Decatur, Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Horace "Buck" Livingston is a local civil rights activist who sought higher-paying jobs and better education for African Americans. For over 40 years, he has published the African American Voice, the only African American newspaper within 150 miles of Decatur, Illinois. His tireless efforts continue to strengthen our community and give all of us hope for a better future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William "Skip" Dempsey, my brother in the labor movement, sadly passed away on April 13. After teaching at Purdue University, Skip served for over 12 years as training coordinator for Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 65. He continued his leadership as a business agent, advancing education, economic growth, and the building trades in the Decatur area. Skip's valuable service will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the extraordinary and unselfish contributions of Buck Livingstong and Skip Dempsey.</paragraph>
