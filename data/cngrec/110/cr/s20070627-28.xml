  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 12, 2007, in Crothersville, IN, Coleman King and Garrett Gray beat a man to death for allegedly making a sexual proposition to one of them. As the two young men were returning to Gray's house from an errand that day, they picked up 35-year-old Aaron Hall. The two men told police that Hall had propositioned King; in retaliation, King and Gray began to beat Hall. The two men allegedly struck Hall until his eyes were swollen shut and he was spitting blood. They then carted him off to a  ditch, continued to beat him and left him for dead. The two men drove back to the ditch with a shotgun later that day in order to make sure Hall was dead, but found him instead several days later dead in a nearby field, where he had apparently crawled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
