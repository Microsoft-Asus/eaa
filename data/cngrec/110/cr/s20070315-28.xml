  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of the need to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act expired September 30, 2006, and now over 700 counties and 4,400 school districts in 39 States are in financial limbo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In simple terms, this means that 8 million kids in rural America are going to be impacted by Congress's inaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been joined by several of my colleagues in introducing, <bill type="s" number="779">S. 779</bill>, a simple one year reauthorization. This measure would provide some certainty to the impacted counties and schools while Congress works to address the larger issue of a multiyear reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to me that the safety net payments need to continue, but in a manner that encourages and focuses on building collaboration--one of the cornerstones of this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For my colleagues who are unfamiliar with this issue, let me quickly review how the Congress got to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1992, Congress provided some counties in the Pacific Northwest with a temporary financial "safety net" to help them transition from the timber boom years of the 1980s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The safety net was scheduled to gradually phase out over a 10-year period, but demands for a more inclusive program resulted in its early termination and the enactment of another temporary program, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act was designed to allow counties an opportunity to transition back to the traditional revenue sharing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The temporary safety net was originally recommended to Congress by the National Forest County Schools Coalition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the Coalition's principles States that special payments to States under this legislation will provide a short-term safety net with a specific termination date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The county payments program dramatically broadened the geographical and substantive scope of the original safety net payment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The large majority of the funds still were focused on the Pacific Northwest, but the new national program permitted most States and counties across the country to participate and benefit from it thus, providing a measure of financial certainty to all counties that rely on revenues from Federal forest lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act has been an enormous success, not just achieving but surpassing the goals of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This act has restored programs for students in rural areas and prevented the closure of numerous isolated schools. It has been a primary funding mechanism to provide rural school students with educational opportunities comparable to those enjoyed by suburban and urban students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, the act has allowed rural county road districts to address the severe maintenance backlog. Snow removal has been restored for citizens, tourists, and school buses. Bridges have been upgraded and replaced, and culverts that are hazardous to fish passage have been upgraded and replaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, over 70 Resource Advisory Committees, or RACs, have been formed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationally, these 15-person diverse RAC stakeholder committees have studied and approved more than 2,500 projects on Federal forestlands and adjacent public and private lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These projects have addressed a wide variety of improvements drastically needed on our public lands. Projects have included fuels reduction, habitat improvement, watershed restoration, road maintenance and rehabilitation, reforestation, campground and trail improvement, and noxious weed eradication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>RACs are a new and powerful partnership between county governments and the land management agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are rapidly building the capacity for collaborative public land management decision making in over 150 of our largest forest counties in America and are reducing the gridlock over public land management, community by community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the future, I feel the RACs will be providing the leadership to build consensus for projects that will keep our  forests healthy and as a result generate revenue for future projects, counties, and schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The achievements of this act over the last few years are positive and substantial. This law should be extended so it can continue to benefit the forest counties, their schools, and continue to contribute to improving the health of our public lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do not work to reauthorize this act, all of the progress of the last 6 years will be lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Schools in timber dependant communities will lose a substantial part of their funding. These school districts will have to start making tough budget decisions such as keeping or canceling after school programs, sports programs, music programs, and trying to determine what is the basic educational needs of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, counties will have to reprioritize road maintenance so that only the essential services of the county are met because that is all they will be able to afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress needs to act now in order to ensure a future for rural schools and counties.</paragraph>
