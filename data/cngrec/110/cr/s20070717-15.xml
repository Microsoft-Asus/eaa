  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me speak for a minute about this legislation. I understand Senator DeMint's need to object on behalf of the Senator from Oklahoma. This is legislation that has broad--I do mean broad--bipartisan support. It was passed out of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee on a unanimous vote. It now represents a very broad compromise worked on with the administration and with all of the members of the committee, both Republican and Democrat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will review very quickly what this bill does. As everybody knows, when Katrina hit, we had a terrible time getting small business assistance to the countless thousands of small businesses that were impacted, not only in New Orleans but in Baton Rouge and across into Mississippi, Alabama, and elsewhere, where there were many services being provided by other folks. A lot of small businesses were impacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We learned there was not an adequate capacity within the Small Business Administration to deliver this kind of assistance in a rapid way. So we have worked now, after a series of hearings and over the course of 2 years, to pull together the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvement Act. It does a number of things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It creates a new elevated level of disaster declaration, referred to as catastrophic national disaster. That triggers nationwide economic injury disaster loans for adversely affected small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it requires the SBA to create an expedited disaster assistance business loan program to provide businesses with expedited access to short-term money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of the businesses in New Orleans could have survived and might have survived or chosen to try to if there had been some bridge money or available working capital. But the absence of it forced a lot of them to close their doors. If we can provide assistance in a timely fashion, obviously subject to the administration's approval--and there is discretion in the bill--we would have the ability to do a better job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there are improvements to the existing loan program which have been written in the bill. There is improved agency coordination and marketing. It directs the SBA to coordinate with FEMA in a more effective way. It directs the SBA to create a proactive marketing plan to make the public aware of the disaster response services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it provides improved planning and oversight and directs the SBA to update the hurricane response plan to address all future disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is, as I say, with bipartisan support. I have a letter from the Administrator of the SBA, Steve Preston. He writes saying:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am writing to express my thanks for the efforts you and your colleagues have made to work with the Small Business Administration and to address the administration's concerns with some of the provisions in <bill type="s" number="163">S. 163</bill>, the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvement Act of 2007. At this point, if amended by the Bond amendment--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is what we just sought to do--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the administration has no objections to Senate passage of <bill type="s" number="163">S. 163</bill>. However, the administration would consider a longer extension of the authorization language in section 3 to avoid the need for concern over unintended expiration of programs and activities.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would obviously love to do that. It appears there is one person in the Senate, the Senator from Oklahoma, who is opposed to moving forward with this legislation. As I say, there was a unanimous vote by our committee, which wants to see if we could achieve this disaster assistance. Nobody understands how critical this is more than the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, who has been fighting from the moment Katrina hit to try to get this kind of disaster assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to ask the Senator if she would share with us her observations as to why this legislation is so critical and what specifically we have done to address some of the concerns of those who had previously expressed those concerns in order now to have a consensus about this legislation. I ask the Senator from Louisiana if she would explain the situation in New Orleans, not just then but now, and why this legislation is so critical.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I begin by saying that his leadership has been on point and so focused for the last 2 years in trying to help lead his committee, with the support and cooperation of his ranking member, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, to move Congress to adopt this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator is absolutely correct that the SBA was one of several important Federal agencies that was caught flatfooted when Katrina and Rita hit the gulf coast and subsequently when the Federal levee system failed in multiple places, as the Senator from Massachusetts knows because he has walked through neighborhood after neighborhood, mile after mile, having visited with business owners and homeowners who lost everything they had, that took them generations to build. The Senator knows very well  that this particular administration was anemic and very slow in its response. In fact, the gentleman leading it at the time was not the appropriate leader. To the President's credit, they have nominated and we have confirmed a new leader for the SBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the Senator from Massachusetts will agree with me that the Director, Steve Preston, is making some very good and fundamental changes. But there is just so much this administrator can do without Congress doing its job to give him the tools he needs to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why this legislation is being held up by the Republican side I am not sure. It is very disappointing, not just to me but to the millions of people who are affected and are still struggling, having lost everything or having at risk everything they own because we cannot seem to get legislation passed because of obstructionist tactics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I repeat, this bill is supported not only by the Chair but by the ranking member. In addition, both Senators from Louisiana are cosponsoring this bill, Senator Bill Nelson from Florida, who has experienced the disasters of hurricanes in Florida, and Senator Johnny Isakson from Georgia, who also has experienced disasters. This is not a Democratic bill being rammed down the Republican side of the aisle. This is a good Government efficiency, effective measure to try to reform the  SBA. But because of bureaucratic delays, because of the inadequacy of the current law, we were not able to help the 18,000 businesses that were destroyed, many of them--I would say 97 percent of them--small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Massachusetts and I together visited a cleaning business for hospital bedding and other items that was--I cannot think of the name of the business, but the Senator from Massachusetts and I walked throughout New Orleans East. This is one of hundreds of businesses that not only found themselves flooded, but when the waters receded, the hospitals they had serviced had closed. So basically through no fault of their own, they were struggling as well. This legislation will help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not only important to the gulf coast and to the 18,000 businesses, many of them small businesses, that need help and assistance, but it is for the future. The Senator from Massachusetts is saying let this Federal Government do better. If we believe business is important, and we do, and if we believe small business is important, and it is, then let's at least have our response honed and tuned to the point where if, God forbid, another huge disaster happens, we will be much more prepared  than we were last time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our constituents depend on us to be responsive. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, that is exactly what this bill does. I again thank him for his leadership and express truly my outrage that this is being held up for no apparent good reason at the expense of thousands of business owners who are looking to us for help and support.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. She has been not only a terrific member of the committee but has represented to the whole Senate countless numbers of times on the floor the plight of those folks down in New Orleans and in the immediate surrounding area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to emphasize what she has said and what I said previously, and that is this has been worked on now for 2 years in a bipartisan way. Senator Snowe, the ranking member, who was, incidentally, the Chair when we first began working on this legislation, has supported the efforts to try to make certain that we address these concerns. Other Republican members of the committee have contributed significantly to this effort. Senator Bond had concerns about the energy program. We  have addressed those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can move forward. We tried actually to reach out to whatever opposition there is with respect to this bill. We are happy to sit down and address any legitimate concerns. But at this point, this is long overdue. We are into the hurricane season now, about a month and a half into it. Our predictors have been pretty accurate in these past years, and they are suggesting we are going to have a very significant number of named storms and maybe as many as 10 projected full-blown hurricanes  this year, with 13 to 17 named storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, they hit the number of named storms and hurricanes, but we were very lucky; they didn't blow into the shore and we didn't get hit. Obviously, we cannot sit around and be lucky all the time. We cannot afford another Katrina-like response. There are specific actions this legislation empowers the SBA to do to take steps proactively, to be in a position to address the concerns of small businesses rapidly. In addition, this bill helps private lenders get in early on and be immediately on  the scene and assist in the process of providing those loans. So it streamlines that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to comment on Senator Landrieu's reference to that cleaning place we visited in East New Orleans. We made arrangements to go down and see that place because we knew it needed help. We had talked with the CEO before going there. About a week and a half later, when we got there, we went into this cleaning facility, which had been completely flooded, as the Senator said. They cleaned it out themselves. They worked diligently to get the equipment up and working, what they could. Much  of it was ruined and was going to have to be disposed of. But these folks were working this place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since they were dependent on the services of hotels and others for the work they did, they were at the time mostly doing the hospitals that had reopened, and that was it. But the CEO was so despairing in the span of that week and a half or so between our making the appointment and getting there that when we arrived, the CEO had left with his family, taken off; that was it, he had enough, and left in charge was one of the workers who was the "acting CEO" who was desperately trying to hold onto  this business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When people are working like that and run into that kind of desperation, we have to be able to look them in the eye and say we have done everything possible. We put in place the mechanisms they pay for and that they have a right to expect will be there to assist in that kind of an emergency. That is what we are trying to do here, in a bipartisan way, to make certain we don't lose CEOs, lose jobs, lose workers, and lose hope as a consequence of our inaction in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we are going to be able to come back to this in short order. As I say, I think we have worked in good faith with every legitimate question that has been raised with respect to this legislation. We will happily sit down if another Senator still has a concern, but we certainly will not tolerate--and at some point I hope the leader will allow us to take the time in the Senate to continue on the floor with this legislation. There is one Senator who is opposing it, without any rationale  whatsoever.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>May I add something, if the Senator will yield?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will yield to the Senator.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have all learned many things since this disaster happened, and one of the things we have learned, I guess rather painfully, is that it is not only the geographic area that is struck by the high wind, the high waters or the flood waters that is impacted by a catastrophic disaster, but it is also the perimeter of the area, the towns that absorb people fleeing to higher ground and trying to settle where they can find work and schools for their children, and businesses that might  not have been directly impacted but have lost half or 75 percent of their customer base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, without Senator Kerry's bill, there is virtually no authorization on the Federal books to allow loans to be made to these kinds of businesses. So because we don't have that authorization, we are, right now, basically making the disaster worse. I hope people can understand this. We, by our inaction, by our hardheadedness--and it is not me, although I can be hardheaded but not on this issue--because of some leadership decision on the Republican side, we are literally, right  now, making this matter worse. Businesses are continuing to go out of business; businesses that didn't have a drop of water, businesses that didn't have one shingle let loose from the high wind continue to file bankruptcy and put up out-of-business signs because there is no provision to allow low-interest loans to them if they weren't directly impacted. Unfortunately, they are directly impacted in terms of loss of customers, et cetera.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it is going to bring in the private sector. We heard a lot from the other side about Government can't do everything; let the private sector be engaged. Well, your bill allows for more private-sector involvement; does it not? It allows the banks that know these small businesses to be a part of helping them. This is what the business community wants, this is what the banks want, and this is what we recognized was a problem initially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet we are being blocked, I understand, by the Senator from Oklahoma, who has not made his specific objections clear to us. So I hope they can be made clear, and if we can fix it, fine. If not, then the leadership on the Republican side, I would say to the Senator from Massachusetts, has a decision: Do they want to be part of the nonsensical opposition by a Senator who is in Oklahoma, who is never going to have a hurricane or do they want to stand with the people in America from New York to Texas  who are threatened every 9 months with a hurricane season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the decision the Republican leader from Kentucky is going to have to answer. Is he going to support a bipartisan piece of legislation that aids businesses that are literally threatened from New York to Texas or is he going to stand with some nonsensical opposition coming from the middle of the country that will never be hit by a hurricane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hate to be so pointed about it, but that is basically where it is. This is 2 years after the storm. This isn't 2 months or 6 months after. This is a bill that Senator Snowe herself started and Senator Kerry is finishing, and the people of the gulf coast are still waiting. So this is a real leadership question, and I hope that as the day goes by and the week goes by, we can make some progress, and I thank the Senator for his leadership.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. As I said previously, she has been tireless on this. Louisiana has been lucky to have her intervention every step of the way. The billions of dollars that have gone down there is a consequence of the hard work she has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me summarize what is being obstructed. First, expedited assistance from the SBA to small businesses injured by a disaster; second, private disaster loans. Private disaster loans. The ability of private-sector lenders to become involved in the process quickly, extending credit to the folks who need it as a consequence of that disaster, which, incidentally, can only occur when the President of the United States has legitimately declared a disaster; third, improvements to the existing program;  why we wouldn't want to improve the existing program after we saw how it was incapable of meeting the problems of Katrina is beyond me. That is what we are doing here in a complete and total bipartisan, unanimous committee vote that suggests these improvements are important and will make a difference; improved agency coordination in marketing. These are the things that make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Small Business Administrator, Steve Preston.</paragraph>

  <narrative>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, June 29, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to express my thanks for the efforts you and your colleagues have made to work with the U.S. Small Business Administration and to address the Administration's concerns with some of the provisions in <bill type="s" number="163">S. 163</bill>, "The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2007".</narrative>
  <narrative>At this point, if amended by the Bond Amendment, the Administration has no objections to Senate passage of <bill type="s" number="163">S. 163</bill>. However, the Administration would request a longer extension of the authorization language in section 3 to avoid the need for concern over unintended expiration of programs and activities. We would also recommend clarifying that the Administrator would have flexibility under section 205 to designate portions of a declared catastrophic national disaster area as a HUBZone area, without  extending this designation to an entire disaster area.</narrative>
  <narrative>We look forward to working with you when the bill goes into conference discussions with the U.S. House of Representatives. If you have any questions or comments, please contact me directly.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely yours,</narrative>
