  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of amendment No. 1572, the DRIVE Electric amendment. Senator Salazar is the sponsor. Senators Bayh, Brownback, Coleman, Klobuchar, Smith, Clinton, Alexander, Biden, and I are cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I speak for my fellow DRIVE Act cosponsors when I thank the members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, led by Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Domenici, for reporting versions of DRIVE Act provisions out of that committee in May. And I know my fellow DRIVE Act cosponsors are as gratified as I am that Chairman Bingaman and 62 other Senators voted Tuesday to adopt the DRIVE Act's original oil savings requirement as part of this Energy bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the debate preceding Tuesday's vote, Senator Domenici said that Congress should not abdicate its responsibility to spell out the policies that the Federal Government will use to achieve the oil savings targets that now are part of this Energy bill. I could not agree more. That is why my DRIVE Act cosponsors are back here today to boost the Energy bill's transportation electrification provisions up to their original DRIVE Act strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once restored to its original strength, the DRIVE Act's electrification program will give the Federal Government a vital tool that will take this Nation a considerable distance toward the oil savings targets that the Senate adopted on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, our transportation sector runs on oil. That is the problem the Senate is trying to solve with this Energy bill. We are passing a law in order to move our transportation sector off of oil, in part by moving it onto alternative fuels. In expanding the use of various alternative fuels, we should not overlook our own existing electrical grid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most electricity generation in this country is fueled by domestically mined coal. A substantial amount of electricity generation in this country is fueled by uranium mined in the United States or Canada. While only a small amount of electricity is generated in the U.S. using renewable sources such as solar and geothermal energy, we know we can increase that amount substantially. Only 2 percent of the electricity generated in this country is generated using oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the more that we use electricity to power our cars, trucks, trains, and ships, the more we will be using domestic energy sources, and the less dependent we will be on oil. Fortunately, the technology is now available to allow us to plug in our cars at night, when existing powerplants are underused and electricity is especially cheap, so that during the day, the cars run largely on battery power. And the technology is now available to allow trucks to plug in at truck stops--and ships to plug  in at ports--so that they don't use oil to run their on-board systems when they're stationary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The founder of a U.S. company called A123 testified before my global warming subcommittee in May about durable, safe, light-weight, high-capacity batteries his company has developed for vehicle use. He is using that technology to convert hybrid vehicles into  plug-in hybrids today. He drives such a car every day. It gets 150 miles to the gallon. The electricity that it takes to drive the vehicle 40 miles costs about one-tenth as much as it costs to drive  the same distance on gasoline. I understand that General Motors believes it can start selling such plug-in hybrid vehicles to American consumers within the next 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same hearing in May, the head of global research at General Electric testified that the company had already developed a hybrid electric locomotive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even if you count the pollution from the powerplants--including coal-fired powerplants--used to charge a plug-in hybrid or fully electric vehicle, or to run an idling truck or ship, powering these vehicles with electricity releases far, far less pollution into the environment than powering them with oil does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill contains some language to help accelerate the deployment of these electrification technologies in the transportation sector. The DRIVE Electric amendment would strengthen those provisions substantially. There is broad, bipartisan support here in the Senate for strengthening them. There is no reason not to strengthen them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what the DRIVE Electric amendment would do: The DRIVE Electric amendment would expand the Advanced Transportation Technology Program in section 245 of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> and augment the Energy Storage Competitiveness Program in section 244 of <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More specifically, the DRIVE Electric amendment would expand the near-term vehicle technology deployment program in the underlying bill by adding a revolving loan program. This will maximize the effectiveness of the program in stimulating the installation of technologies to reduce petroleum use and cut emissions. In addition, the amendment sets forth types of projects--including port, truck stop and airport electrification--that will qualify for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment includes a program to remove barriers for existing and new applications of electric drive and hybrid transportation technologies. It would establish an electricity usage program to increase the understanding of and management of the electricity grid as a source of power for the transportation sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would also direct the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop information on the grid-side of electric drive technology. It would authorize grants for electric utilities to promote customer programs for load management and off-peak use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the underlying bill would allow for basic and applied energy storage research, the DRIVE Electric amendment would establish an electric drive transportation research and development program. That program would address additional research needs, including: high efficiency on-board and off-board charging components; high power and energy-efficient drive-train systems for passenger and commercial vehicles and for nonroad vehicles; control system development and power-train development and  integration; application of nano-materials technology, and use of smart vehicle and grid interconnection devices and software.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also would direct the Energy Department to evaluate the benefits of plug-in electric drive technology, by creating testing programs to assess the full potential of benefits in terms of reducing criteria air pollutant emissions, energy use, and petroleum consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also would establish a nationwide education program for electric drive transportation technology, including financial assistance to create new university-level degree programs for needed engineers, supporting student plug-in hybrid electric vehicle competitions, and other educational efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the amendment would update the fleet acquisition program established under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to assure that fleet operators subject to that law can choose electric drive transportation technologies, including hybrid electric vehicles, for compliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this amendment is exactly the kind of commonsense, win-win, bipartisan measure that the American people like to see coming out of Congress. I respectfully ask that my colleagues support the DRIVE Electric amendment.</paragraph>
