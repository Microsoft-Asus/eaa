    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand here today with my colleague from Arkansas to honor and remember a fellow Arkansan who dedicated his life to serving the public and upholding justice across our great Nation. Texarkana native Judge Richard Arnold spent his lifetime in the court system, from the U.S. District Court to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he rose to be chief judge in 1992. Judge Arnold even ran for Congress for the seat which I now hold, Arkansas Fourth Congressional  District, before he began his distinguished legal career in the Federal court system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the new United States Federal Courthouse in Little Rock, Arkansas, which will be dedicated tomorrow, will be forever named the Richard Sheppard Arnold United States Courthouse. Judge Arnold was admired for his fairness and will be forever remembered as a dedicated public servant who cared deeply about his family, his work, his State, and his country. I am honored to deliver these remarks as a tribute to his life and career.</paragraph>
