    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the memory of one of the great jurists in the history of my State and someone I was honored to call a friend and mentor: Judge Thomas Fairchild.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Fairchild earned the respect of all who knew him for his keen mind, his kind manner, and his humility. His long and distinguished career in public service included serving as Wisconsin's attorney general, as a State supreme court justice, and as Federal appeals court judge on the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where he rose to become chief judge. He held that position from 1975 to 1981 when he became a senior judge on the appeals court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Fairchild stood for justice and equality in his work on the bench, and his work in politics as he made a courageous run for Senate against Joe McCarthy in 1952. Through that and other efforts, he played a critical role in efforts to revitalize the State's Democratic Party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Fairchild was a brilliant legal mind and a man of exceptional character. He was also an extremely special person in my family and a great friend of my father's. As is the case with anyone who has known me for more than 40 years, he called me Rusty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whenever my father, Leon Feingold, or my mother, Sylvia Feingold, referred to Judge Fairchild, it was always with reverence. Some of the biggest decisions of his career were made, at least in part, in our living room. I have always been deeply proud of that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Thomas E. Fairchild lecture at University of Wisconsin Law School, established in 1988 as a tribute to Judge Fairchild, is just one reflection of his tremendous stature in Wisconsin. When I delivered the Fairchild lecture in 2005, with Judge Fairchild listening in the audience, it was a great honor for me, and a wonderful experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply saddened by the passing of Judge Fairchild, for the loss this means for his family, and for all those who knew him. He was one of our State's great legal minds, and one of our most dedicated public servants. I feel so fortunate to have known him, and so grateful for the many things he taught me and the many kindnesses he showed me over the years. The work he did, and the life he lived, will continue to enrich Wisconsin and the Nation for many years to come.</paragraph>
