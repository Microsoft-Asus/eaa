  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, a good man and former chairman of the House Budget Committee will be honored by his colleagues. A portrait of Jim Nussle will be unveiled and displayed in the committee room where he held the gavel for 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Nussle is a passionate man. He strongly believes that we are sent to Washington to be good stewards for taxpayers, and he was one of their best advocates. Under Jim's leadership of the Budget Committee, and for the first time in nearly a decade, we took a first step in reforming our mandatory, or entitlement, spending, the largest and least sustainable part of our budget, saving taxpayers nearly $40 billion over the next years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim also worked to reform the budget process itself and reached across the aisle to develop a bipartisan solution. He coauthored the Comprehensive Budget Process Reform Act in 1988 with Representative Ben Cardin. He has also supported the legislative line item veto and earmark reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given his experience, knowledge and commitment to public service, it is fitting that the President has selected Jim as his nominee for Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</paragraph>
