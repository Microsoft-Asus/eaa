    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I turn to the Senator from Florida, I wish to say that I sit through these prayers every day. It is really good for me to do that. But the words that were uttered by Dr. Swanson this morning, as Johnny Cash says in that song, "you've been reading my mail" were really important to me, and I am sure every Senator listening to this prayer felt the same way I did. I am going to get a copy of that prayer and read it once in a while because he was talking about me  when he gave that prayer and talking about Senator Nelson, Senator Baucus, and all of us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, he was talking about all of us in lifting the burdens and the burdens we gladly bear. The pastor's prayer reminded us of our need to have a servant heart, to serve the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Swanson is very much a part of our Orlando community. He is my personal pastor, as Grace and I are members of the First Presbyterian Church of Orlando. He is illustrative of the great pastoral leadership we have had in Orlando.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks ago, we had my 30-year friend, the just-retired pastor of the First Baptist Church of Orlando, Jim Henry, here. He is one of the great leaders of the faith. We have had in this Chamber Rev. Sam Green of St. Mark A.M.E. Church, now Bishop Sam Green in a district in South Africa, another one of the great pastors of our region in central Florida. We will be having another one of the great pastors, Rev. Willie Barnes of the Baptist Church in Eatonville, FL, another one of my personal  friends and one of the great pastors we have been blessed to have in our region. What they talk about, as Dr. Swanson said so eloquently in his prayer, is the unity of what was taught in the ancient Scriptures and the New Testament; that is, servant leadership. That was so well expressed in the life of Jesus, who was a role model as a leader but as a servant leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We welcome these pastors, and particularly we welcome Dr. Swanson today to the Senate.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader.</chair>
