    <paragraph>Mr. President, the chairman of the Finance Committee has voiced concern about the original revenue loss associated with our amendment, which is bipartisan, with several members of the Finance Committee as sponsors. Senator Stabenow and I have worked very hard with Finance Committee staff and the Joint Committee on Taxation to bring the revenue estimate down. We managed to cut it by two-thirds to about $1.3 billion over 10 years. I am pleased Senator Baucus finds  it acceptable and now supports my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now like to turn the floor over to Senator Stabenow.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say, part of this recovery is to support those businesses currently not making a profit but that want to continue to invest in America and American jobs. That is the piece we address in this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, under the rules, technically someone on the minority side would manage the time, theoretically, in opposition to this amendment. I do not see anyone here. Not to be too formal about this, I will speak anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Ohio, as well as the Senator from Michigan, for working out this amendment. Very basically, they have a very good point; namely, that many businesses, particularly in some parts of the country, are not able to take full advantage of bonus depreciation or so-called 179 expensing. That is because these are companies that have no profits. They do not have the ability to take advantage of these depreciation write-downs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So they have come up with an amendment to address that problem. The first version was a bit expensive. We have worked very closely together with the Senators, as well as with the Joint Committee on Tax, to find the proper amount that makes some sense, and it has been tailored down to about $1.3 billion. That is the modification which was sent to the desk by the Senator from Ohio. I think that is a proper amount. I think it is very helpful and ought to help these companies in these very stressed  parts of our country that very much need the benefit of this provision. So I accept the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding me an opportunity to speak. This is an example of how those in Government can work together to help citizens who have been disadvantaged by a storm, where Members can work together in a bipartisan manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Louisiana will be able to explain briefly the base amendment she offered. I simply want to thank her for agreeing to incorporate two very important amendments into hers. One is with regard to the bonus depreciation piece of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act, known in shorthand as the GO-Zone. Because of bureaucratic delays, and because of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina, people who wish to take the opportunity of the GO-Zone bonus depreciation have not been able to commence construction.  The Wicker-Cochran amendment, which the Senator has agreed to incorporate into her amendment, would move the commencement date of GO-Zone construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Louisiana has also graciously agreed to add a Brownback-Roberts amendment that will help the small town of Greensburg, KS, which was completely devastated in a storm recently. I urge all Senators to vote in favor of this simple change in the date on bonus depreciation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Dodd is going to be here, as will Senator Baucus, for offering of amendments. It is my understanding there are a number of tax related amendments that will be offered. Senator Ensign, Senator Bill Nelson, and Senator Snowe have amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the benefit of Members, I wish to lay out generally what the plan is for next week. We will have no votes on Monday. That has been long scheduled. The Republican leader and I will work out what is going to happen on Tuesday. There are a couple alternatives. I discussed it briefly this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a cloture motion waiting to file. Whether we do that or not, I will consult with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Kentucky.

There are a huge number of people expected to be at that mass, so we will have a window so Members and staff who wish to attend the mass will be able to do so.

    <paragraph>A better procedure is not to line up second degrees because nobody's second-degree rights are ever denied anyway on any amendment. That is automatic. For  example, when Senator Ensign's amendment is offered, if somebody wants to offer a second-degree amendment, that is certainly in order. The unanimous consent request would not preclude someone from offering a second-degree amendment. The Senator always has that right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to get in the position of getting UCs for one second-degree amendment or another at this point, especially when, I say to my good friend from Tennessee, it is not necessary in any way. He will be fully protected when the amendment of the Senator from Nevada is up. He is protected to offer a second degree.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mr. Thune, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 4419 to amendment No. 4387.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="NOT VOTING--21">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <narrative>(The amendment is printed in today's Record under "Text of Amendments.")</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="NOT VOTING--21">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Cantwell and Thune be added as cosponsors to the amendment. I am sure there will be others who will want to be added as cosponsors to this amendment. Since Senator Cantwell and I introduced the freestanding bill yesterday, we already have 28 of our colleagues who have become cosponsors. Additionally, we expect many more of our colleagues will be added as cosponsors to the bill and will also want to be  added as cosponsors to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Briefly, I wish to share my time with the Senator from Washington, who has shown great leadership on this issue. The amendment we are proposing deals with renewables. We know this country has an energy problem. We are too dependent on foreign sources of energy. Too much of our energy byproducts are polluting the environment, and there are concerns about climate change around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this amendment addresses both of those concerns, as well as being a stimulant to the economy. There are over 100,000 jobs that we protected with this amendment. We are talking about solar power, geothermal, wind energy and biomass.  There are many different renewables that are going to help within this amendment. Additionally, at a time when our country is at war in places where we are spending over $100 per barrel of oil, we are spending hundreds  of billions of dollars from our economy to support people who are not necessarily friendly to the United States. It is very important that we as a Senate, act now on this amendment in order to help the United States become less dependent on foreign sources of energy as well as clean up our environment. It is a national security concern, it is an economic concern, and it is an environmental concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased to introduce this amendment today so we can vote on it next week. I think it is very critical that this be part of the package, and that is why it needs to be done as soon as possible. Some may ask why there is such an urgency. Well, because a lot of this type of energy production takes a long time to develop. We do not have a lot of time to set the financing of these projects. We have been told by a lot of industries that if there isn't stability, a lot of these industries  are going to go away. We need to be encouraging renewable energy development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield a couple of minutes to my friend, the Senator from Washington, who is the lead sponsor of the bill we introduced yesterday.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Washington.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="NOT VOTING--21">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding me some of his time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been a big priority on this side of the aisle, to get clean energy tax credits so we can continue to stimulate investment in wind and solar and energy efficiency, and a variety of others--fuel cells, biomass, geothermal, and the list goes on and on. This is the fourth time we have tried to get to this legislation. Three other times we have come within one vote, so we are here today with more bipartisan support for a proposed solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues and the chairman of the Finance Committee have worked very hard on this legislation in general, on the concept of trying to push forward these tax credits, but we are at a critical point. In fact, I have said to my colleagues that Rome is burning; that is, we are at the precipice now of projects actually getting canceled. Having been in business, I know what it is like to have your first quarter earnings report and then have to show some forward advancement to your investors about  your projects. That is where we are. And because we aren't giving certainty in the Tax Code to these investors, they are going to start canceling projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we cannot wait another month, another 2 months to get about this tax. If we want to give certainty to the markets to continue to invest in alternative energy to take some of the pressure off of the rising cost of energy, now is the time to act. So I hope my colleagues will think about the bipartisan nature of the amendment. We have failed three times and have come one vote short to try to help our own economies in our States and in our country by saving this investment cycle. Give the predictability  so we can keep 100,000 jobs working, so we can get renewable energy produced and invested in during 2008, and so we can have the production of CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2-reducing energy supply and get that going now. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could say to my colleagues that we are almost at a point where the United States is so far behind what other countries are doing that we are not even going to be able to claim we are leading in this area if we do not get about the task. So if the votes are here, let's start voting to say renewable energy and its ability to stimulate the economy is a priority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe the amendment I offer on behalf of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and myself would improve the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I listened to them talking, their concern is for emerging technologies, for businesses that are trying to develop emerging technologies to have time to plan, and so they offer a 1-year extension of the production tax credit, which gives a 1 cent per kilowatt hour tax credit to most emerging technologies producing electricity for commercial sales. Some renewable electricity sources receive a larger 2 cents per kilowatt hour credit. I would propose, along with Senator Kyl, that we make  it a 2-year extension for emerging technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way we would pay for that so it would not be any more expensive than the proposal they have offered is to do with wind what we have already done with solar: take it off the list of 2-cent-per-kilowatt-hour technologies and put it on the 1-cent list. In other words, we would be creating a 2-year extension of the production tax credit for renewable technologies. We would be treating wind the same way we treat open-loop biomass, small irrigation power, landfill gas, trash combustion, qualified  hydropower, and wave and tidal facilities. They all would receive 1 cent per kilowatt hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it makes much more common sense today, if we want to encourage emerging technologies, to treat them the same, especially because wind has had a preferential treatment since 1992. What has happened, Mr. President, is wind has gobbled up most of the money that has been spent through the production tax credit, and very little has gone to any of the other technologies. The taxpayer has spent an enormous amount of money to build large wind turbines in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, we are committed to spending another $11.5 billion over the next 10 years for wind power alone, even though wind power produces less than 1 percent of all of our electricity and less than 3 percent of our clean electricity. Nuclear power produces nearly 70 percent of our clean electricity; that is, no nitrogen, no sulfur, no mercury, and no carbon for those concerned about climate change. If we were subsidizing nuclear power at the same rate we subsidize  wind power for clean energy, we would be spending $300 billion or $400 billion over the next 10 years for nuclear power. So wind has been gobbling up the available money for renewable energies, and making it difficult to identify appropriate offsets to pay for long-term extensions of this renewable electricity tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have spent an extraordinary amount of money on wind. Wind has already proven that where the wind blows, it works. It is competitive. And where it does not blow, it is not competitive. In the Southeastern United States, for example, there is one wind farm. Because of the generous wind subsidies, this wind farm on the top of a lovely mountain, Buffalo Mountain in Tennessee, last August, in the middle of a drought when we were all sweating and turning up our air conditioners, was operating 10  percent of the time. It makes no sense to pay big subsidies to people in Chicago to build wind farms in places where the wind doesn't blow. So what we are suggesting, Senator Kyl and I, is to let us take the available money and let us extend for 2 years the production tax credit, and let us let some of it go to open-loop biomass, more</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask my friends to seriously consider this not as an unfriendly amendment to renewable energy but as a friendly amendment. I have met with a lot of people who say we desperately need some certainty in business. Well, 2 years is twice as much certainty as 1 year, and there is no reason at this stage of development of energy why wind, which is well proven where the wind blows, and which has been subsidized so heavily since 1992, should continue to be subsidized at the expense of certainty in  our tax policy and at the expense of all of the other renewable energies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in summary, Mr. President--and I will have more to say about this next week--we believe the Alexander-Kyl amendment would improve the Ensign-Cantwell amendment by doubling the time the production tax credit is available to emerging renewable technologies. And the way we would pay for it is to treat wind the same way we treat open-loop biomass, small irrigation power, landfill gas, trash combustion, qualified hydropower, and wave and tidal power. They would be treated the same, and they would  be given a chance over 2 years to flourish rather than 1 year.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to address the underlying Ensign amendment. I think most Members of this body believe very strongly we need to be much more self-sufficient in the production of energy. We are way too reliant on OPEC. We have made several attempts in this Congress in the last several months to try to pass tax incentive provisions to accomplish that objective. They have not been successful, for various reasons. Some because they are paid for, and people don't like to pay  for this, and others because it was not paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, last February we passed an energy tax incentive package very similar to the Ensign package, which was not paid for, and that did not survive. So we are in a difficult position. I agree with the impetus of Senator Cantwell and Senator Ensign, but we also know the other body is probably not as friendly toward passing this because it is not paid for--not as friendly as this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope the President signs this package. I am not terribly sanguine that will happen, but nevertheless let's at least try to see if the other body will in fact adopt it. This is a housing bill; it is not an energy bill. We want to get a housing bill passed very quickly, and now that we have an energy provision in it, that is a bit problematic as to whether we are going to get the housing bill passed as it is, especially when the energy provisions are not paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Finance Committee has other options to pass this package. All Senators on the committee know what we have been working on. I am committed to getting these tax incentives passed this year. They are so important, so vitally important, for reasons everyone has mentioned. And, in fact, I am even more worried about it than probably some other Senators. I am as worried as the Senator from Washington about getting this passed. So I am committed to finding a way. If this approach is not successful,  I am committed to finding a way, to finding a successful approach so these energy provisions are in fact enacted into law this year.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I underscore the point the Senator from Montana has just made, and I say this in the same spirit in which he has expressed his remarks. This is a housing bill. We have 8,000 people a day in foreclosure--8,000. Just as we started this debate, 24,000 of our fellow citizens have lost their homes--24,000 people lost their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I agree energy independence is critically important. But this isn't a Christmas tree. There are ways of doing these energy bills in other matters. I was under the impression we wanted to get a housing bill out that could make a difference in people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we taking up matters that run the risk of tying this up for weeks on end in a conference with the House on matters they disagree with, that are not paid for, that may get a Presidential veto, and as a result we watch even more people lose their homes? It is a housing bill. It is a housing bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with all due respect to the authors of this amendment, I am going to oppose every one of them from here on out so we can get this bill done. We have more to do. This is not an all-inclusive bill. A lot more needs to be done. We are, frankly, not doing  enough for people in foreclosure, in my view, and I have made that speech for a year now on this matter. We have finally gotten to a point where we have come together in a bipartisan fashion to deal  with housing, and all of a sudden I find myself dealing with every other issue in creation because we haven't had bills that have moved along for whatever reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we shouldn't make people who are losing their homes, with our economy suffering, pay the price because we haven't dealt with these other issues. This is housing. The Senator from Montana is absolutely correct, and I intend to stand with him. We may lose. I hope we don't because we run the risk of having this one effort to make a difference on housing fall apart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all due respect to the authors of this legislation, and I agree with all of them on the substance, this is not the place and time for this issue. We need to deal with housing.</paragraph>

PENALTY-FREE WITHDRAWALS FROM RETIREMENT PLANS FOR FORECLOSURE RECOVERY RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MORTGAGES ON THEIR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not apply to any qualified foreclosure recovery distribution.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Limitations.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) IN GENERAL.--For purposes of this section, the aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual which may be treated as qualified foreclosure recovery distributions for any taxable year shall not exceed the lesser of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the individual's qualified mortgage expenditures for the taxable year, or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the excess (if any) of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) $25,000, over&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) the aggregate amounts treated as qualified foreclosure recovery distributions received by such individual for all prior taxable years.</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) TREATMENT OF PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS.--If a distribution to an individual would (without regard to paragraph (1)) be a qualified foreclosure recovery distribution, a plan shall not be treated as violating any requirement of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 merely because the plan treats such distribution as a qualified foreclosure recovery distribution, unless the aggregate amount of such distributions from all plans maintained by the employer (and any member of any controlled group which  includes the employer) to such individual exceeds $25,000.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) CONTROLLED GROUP.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the term "controlled group" means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of such Code.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Amount Distributed May Be Repaid.--</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, under current law, you can invade your retirement fund, your 401(k) fund, in order to purchase a home without paying the 10-percent penalty. What this amendment says is, if home ownership and keeping people in their homes is an important value in America, and they are about to have their home taken away because of this foreclosure crisis, then it seems to me we would want to amend the law to allow them to take money out of their retirement fund in order to  forestall the foreclosure and stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this amendment does. It allows someone to withdraw up to $25,000 from their retirement fund without paying the 10-percent penalty. That has to be used for the purpose of foreclosure prevention purposes; that is like paying on the principal or interest payments; that is like a refinancing or a mortgage modification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make sure people do not abuse this, we are limiting it to a 2-year period and we are additionally going to say, the money you bring out to help you so you do not go into foreclosure, if you put that money back into your retirement fund within 3 years, you are not going to have to pay the income tax on it. So it is a direct, tailored amendment to try to help people accomplish what the underlying goal is, which is to prevent foreclosures.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, during our travels back home to housing townhall forums during the course of this last year, we are all meeting more and more folks who are in very desperate straits, trying to keep their home. Minnesota ranks No. 2 in the number of subprime mortgages in for closure. Minnesota--who would have thought? That is the reality. It is across the country. I was in a forum at St. Cloud, in the central part of my State. I met a nurse named Terri Ross, a woman who had two jobs,  bought a house which was in need of repair. She had a pretty good mortgage, low interest rate, and wanted actually to quit one job to go back to school. She wanted to improve herself, improve her life, add to her education. She met with the mortgage broker. He said: Have I got a deal for you. We can get you a mortgage and it will be at a low rate. Don't worry about the fact--I am not sure she even knew it</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is a woman who worked all her life, put aside some money for retirement. What she did is she tapped into that and then she paid a penalty on it, trying to save her home. That was what she had. The problem is, across the Nation, people are now looking to use their retirement savings to save their homes and they get hit hard with a 10-percent early withdrawal penalty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was an article in USA Today. They ran a piece entitled "401(K)s Tapped to Save Homes." The article focuses on this problem. Americans are being slammed with taxes and penalties as they try to keep their homes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>These are the stories my friend from Florida and I have been exchanging. We have personal accounts that do stretch from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. These are the reasons we were called to take up this commonsense cause. We want to work on this legislation that Senator Nelson and I believe is one more way we can responsibly help homeowners, to temporarily waive this 10-percent penalty for withdrawals up to $25,000. Our amendment would also waive ordinary income  taxes, as the Senator from Florida indicated, if the homeowner pays back the withdrawal within 3 years of making it, so homeowners are provided with a strong incentive to make their retirement savings whole again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a silver bullet--I don't know if there is a silver bullet in terms of the crisis we are dealing with--but it helps those whom we want to help, homeowners who are in big trouble. In doing so, this temporary relief can prevent an unnecessary foreclosure from happening, one which hurts not only the family but hurts the entire community. When houses are foreclosed and vacant, it affects everyone in the surrounding area. It affects the neighborhoods. As a former mayor, I looked at neighborhoods  we built up in my time as mayor and I believe the same neighborhoods are being torn down by the crisis we are facing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is about homeowners helping themselves. While the 10-percent penalty is well intentioned and we do not want people to be using retirement savings during their working years, times such as this require us to recognize that sometimes such rules need to be flexible in order to serve a greater good. Both on a home ownership level and community level, I believe it makes sense to enable those who can to keep their homes. Ultimately it is up to the homeowner to decide whether it makes financial  sense to turn to their retirement savings to keep their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At least for those who decide to do so, we should not penalize them for trying to keep a roof over their heads and wanting to remain part of the community they have called home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense and much needed relief.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>401(K)s Tapped To Save Homes</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Christine Dugas)</narrative>
  <narrative>Struggling to save their homes from foreclosure, more Americans are raiding their 401(k) retirement accounts to pay their bills--and getting slammed with taxes and penalties in the process, according to retirement plan administrators.</narrative>
  <narrative>Rather than borrow money from their 401(k) accounts, which would have to be paid back, a growing number of beleaguered families have been cashing out, plan administrators say.</narrative>
  <narrative>This is happening even as borrowing from 401(k) accounts remains fairly flat. Fewer still are borrowing from 401(k) plans to buy homes. By contrast, new figures from plan administrators show the number of 401(k) "hardship withdrawals" is up in early 2008 compared with the same period last year.</narrative>
  <narrative>The main reason? The need to stave off foreclosure or eviction.</narrative>
  <narrative>Consider Tamara Campbell, who raided her 401(k) after her husband was laid off from his job as an occupational technician, and they  fell behind on their mortgage for several months. "If I hadn't done that, we would have been foreclosed on last year," says Campbell, who lives in a Denver suburb.</narrative>
  <narrative>Such hardship withdrawals began rising last year and, by January this year, had exceeded January 2007 levels. During the first month of the year, as the economic slowdown tightened pressure on mortgage holders, hardship withdrawals rose 23 percent at plans that Merrill Lynch (MER) administers compared with the same period in 2007, says Kevin Crain, managing director of the Merrill Lynch Retirement Group.</narrative>
  <narrative>The 401(k) withdrawals are rising mainly because people such as Campbell and her husband want to save their homes. Merrill Lynch found that the primary reason for the rise in hardship withdrawals was to prevent foreclosure or eviction, based on its sampling of applications filed in January.</narrative>
  <narrative>Likewise, in the first month of the year, compared with January 2007, Great-West Retirement Services saw a 20 percent increase in hardship withdrawals to save a home. And Principal Financial (PFG) reports that in January it received 245 calls from participants who inquired about 401(k) withdrawals to prevent a foreclosure or eviction, up dramatically from 45 similar calls it received in January 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>For workers, the consequences can be severe. About 85 percent of employers bar employees from making 401(k) contributions for six months after taking a hardship withdrawal, says Pamela Hess, director of retirement research at Hewitt Associates (HEW). Worse, employees who pull money out of tax-deferred 401(k) plans before age 59 1/2  generally must pay a 10 percent penalty on top of the taxes owed.</narrative>
  <narrative>A 401(k) loan imposes no such punishment. "But let's face it: If your problem is paying bills, and if you take out a loan, then you just add another bill to pay," says Nevin Adams of PlanSponsor.com, which monitors the 401(k) industry.</narrative>
  <narrative>As Campbell considers whether to make another withdrawal, she notes, "It's not the kind of thing you want to use your 401(k) for. And if I keep doing this, I'm not going to have any retirement savings."</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to close with a couple of sentences. As the chairman of the Banking Committee can so well instruct us, for most Americans, their home is their most valuable asset. We ought to be adopting policy, through enacting law, that allows them to be able to stay in their own home and to use every tool available to stay in that home.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Connecticut.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleague from Florida and the Senator from Minnesota for their work on this effort, having been involved years ago in the creation of Individual Retirement Accounts going back to the early 1980s, recognizing the value of encouraging people to set aside hard-earned income for retirement, for health care, for education as the motivation. Let me mention one concern I have while both Senators are on the floor, and I don't question at all the motivations  behind it. There is nothing in this amendment that would require a writedown. What we are trying to do is get the lenders to write down the size of these mortgages, to work out different arrangements so the borrower could afford the mortgage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What concerns me here is, while we are using this retirement income or these savings accounts to help meet these obligations, there is no commensurate responsibility on the part of the lender to try to reduce the cost. At the end of 2 years you may end up at exactly the same level. The money goes into the pockets of the lender, but at the end of the 2 years we are still faced with the size mortgage we had before, and the homeowner is in the same position they are in today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't have any quick idea here for you to tie this together to see if we can't incentivize that lender on that mortgage to also write down the cost of part of that or to restructure it in a way so that person facing foreclosure would be able to handle this. These moneys would be of tremendous help to them. But if you don't do anything about the size of the mortgage or conditions of it, all you have done is kicked the can down the road for 2 years and then also watch that retirement income get  exhausted. You can put it back in, but it seems to be defeating the very purpose of trying to get workouts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We started a year ago with the stakeholders and set up a set of principles for writedowns. Unfortunately, according to Moody's, only 1 percent of the lending institutions have done that in a year--tragically, in my view. We would be in a very different position had they done otherwise. So I am very suspicious about their willingness to do this, and merely providing additional resources to them coming out of people's hard-earned money, although you have a good idea putting money back in. I would  like to find a way to incentivize the lender so the people can use these resources to stay in the home. That is merely an idea to consider in the next couple of days as we go forward.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, frankly, I think this is a good discussion. There is merit for both, for those who want to amend the law so IRAs can be used to help people finance their homes, but I also think the Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee, makes a very good point. We don't want to let the lenders off the hook either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From a tax perspective, we in the Finance Committee believe--I can speak for myself anyway--that the purpose of this amendment is close enough to the nature of the purpose of the IRAs and the savings vehicles in the first place to warrant an exception that will last for 2 years because, after all, a home is pretty close to retirement. People should be saving for retirement in these retirement programs. If saving their home means dipping into their retirement savings, then I think that would be  appropriate, as to avoiding the 10-percent penalty. Also it is in effect for only 2 years, so from a tax perspective I think it is appropriate. However, I think the chairman of the banking committees makes an excellent point and I would join with the Senator to see if he can find some way to incentivize lenders to do what they should be doing, at least with respect to the principal on a lot of these mortgage loans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield, I also understand the concern raised by the chairman of the Banking Committee. I will be pleased to work with the chairman and my colleagues. I ask the chairman of the Finance Committee, I think one of the things he did address, a piece of issue, had to do with the tax consequences. If a mortgage was $150,000 and it was taken down to $100,000 by agreement, in the past that $50,000 was a taxable gain. I believe recently--again, this little piece--we took  that building block and said: Hey, if you knock it down to $100,000, that $50,000 is no longer a taxable gain; is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>All these pieces fit together. Again, there is no silver bullet at the end, but if we can come closer to addressing the full range of concerns, I think that would be positive. I think we already moved, with the leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee, to address that one piece. This is another piece. It is your home, your future, and clearly there is more work to be done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. Earlier, when the Senator from Minnesota talked about silver bullets I was smiling because it is my view there are never silver bullets. It is always a major effort to find lots of different pieces, different steps to address the difficulties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The occupant of the chair might remember this. There is a famous journalist, H.L. Mencken, of Baltimore, who said: For every complicated problem there is a simple solution--and it doesn't work.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak to the amendment of the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, regarding renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As much as I appreciate the fact, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, that this is a housing bill and there is a mortgage crisis out there that needs to be addressed, I would also argue, first of all, that, this being the Senate, we oftentimes consider amendments to bills that are not necessarily related to the underlying base bill, and secondly, that there probably is not an issue that impacts the folks I represent in South Dakota any more than does the high cost of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, granted, as you travel across the country--and this is true in my State, as I think it is in every State--people are following closely what is happening with the subprime mortgage crisis, and the Senate and the Congress are reacting to that with the legislation that is currently on the floor. But if you look at it in the context of the broader economy and what is impacting the pocketbooks of Americans every single day--and certainly of South Dakotans--there is no question that high energy  prices are impacting the lives of everyone I represent in South Dakota. We are a very energy-dependent State, and we travel long distances; we are a farm economy, so those inputs are very important to our economic well-being. We are a cold-weather State, and so electricity is in very high demand, both during the cold-weather season but also during the hot-weather season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me that if we are going to address the economic issues that affect this country right now, we cannot do that without taking a hard look at what we can do to make energy more affordable to people in this country. So I would argue to my colleagues who have made the point that this is, in fact, a housing bill that, notwithstanding that is the basic focus of this bill, when we look at addressing the economy, I think in the broader context this is what this whole discussion is about: how  can we bring relief to hard-working people who are struggling with the economic pains created by the housing crisis, by high energy prices, by high health care costs. Those are all factors that impact the pocketbooks of everyday Americans. So I think the discussion of this renewable energy extender amendment is perfectly appropriate in the context of this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say, with respect to the Senator from Montana, who has worked very hard, along with the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, on an energy package that would extend many of the tax incentives that are in place for renewable energy, we have had that legislation now on the floor of the Senate several different times and have been unable to reach that magic 60-vote threshold that is necessary to end a filibuster and to move forward with the legislation. So I would argue that every  opportunity we have, we need to move forward with this debate about energy and what we are going to do to lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy to make energy more affordable to more Americans. So I think it fits perfectly within the context of this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say, with regard to some of the extenders that will impact those that relate to energy production in my part of the world, I am particularly interested in the wind energy production tax credit, the 2-cent-per-kilowatt credit that applies to wind, and I have talked to investors who are looking at wind energy projects across this country and who are prepared to invest capital to build wind energy production but cannot deal with the uncertainty that exists with regard to Federal policy.  The wind energy production tax credit expires at the end of this year, and if we do not do something in the very near future, those who are looking at making investments--that investment capital is going to dry up. We cannot afford to have that happen at a time when we have an increasing and growing demand for energy across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are trying to look at the whole issue of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon emissions and find new renewable forms of energy that will help address our energy needs in a clean, environmentally friendly way. We cannot afford to allow these tax incentives for renewable energy production to lapse at the very time that there is investment sitting there on the sidelines waiting to invest in wind energy production and solar energy production, but with the lack of certainty that exists today because  of the pending expiration of these production tax credits, that investment very well could end up staying on the sidelines and not be made. That would be a very tragic outcome, I would argue, for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would hope that every opportunity we have here in the Senate--and frankly there will not be that many opportunities, regrettably, this year on legislation that actually is going to pass here in the Senate to which to attach these types of amendments. The Senator from Montana has said there will be a tax extender bill moving later. I hope he  is right. I hope we have a window down the road to get addressed some of these tax measures that are expiring. But if, in fact, that does not happen or if it happens later in the year, sometime in the summer, we are going to miss a lot of opportunity, a lot of capital investment in wind energy and other types of renewable energy production that we otherwise would get if we had some certainty with regard to what the policy is going to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, as much as there are jurisdictional objections being raised by the Senator from Connecticut with regard to this bill being a housing bill, the Senator from Montana regarding the need to do this later on a piece of legislation that might be a tax bill moving through the Finance Committee and ultimately out to the floor, I would simply make the case to my colleagues that timing is important. Timing really is critical with respect to whether we are going to continue to have incentives  in place, economic incentives for investment in renewable energy. Frankly, based on the conversations I have had with those who are looking at making those types of capital investments in wind energy and other forms of renewable energy production, they are very concerned that Congress has yet to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would much rather see a multiyear extension of the production tax credit for wind, and some of the other renewable energy tax credits, than doing this for 1 year because I do not think that provides the long-term certainty that is necessary. But I would much rather have a 1-year extension than face the prospect of this production tax credit expiring at the end of this year and us not addressing it and seeing a whole lot of capital investment that otherwise would be made in these areas of production  stay on the sidelines and us continue to go down this path of increasing dependance on foreign sources of energy, growing demand for energy here in the United States, and a need to lessen the greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere and us doing nothing about that. So my fear is that if</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would simply say to my colleagues who are going to hear objections raised on procedural grounds about dealing with these production tax credits in the context of this particular bill that we need to look at the broader picture. We have an energy crisis in this country. We have those who want to invest in renewable energy products that would help address that, that would meet all of the goals I mentioned about clean energy, about lessening our dependence upon foreign energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, the argument that was made by my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, with regard to wind energy being more of a localized, regional issue, that is predominately true. But so is oil production. There are lots of parts of the country that do not have certain energy sources. Yet we all rely upon all of those energy sources for our energy needs in this country. We happen to have an abundance of wind in the upper Midwest which I think has been underutilized, but it has the  potential to meet the energy needs of people not just in South  Dakota or North Dakota or Nebraska or Iowa or Minnesota but all across the country. We need to be making the investments in those types of energy sources, and we need to have the policies in place that would create the economic incentives for that to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that in spite of the objections that will be raised on some procedural grounds to moving forward, that absent action to date and having seen in the past--looking historically at what has happened to this wind energy production tax credit over time, since 1992 when it was originally enacted, every time it comes to where it is about to expire or does expire--you will see this peak investment when it is in place. When it comes to where it is running out, the investment falls off, tails off;  it expires, gets put back in place, and it takes off again. We need to even that out so we don't have these peaks and valleys, that we have consistent policies in place that will provide the certainty and the necessary incentives for those who want to invest in these types of energy sources to be able to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we will pass the Ensign amendment and put it on this bill. The objection has been raised that this could derail the housing bill. Frankly, the House has voted not on one occasion but on several occasions already for these very same renewable energy tax credits, and I suspect that they would welcome the opportunity to have that vote again in the House of Representatives. I hope it will be part of this package because it does address the fundamental issue when it comes to our broader  economy; that is, the high cost of energy that is plaguing and harming and impacting the pocketbooks of every single American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, when we have this vote, which I assume will be early next week, to vote yes for the Ensign amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is a very important amendment because we are all here because we are concerned about the crisis that exists in the mortgage industry and certainly in home ownership, but, more importantly, we want to prevent it from happening again. We want to make sure we are providing information to home buyers and others, counseling them in a way that really makes a difference. The amendment I am offering today will encourage our employers to provide  group legal services benefits with an emphasis on real estate counseling for their employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Group legal services plans have been around since the 1970s and are intended to do exactly what the Center for Responsible Lending says should be one of our very top priorities in this effort to deal with the housing crisis. We should be encouraging and incentivizing preventative legal services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make sure my colleagues understand how important this benefit is for our Nation's employees, particularly employees in rural areas and low-income areas where access to lawyers might be scarce. We should be giving the average American homeowner access to legal advice so that she or he can feel confident in the mortgages they are getting into and so that when, God forbid, things do go wrong, they can receive advice about what their rights and responsibilities are in dealing with foreclosures  and what options are available to them in dealing with this crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 120 of the Internal Revenue Code has lapsed. That section of the code was intended to provide a tax incentive so that our employers would offer group legal services plans to their employees. Since it has lapsed, virtually no new group legal benefit plans have been created and many employers are dropping those that do exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be encouraging these plans because they provide our working Americans with access to the legal advice they need, that they deserve, and that they often cannot access. Those legal services would provide a review of mortgage documents, would work with lenders to modify the loans and would create forbearance agreements, would assist in the restructuring of loans, and would provide counsel in foreclosure litigation when that is needed. These are all complex transactions that require significant  legal counsel, and my amendment will help ensure that America's homeowners, particularly those who are hard-working American families, and those home buyers, can get that much needed advice. We have provided this advice and certainly these services, as I mentioned earlier, since the 1970s through this benefit where employers can actually pool their resources in providing this type of advice and service to their employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this important amendment. Many of us have worked on a separate bill, and we think this is absolutely an appropriate and a proper place to put this incentive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Senator Smith, Senator Kerry, Senator Stabenow, Senator Levin, Senator Schumer, and Senator Kennedy are all cosponsors of our amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent now to add Senator Snowe as a cosponsor, who is also a cosponsor of the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>I also want to say a very big thanks to all of the groups that have endorsed this amendment: the American Bar Association, the American Prepaid Legal Services Institute, the International Union, the UAW, the AFSCME, and the Laborers. All of these groups have recognized how important it is to be able to provide these legal services to hard-working American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Particularly at a time when they may be affected in their home ownership or in the difficulties and challenges they face in the problems that exist in the mortgage industry right now, this is a critical component of the assistance we can provide them. To have let it lapse and to see that it virtually no longer exists is something we can correct. I hope we will with this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time, and I also say a special thanks to my chairman, Chairman Baucus, and Ranking Member Grassley, who have worked with us on this issue, along with Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby, who have done such a tremendous job in organizing and putting together, in an expeditious way, the effort we have to address these issues that working families are facing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank them and their staff for working with us, and we look forward to being able to move our amendment. I hope my colleagues will join me in  support of such an important amendment, a vehicle as well as a component that we already know works because we have had it in this country for quite some time in providing legal services to working American families. We want to continue to see that happen.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the amendment Senator Snowe is offering with several other colleagues is an amendment that focuses on what we passed and maybe what we did not quite notice. The Finance Committee passed an important provision that would provide an additional $10 billion in mortgage revenue bonds for first-time home buyers and at-risk borrowers. This is something we have been trying to do, and we have had much leadership in the Senate on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under present law, however, mortgage revenue bonds are allocated with a small State set-aside. The $10 billion in the current package is allocated only based on State populations. As we know, the economic downturn and housing collapse do not necessarily correspond to the population of States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us who come from smaller States recognize that and also recognize the benefits that have been provided in the underlying law that exists in that small State set-aside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Snowe amendment adds enough additional bonds so large States will still receive their due under the allocation of the $10 billion by population, but small and rural States also receive their allocation based on a small State set-aside under the current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is an important point we have noticed in terms of what the underlying law does and has done effectively and making sure we incorporate that into what we do moving forward in the legislation we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment only costs about $134 million, but it means an awful lot for small and rural States in order to make sure they have equity in being able to access the resources their homeowners need and their States can provide through those revenue bonds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to support this fair and reasonable amendment which will be a good addition to the mortgage revenue bond provision in the underlying bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the support earlier today of an amendment that I, Senator Cochran, Senator Vitter, and Senator Wicker brought forward for the people of the gulf coast--thousands and thousands and thousands of homeowners, responsible homeowners, homeowners who did not exploit opportunities for fancy-dancy mortgages, homeowners who took just the regular standard mortgages, who had actually paid their mortgages off, and kept insurance their whole  life. Then, in 2005, two storms hit the gulf coast and literally wiped out the net worth--literally, a great deal of the net worth--of hundreds of thousands of families on the gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I continue to come to the Senate floor is because the Stafford Act, which would normally come, if you would, to the rescue of people in our country in this situation, is wholly inadequate for either the initial recovery or the long-term rebuilding. It is not just what Mary Landrieu says, the Senator from Louisiana. It is what Secretary Chertoff testified before our committee last week. I am going to submit his actual quote for the Record. It is what Chief Paulson  of FEMA said yesterday, testifying before the committee. It is what the inspector general of the Homeland Security Department said yesterday testifying before our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is my dilemma as a Senator from a State that has had an unprecedented disaster. I would have been happy to receive the Stafford Act and just make it work for us. But since it is not working for us, I am kind of inventing things as we go along, trying to take appropriate and responsible advantage of other bills that come along that actually might be appropriate for our situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am trying not to ask for too much but only what we need. But since the structure we have is not applicable, I have no choice. So I have been waiting for a year and a half to get a housing bill on the Senate floor so we could make some of these changes. I appreciate my colleagues being understanding and supportive, and everybody has been just terrific.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier this week, we have had some terrible situations in Detroit, in California, in Las Vegas, in Sacramento, thousands and thousands in San Bernardino, CA. But as I said, some of these homeowners could have gotten themselves in trouble. They might have done things they should not have done. I do not know. Maybe some people were victims of fraud. That will be worked out, I hope, through some of the legislation we are passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the reason I pull this chart up is to say that even in the worst area in the country right now for foreclosures, which is Detroit, Dearborn, MI, with 42,000 homes--these are official numbers--only 4.9 percent of the houses in this whole area are basically in foreclosure or for which there is a threatening pending foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I bring this contrast to show you that down on the gulf coast, those numbers are dwarfed by what Katrina and Rita and the subsequent levee breaks did to our homeowners. In St. Bernard Parish, almost 55 percent--not 4 percent, not 10 percent, not 20 percent but 54 percent of the homes in St. Bernard Parish--had damage exceeding 30,000. Some of these homes were only worth $50,000. Some were worth $350,000. But they are basically completely damaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the sheriff and the parish president told me that there were only five homes undamaged in the whole parish after Katrina and Rita--after those waters went down--5 out of the 67,000 people who live in this parish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Cameron Parish, almost 50 percent of their households have had completely devastating damage to their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, if you can, picture a place that does not have just a spattering of houses and weeds and emptiness but places that have blocks and blocks and miles and miles of homes that are empty and gutted with the windows and doors open and the families gone. People are struggling to come back with a very inadequate Federal framework right now to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know we have sent down a lot of community development block grant money. After a lot of contortions that everybody went through, we finally crafted a plan to give each of these homeowners, if they qualified--they had to prove they owned the land; they had to prove they paid taxes; they had to prove they were actually the right homeowner--we gave them a grant, no more than $150,000. The average is about $60,000 for Mississippi and Louisiana. Our plans are similar but not the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you can imagine the problem with a family who owned their house outright, they had no mortgage. It was worth $350,000 or $400,000 or $500,000, and the most grant they could possibly get is $150,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we are far away from trying to make people whole. Why should we try to make them whole? Again, it is nothing they did. They did not cause the hurricane. Some of them did not even live in floodplains. Some of the families did not have flood insurance because they were told by their mortgage holder and their bankers they did not need it. They were told by the Federal Government they did not need it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my amendment is an attempt to help these homeowners by not adding a penny to the underlying bill, which is a wonderful thing--that we do not have to add any money to the underlying bill because I know we are trying to keep the cost of all this down. But all my amendment would do would be to allow there to be a third reason that bonds could be issued at the State level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the underlying bill, the first reason, which is a good reason, is to allow first-time home buyers to buy some of the homes that have been foreclosed on that are sitting empty in neighborhoods. So what a good way to kind of get these homes back in circulation, to allow first-time home buyers with limited incomes--it is $65,000 in my State. I am not sure what it is in everybody else's State, but that would be a lot of families with teachers, firefighters, nurses, et cetera. They are not very  wealthy but not poor middle-class families. These families could come in and buy some of these homes. That is a great idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I used to be the State treasurer. I issued these bonds. It works. It is a happy thing when people can buy a home. The underlying bill also allows these bonds to be issued to build more multifamily dwellings. This is a desperate need in Louisiana because while we spend a lot of time talking about our homeowners who have lost homes, we had over 60 percent of the population in New Orleans, maybe between 50 and 60 percent who were not even homeowners. They were renters. Some of them were very wealthy  renters. They chose to live in nice places, but a lot of the people in New Orleans--my hometown--were poor, and they could not afford a home, so they were renting. Their places have been destroyed, and we now have a growing homeless population of historic proportions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the provision in the underlying bill that gives the opportunity to issue bonds to build multifamily dwellings is great. We can build for the elderly, who really need affordable housing in the country. I also believe the underlying provision allows for the building of places, rentals for the disabled, which is also a growing need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what my amendment simply says is, there will be a third option for these bonds, and it will help to refinance homes that have been destroyed along the gulf coast in basically the storms of 2005. That is what the current amendment says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me say that I am very open to modify my amendment, if the leadership wants to do that, to allow the use of these bonds to go to basically any home that was destroyed by a disaster in the whole country. I think it would be a very good use of these bonds because, as I said, there is not a lot of help outside of just general insurance that helps people to rebuild. If people have insurance, fine; they can rebuild their home from insurance proceeds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But many people who had their houses destroyed by tornadoes or flash floods or hurricanes or earthquakes were not required to have insurance by the current law, and if they already paid off their mortgage, even if they were required to have insurance, they weren't required to after they paid off their mortgage; so a disaster hits and there is no way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a grant. This is not a giveaway. It is an opportunity to provide mortgage lending for people who may want to buy some of these homes that have been destroyed. They are not foreclosed homes; they were destroyed and owned basically now by, in our case, Government entities that are trying to recirculate these properties back into the housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is basically what my amendment does. I hope we will have an opportunity, of course, as the day goes on, to maybe speak about it more or to have a vote on it next week, whenever the Senate decides to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Connecticut. As I was saying before he came in, the amendment I am offering now adds no cost to the underlying bill. It takes the mortgage provision piece and makes it applicable for trying to help with homes that were destroyed in a disaster. Right now, we are trying to help with homes that were destroyed, if you will, by a foreclosure situation. We are also hoping to build multifamily housing, which is great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All we are asking for with this amendment is to basically add a third voluntary--not mandatory but voluntary on the part of the States if they want to include disaster, without adding any additional expense to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I hope we will take up this amendment whenever we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, before the Senator from Louisiana leaves, first of all, let me commend her generally. All of us at one time or another have faced natural disasters in our State, but I can't recall anything, at least in recent memory, that would compare to what the Gulf State have suffered and particularly what the State of Louisiana has suffered. I know some may say: Well, every time there is a bill up, that Senator from Louisiana has an amendment to help her folks in Louisiana. That  is how it ought to be. They are very fortunate indeed to have a fighter such as Mary Landrieu in their corner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As she said, this wasn't any disaster. This was devastating. For those of us who have been there, as I was, and as one who has been there on several occasions since then, it still is stunning to me to go down and see the devastation still exists. In most disasters,  within weeks or months after the occurrence, it is amazing how recuperative areas are; however, despite the Herculean efforts of many in her State and others, the devastation still persists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, those who have lost their homes suffer the most devastating impact of all, in many ways, because that is the center of a neighborhood, it represents the ability of a family to survive and stay together. All the elements and qualities we like to attribute to being an American family are associated with our homes. The fact that so many have been destroyed as a result of these disasters is something all of us are mindful of, and if we are not, the Senator from Louisiana reminds us of  it on a daily basis. We thank her for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are certainly going to do everything we can to accommodate and be supportive of this effort. As she points out, it doesn't expand the program financially. It operates within the financial constraints as the amendment has been crafted. Right now it is focused on the Gulf States, those areas that were adversely affected. My inclination is to keep it that way. That is not to suggest other States may not have had similar occurrences, but I think because of the uniqueness of what happened there,  we need to recognize that in this effort. I would be a little uneasy about expanding it. Not that that is without merit, but I think particularly in this case, with this one occasion we are talking about a particular compelling case which has been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So once again, I thank her for fighting on behalf of our fellow American citizens who happen to be her specific constituents. We thank her for it. Over this weekend, we will take a look at it, and if there are any questions we have about it, I will get back to her, but I will be urging Senator Shelby and others to be supportive of this idea.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, I wish to commend Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for their work on this legislation. In particular, I wish to congratulate them on the provisions already in the bill to help our servicemembers and veterans. I also wish to thank Senator Akaka, the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Senator Burr, the ranking member, and their staffs, for helping to clear this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I am offering today will provide another piece of needed help to disabled veterans trying to stay in their homes. This amendment increases funding for a VA grant program that assists disabled veterans needing to adapt their homes to accommodate their disabilities. As the Presiding Officer knows, many thousands of soldiers, coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan as amputees, who are blind and who have a number of disabilities, and this amendment attempts to address some of those problems  by helping them adapt their homes so they can live in those homes with their disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is supported by some of our Nation's largest veterans organizations, including the VFW, the DAV, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Vietnam Veterans of America. It is also important to note the policy changes we are advocating are contained in the independent budget, the document authored every year by many of the same organizations. It is also a policy that has the unanimous support of the majority members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, which endorsed this  policy change in the 2007 and 2008 Views and Estimates letter to the Budget Committee; in other words, this policy in this amendment has broad support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans with certain severe service-connected disabilities are entitled to what are known as specially adapted housing grants of up to $50,000. Veterans with service-connected blindness only or with loss of use of both upper extremities may receive a grant of up to $10,000. The authors of the independent budget note increases in these amendments have been sporadic, despite the increases in real estate costs. In particular, veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are finding the current  VA program does not cover the cost of adapting their homes to accommodate wheelchairs or loss of vision, to create physical therapy space or other needed changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment increases the specialty adaptive housing grant to provide $10,000 in additional benefits for those veterans eligible for the $50,000 grant and $2,000 in additional benefits for those veterans eligible for the current $10,000 grant. So we are raising the cap on each program to $60,000 and $12,000, respectively. According to CBO, for fiscal year 2009, this amendment would cost about $6 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate is now debating an important piece of legislation to try to bring relief to so many of the middle-income Americans who are struggling to keep their heads above water in today's economy and housing crisis. I think, given the context of this bill, certainly we can reach out to disabled veterans to adapt their homes so they can try to live as full lives as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to again commend Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, and the Banking Committee for the proveteran, proservicemember provisions already in this legislation, and I ask that my colleagues support this small additional benefit. I ask for my colleagues' support on this amendment, and if it is appropriate, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me commend my fellow New Englander for this idea. You wonder how something such as this persisted as long as it did. I wish to commend our colleague for discovering it and finding it out. Senator Shelby is not here this afternoon, but his staff is around, and we have been talking with them. I think this will overwhelmingly be accepted. This should not require a recorded vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was telling the staff I am one of six children. My oldest sister Carolyn was born legally blind. When I arrived at the House of Representatives in the mid-1970s, I remember as a freshman I discovered you couldn't be a foreign service officer if you were legally blind. We managed to change those regulations. How silly a rule it was. Unrelated or related, I guess, to some degree here, but I thank my colleague from Vermont for raising this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate his kind comments about Senator Akaka. Senator Kerry and Senator Coleman offered some ideas as well on the veterans housing issues also. I am told by Senator Shelby's staff he is very supportive of this  as well. This isn't a large amount. It may not be a banner headline for some, but the Senator from Vermont is going to make a difference in the lives of some families and some individuals. It may not be  thousands. Even if there are a few hundred, it makes a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So at a moment such as this, on a Friday afternoon, when most people have headed off for home, let the Record record and history record that the Senator from Vermont made a difference in the lives of a handful of people with this amendment. I thank him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who have worked so hard this week on the housing stimulus bill. I particularly want to commend my friend from Rhode Island--Senator Jack Reed--for his tireless work on simplifying mortgage disclosures so that mortgage applicants will have in plain English--not fine print or jargon--the most important terms of the loan including the maximum monthly payment possible. This provision was included in the bipartisan substitute amendment  and I congratulate Senator Reed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For months, as America has sunk deeper and deeper into economic distress, hard-working people all over this country have wondered what they are going to do to make ends meet--and why their Government wasn't doing more to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For families already strained by rising health care and gasoline costs, and with many struggling to care for an elderly parent or put a child through college, the latest economic downturn is fast becoming the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of Rhode Island, where affordable housing was already in scarce supply, thousands of families face foreclosure, eviction, and an uncertain future. For the 12-month period ending in December 2007, the foreclosure rate in Rhode Island increased by a staggering 238 percent. More than 12 percent of subprime loans in my State were in foreclosure in December 2007. The foreclosure rate among subprime loans in Rhode Island is 15 times higher than the prime loan foreclosure rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a crisis that strikes at the most vulnerable. As I talked to Rhode Islanders during the recent recess, I heard over and over again about the difficulty of making ends meet in this fragile economy. And as they watch things get worse, they wonder why our Government would do so much to keep the investment bank Bear Stearns from going under, but so little for them and their neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some in this city, and in this building, who believe that if we simply let the markets correct themselves, all will be well. I have great faith in market forces, and I've seen firsthand the power of American industry and American ingenuity to work great good in our country and our world. But we in Government should know by now that market forces need disciplined constraint, and that the American people deserve better than to see their homes swept away by a financial typhoon while Congress  stands idly by. They need our help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this week, after hard work and good-faith negotiations, Senators Dodd and Shelby reached a compromise on legislation to soften the blow of the residential real estate collapse. In addition to Senator Reed's disclosure provision, the bill now before us includes $4 billion in funding for community development block grants to assist States and municipalities in purchasing and rehabilitating homes that have been foreclosed upon, and $100 million for pre-foreclosure  counseling. It also includes Federal Housing Administration reform that will increase the availability of FHA-backed mortgages, offering an alternative to the subprime market for more middle- and lower-income families for whom buying a new home might otherwise be out of reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement is a strong start, but it failed to include a provision authored by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois that would permit bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of a primary residence mortgage. I was proud to cosponsor Senator Durbin's amendment, which included this provision, and was disappointed that the amendment lost a procedural vote yesterday. I plan to support my colleague from Illinois as he continues his efforts to enact this important change to the bankruptcy  code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, unlike most contracts, including mortgages on vacation homes and family farms, bankruptcy judges cannot currently modify the terms of the very contract most dear to families facing bankruptcy, their principal residence: the place they call home, where they raise their children, know their neighbors, and live their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, this provision would fix this glaring anomaly in section 1322(b)(2) of the bankruptcy code so that primary residence mortgages are treated like most other secured debts. Like any secured creditor, the mortgage holder would be entitled to adequate protection of his or her property interest during the chapter 13 case. The modification of the mortgage would be limited by market prices and rates and to a repayment term of no longer than 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the cost of foreclosures--which may average as high as $50,000 per incident--it would seem that this amendment to the bankruptcy code would benefit all parties to a mortgage. Passing this measure could help more than 600,000 families facing bankruptcy stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to consider this housing stimulus package, we have an opportunity to help millions of families weather this crisis and get their lives back on track. I will continue to fight for meaningful relief for middle-class families threatened with the loss of their homes.</paragraph>
