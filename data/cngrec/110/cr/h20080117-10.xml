    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, congratulations to Coach Ray Reitz and the Jeannette Jayhawks football team, who are the Class AA football champions, beating every team they played this year by more than 20 points. Senior quarterback Terrell Pryor, who is also USA Today's Offensive Player of the Year, scored five of the seven touchdowns in their 49-21 win. He is the first player in State history to eclipse both 4,000 yards rushing and 4,000 yards passing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Jeannette is champions in the classroom as well, with McKee Elementary being a Blue Ribbon school, and all their schools receiving the Keystone Achievement Recognition this year, and the school district getting the bronze medal. Great accomplishment for a small school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congrats to the Jayhawks for excellence in the classroom and on the field.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
