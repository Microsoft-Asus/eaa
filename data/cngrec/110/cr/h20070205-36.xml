    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in the Senate right now, there is a piece of nonbinding legislation that disapproves of the troop surge or the Bush Doctrine. Now, it is nonbinding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I find offensive, when we have troops on the ground in combat, is you have a bunch of self-proclaimed moralist Senators saying that we should not do this, and so what they want is a nonbinding legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, if they really feel like this idea is a bad idea and it imperils Americans, then they should follow their conviction and introduce real legislation. After all, they do carry the impact of changing the law since they are the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is silly to have an extracurricular, intramural exercise. They should bring real legislation to the floor. I am hoping that Members of the House will do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of critics of the war in the House. Well, it is time to tone down the rhetoric and beef up the legislation, whether you want immediate withdrawal, phased-down withdrawal, a surge, maybe a bigger surge than the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be having real conversations in Washington. The election is over.</paragraph>
