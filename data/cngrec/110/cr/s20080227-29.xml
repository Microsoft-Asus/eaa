  <narrative>GREEN CHEMISTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (Senate - February 27, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1267">S1267</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to join my friend Senator Snowe and our colleagues Senator Pryor, Senator Collins, and Senator Kerry in introducing the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act. This legislation is a bipartisan effort to promote the efforts of some of the most brilliant minds in academia, government, and industry to both reduce the environmental impacts of common chemical processes and to foster the development of a new generation  of environmentally responsible chemical products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My fellow cosponsors and I seek to help the chemical industry reduce its use and production of hazardous substances and the overall effect on the environment of the business of chemistry. As it was in the past when Senator Snowe and I previously introduced legislation to promote "Green Chemistry," this legislation is supported by the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries and academic institutions because it is designed to hasten the attainment of a goal we all share:  making the production of the chemical products we need in ways not detrimental to the environment using engineering processes that save both money and the planet. The products and engineering processes we believe will be developed will produce benefits across the entire economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we call "green chemistry" is nothing more than what every industry in the United States should strive to be. Chemical companies employing green chemistry techniques will challenge their best scientists, engineers, and product developers to make new products that are better suited to the task for which they are created than the products they will replace using state-of-the-art manufacturing that minimizes or completely eliminates both the use of environmentally unsustainable substances  as inputs or results in environmentally unsustainable substances as byproducts. Our purpose in introducing this legislation is to make certain that the nascent green technology revolution does not bypass the chemical industry by providing significant and ongoing support for green chemistry research, development, demonstration, education, and technology transfer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When enacted, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act will create a Federal Interagency Working Group--made up of representatives from the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency--to fund and oversee research through merit-based grants to universities, industry, and nonprofit organizations to promote the development and adoption of green chemistry processes and products. Further,  the Interagency Working Group will help expand education, training in, and the flow of information about sustainable chemical engineering, including development of green chemistry curricula for undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, Federal resources in funding and technical expertise will seek to identify barriers to the commercialization of the products of a rejuvenated, more environmentally responsible domestic chemical industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are challenging times for the domestic chemical industry. High  prices for necessary feedstocks and transportation to customers, along with all the other hurdles that must be overcome in the global economy, have put this industry, which began here and which supplied vital products to customers the world over, at risk of being another industry the United States could lose to our foreign trading competitors. However, this industry meets challenges  every day. This legislation will allow American chemical companies to once again demonstrate a passion for excellence, safety, and innovation that will be a source of envy around the world and create a generation's worth of good-paying jobs that States like West Virginia can build an economy around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I call on my colleagues to take up and pass the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act.</paragraph>
