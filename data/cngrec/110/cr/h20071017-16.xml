    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of an American hero, retired Army Reserve Brigadier General Felix Sparks, who recently passed away at the age of 90. Felix Sparks lived a remarkable life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Texas native raised in Arizona, he answered our Nation's call to duty in 1940 with his service in the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Division during the Second World War. He fought in the battle of Reipertswiller, the Battle at the Caves of Anzio and also for the liberation of 30,000 prisoners in the Dachau concentration camp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his service, he was awarded a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts after being severely wounded on the battlefield. He continued his service in the National Guard until his retirement as a brigadier general in 1977.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his return from the war, Felix and his wife settled in Colorado. Felix went on to become the youngest Supreme Court Justice in Colorado's history at 38 years of age. An expert in water law, he also served for over two decades as the director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, Felix Sparks was an extraordinary public servant who embodied the best of America.</paragraph>
