    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, could the Chair tell me how many Members rose to request the recorded vote and the total number of Members present in the House upon which the Chair made his decision?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> It's up to the Chair. And let me tell you this: The vote will show that the approval would be approved by the House, as it has been.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, does not the Constitution require that in order to get a yea and nay vote there has to be one-sixth of the Members present requesting a yea and nay vote?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> One-fifth.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SENSENBRENNER" of="">
    <paragraph>Excuse me, one-fifth.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The gentleman is correct.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SENSENBRENNER" of="">

  <chair> One-fifth of a quorum is required.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SENSENBRENNER" of="">
