    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to join in this body's hearty congratulations to our colleague from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, as the longest serving Republican Senator. The remarkable thing about TED STEVENS is not the number of years he has served but the amount of service he has put into those years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Founders did a unique thing when they created the Senate. They knew that democracy should both let the majority rule most of the time but also protect minority viewpoints from the tyranny of the majority. They created a House of Representatives based on proportional representation. Meanwhile, in the Senate, they gave every State, large and small, exactly two votes. They then went a step further, and created the Senate as a body that operates by consensus. The result is a place where one person  with a good idea can impact the entire body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TED STEVENS is a living embodiment of the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. He is precisely the kind of Senator they hoped for: forceful, persevering, principled and indefatigably devoted to his State's interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alaska is a unique State and Senator Stevens reflects its style and unlimited potential exceptionally. In every aspect, Alaska is a long, long way from Washington, DC, and its unusual bureaucratic culture. We all benefit from the independent, self-reliant spirit of Alaska that the Senator brings, reminding us of the pioneer heritage of the West. I am personally appreciative of the Senator's hospitality when visiting in his home State. I thought we had "wide open spaces" in Minnesota,  but Alaska's are certainly both wider and more open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When President Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Seward, finalized the purchase of Alaska, it was thought to be a folly. How blessed we all are as Americans to have its abundant wilderness and natural resources as part of our national experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have found that when people want to learn something really important, they prefer an example to an explanation. As I have tried to learn my way around this institution, Senator Stevens has been a role model, an example, and a friend. I thank him for his kindness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even more I thank him for his service which has made this Nation safer, stronger and freer for all. He makes his great State and all his colleagues proud to say they know TED STEVENS.</paragraph>
