    <paragraph>Madam President, on April 17, just over a week ago, I rose, along with the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, to ask unanimous consent that the Senate take up and adopt <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, which was reported unanimously by the Rules Committee on March 28. Senator Alexander objected on behalf of a Republican Senator. As a result, the bill remains in limbo. To this date, that Republican Senator has declined to come forward to say why the bill should not become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is such a simple, direct bill with respect to transparency. It is an idea whose time has long come. It is very hard for us to understand who could oppose this good government bill and what their reason for opposing it could be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After last week's roadblock halted passage, the minority leader's spokesman told the Washington Post:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators are now reviewing the bill in anticipation of legislative action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would hope that review is complete. We could now get down to business and today, by unanimous consent, just as we did in the Rules Committee, pass this bill, send it to the House, and have it become law. At our hearing on March 14 and our markup on March 28, it was clear there was no public opposition whatsoever to this bill. It is really time for the Senate to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is titled the "Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act." It is sponsored by Senators Feingold and Cochran and 33 additional Senators. It would simply require that the Senate campaign finance reports be filed electronically rather than in paper format, just as everyone else is doing now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, House candidates, Presidential candidates, political action committees, and party committees are all required to file electronically. And they do. But Senators, Senate candidates, authorized campaign committees, and the Democratic and Republican senatorial campaign committees are exempt. As a result, we have a cumbersome system in which paper copies of disclosure reports are filed with the Senate Office of Public Records, which scans them to make an electronic copy and sends the copy  to the FEC on a dedicated communications line. The FEC then prints the report and sends it to the vendor in Fredericksburg, VA, where the information is keyed in by hand and then transferred back to the FEC database at a cost of approximately $250,000 to the taxpayers. This is $250,000 which is needlessly spent to continue an archaic system. It is long past time to bring the Senate into the modern era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to let this bill go today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor to the author of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I certainly thank the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, once again for being so committed to getting this bill passed. It has been, as she said, over a week since we came to the floor to try to get the Senate to pass the Senate Campaign Parity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Tuesday, the senior Senator from Tennessee objected "on behalf of a Republican Senator." Now we have waited to hear from that Senator, whoever he or she is, about his or her concerns about the bill. So far, not a word. It would not take very long to review this bill. It is very simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, it seems as if the source of the objection is hoping never to be identified because a citizen effort to find out who the objector is, supported by a number of blogs from both the right and the left, has so far come up empty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a lot of discussion in the press and the blogs about whether the objection we heard last week constitutes one of those so-called secret holds, which have rightly come under attack in recent years. Well, someone anonymously blocked the bill from being passed last Tuesday, that person has made no effort to resolve his or her concerns with us, and the Republican leadership will not tell us who that person is. Now, that is a "secret hold," in my book. It is time for some sunshine  here. If someone has a problem with this bill, he or she should step forward and discuss it with us. I am hopeful that after a week to take a look at the bill, the objector will have realized how completely noncontroversial it is and will let it go through this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill simply puts Senate campaigns under the same obligations to file their reports electronically that House and Presidential campaigns have been under for years. There is simply no reason the information in Senate campaign finance reports should remain less accessible to the public than any other campaign finance report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senator from California said, we now have 37 bipartisan cosponsors, and not a single concern about the bill was heard in the Rules Committee. The bill passed the committee by a voice vote, and no one has come up to us with any concerns, even in this last week. So the time has come to get this done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I once again thank the Senator from California for her persistence. It is a pleasure to work with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership and for his continuing interests. Hopefully, this will pass today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that vein, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar item No. 96, <bill type="s" number="223">S. 223</bill>, a bill to require Senate candidates to file designated statements and reports in electronic form, and that the committee-reported amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill as amended be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action.</paragraph>
