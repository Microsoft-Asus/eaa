    <paragraph>Madam President, let me take this moment as in morning business to salute Senators BARBARA BOXER and INHOFE of Oklahoma for passage of the Water Resources Development Act. If I am not mistaken, it has been 6 years that we have been trying to do this--maybe longer--and this important infrastructure legislation is an example of bipartisan cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people from time to time ask why we spend so much time arguing on the floor of the Senate. I hope they paid close attention to the proceedings of the last week, when Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, on a bipartisan basis, managed to pass a critically important bill for the United States of America. I salute them. It is an important bill for my State, the Midwest, and the Nation.</paragraph>
