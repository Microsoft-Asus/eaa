  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - May 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4211">S4211</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader time, the Senate will resume consideration of the conference report to accompany the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act, <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>. There will be 90 minutes for debate on the conference report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might add in passing that Senators worked until about 11 o'clock last night on this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will vote on any motions relating to the conference report prior to a vote on its adoption. Senators should expect the first vote of the day to begin about 11:05, 11:10, depending on how long Senator McConnell and I take. Upon disposition of the conference report, we expect to begin the process of appointing conferees to the budget resolution conference. Senators should expect rollcall votes to occur throughout the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note that there is a 1 p.m. filing deadline for first-degree amendments to the collective bargaining legislation, <bill type="h" number="980">H.R. 980</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned last night, when we finish adoption of the conference report, it will be up to Senators Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad to determine how many motions will be filed to instruct conferees. Other Senators can do that, of course, but it would have to be through the two managers. There is a total of 10 hours on that. We would hope that time could be shortened significantly. We are going to finish that tonight, the appointing of conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken to Senator Dorgan. We have the media cross-ownership matter that he has proceeded forward with under a statute Senator Nickles and I passed in the early 1990s. The statutory time limit on that is 10 hours. Senator Dorgan told me last night that he would take 1 hour. I would hope others wouldn't take much more time than that. That being the case, there is an opportunity to finish that tonight. I hope that is the case. Otherwise, we would finish that tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, we have scheduled now a cloture vote on the collective bargaining matter we worked on this week. As I indicated last night, we are going to see if Senators Kennedy and Gregg can work something out on that, along with the comanager of the bill, Senator Enzi. If they can give us some way to proceed to complete that, maybe we can work out a unanimous consent that we wouldn't have to do the cloture vote. I think the ability to do that is somewhat slim, but I never  give up hope. It might be possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point being, we have a lot to do. We are going to work late tonight unless there is some agreement that shortens the time significantly on the appointing of conferees and the cross-ownership issue dealing with the Dorgan proposal. I think that is what we have ahead of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I am making sure we complete everything this week, the House is going to pass, sometime today, the supplemental. We have no votes on Monday. I would hope we could start maybe on that issue on Monday because we would like to do some other things next week. But that is a big issue to deal with. The House can jam things through, as we all know, because they have different rules than we do. But over here we have to follow our rules, which are not the  House  rules. So one of the first things we will do when we see what the House finally does, because we don't know yet, is I will sit down and talk to the Republican leader and find out if there is a way we can proceed to allow people to do what they think is necessary on the bill but at least</paragraph>
