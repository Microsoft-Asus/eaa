  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) is recognized for 60 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome my colleagues from Oregon who are in the Chamber with me tonight. Congressman DeFazio and Congresswoman DARLENE HOOLEY are here with me, and I know we will be joined by other members of the Northwest delegation to talk about a very, very important issue, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>, also known as County Payments, that in both this Congress and the last has been a strongly bipartisan  issue. The DeFazio-Walden legislation, <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>, a bill to reauthorize and fund the County Payments Program for 7 years to date enjoys the support of 114 cosponsors in this Congress. The exact same bill last Congress had 139 cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said in 13 of 18 one-minute floor speeches: the failure of Congress, either the last one or this one, to reauthorize the County Payments Program amounts to a breach of faith to more than 600 forested counties all across America and 4,400 school districts all across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to highlight a few of the impacts of the rural forested counties and school districts in America without these funds: severe cuts in funding for jail beds; sheriffs' patrols are being cut sometimes in half; criminal prosecutions and the pursuit of meth cooks, all of that being reduced; rural school districts foregoing overdue repairs; may not be able to buy textbooks, or face significant challenges busing kids to schools. It also means libraries will close in places  like Jackson County, Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to draw your attention to this poster here to my left. It is from a young lady, a fifth grader named Alice from Ashland, Oregon, who utilizes one of the 15 Jackson County libraries where she lives, and they are all scheduled to close in just a couple of months, in April, if we don't reauthorize and fund the Secure County Schools legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice has resolved to read all the "Hank the Cowdog" books, but she needs these libraries to stay open. She says: "Representative Walden, I live in Ashland and I go to Bellview School. I am in the fifth grade. I use our library a lot. We always use books on tape for car trips. My New Year's resolution is to read all the "Hank the Cowdog" books, and the library has them all. I need the library to stay open so I can finish my resolution. I also use a lot of books here for school reports.  Please help to keep our library system open. Sincerely, Alice."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alice is a fifth grader in Ashland, Oregon. She gets it. If Alice can get it, this Congress ought to be able to get it, and we ought to be able to keep the libraries open in Jackson County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of you in this Chamber and Americans all across the land will remember the heart-wrenching service for the Kim family in southern Oregon this winter, lost in the national forest, and the mountain climbers who perished on Mount Hood just 45 minutes from my home in Hood River. Both of these counties, both of the search and rescue operations that took place used funds out of the program that Congressman DeFazio and others and I are trying to reauthorize to help pay for the equipment  and for the search and rescue operations, to go on Federal land using county resources to look for these people who were lost, some of whom perished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These vital county services and rural school programs were once funded by timber receipts, but because of virtual elimination of the timber harvest on our Federal forests, Congress approved the county payments to develop forest health improvement projects on public lands and simultaneously stimulate job development in some of our rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This law has been a primary funding mechanism to provide rural schools with educational opportunities comparable to suburban and urban students. It has also restored programs for students in rural schools and prevented the closure of numerous isolated rural schools. It has allowed over 600 rural counties to address the severe road maintenance backlog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I get into that, though, I would like to show you total Pacific Northwest timber receipts. As you can see here, it has fluctuated over the years, but it has never been as low as it is today. There were big years of timber harvest, this one up, very large; but generally it has been in this framework, and you can see, really, since the 1990s it has just gone way down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has had a compact with these counties dating back to when Teddy Roosevelt was President and created the great forest reserves, setting aside huge swaths of land. Upwards to half of my district is under Federal management and control, and many of my colleagues and some of my counties it is upwards to 70, 75 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government believed in 1908 and again in 1938 that it had a responsibility to help these communities surrounded by Federal lands because these lands were not going to be on their tax base. That is what started this whole program. They used to share timber receipts. As you can see, timber harvests went down, the receipts went down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You say, what happened to our wood products system? Well, here is what happened. See what happened on Federal forest lands. This is 1980 here, top level, about 11 billion board feet sold. Then it drops way down in the red. Where did we get the lumber? Imports. Soft wood lumber imports right there, the blue and the yellow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this came along, we said timber receipts are down, so we are going to replace it, 6 years ago, now almost 7. We authorized this Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The country has 7,500 national forests and grasslands covering 192 million acres. That is the size of Texas, by the way. Our State of Oregon has 15 national forests. We are proud of them.  You need to know they cover 14 million acres, or nearly one-quarter of the State's land mass. There are forests in my district that cover nearly 12 million acres.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To put this in perspective, within the Forest Service regions 8 and 9, which cover 34 States, all States east of the Missouri River, Oklahoma and Texas, there are 52 national forests covering 25 million acres. My district alone has nearly half that amount of acreage. You can see those of us in the rural West are really impacted by what goes on in the Federal lands, whether it is search and rescue operations, forest fire operations. You name it, it is expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Federal reserves were created, we set up this funding mechanism, again going back to 1908 and then coming forward. The problem now is promise to rural schools, the promise to rural communities, and the promise to rural roads has been broken. It broke last year, and it is up to us now in this Congress to keep the faith with the school kids of America and rural America, to keep faith with the resource advisory committees. They are bringing environmentalists and others together to improve  forest health and habitat, great projects all over the country, to keep faith with basic county services that are being provided, funded by this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Folks, last checks went out the end of the year. What is happening now is the pink slips are going out. Road departments are being cut in half. County sheriffs' departments are being cut in half. School teachers getting pink slips, being told, we are not sure we will have the money to hire you back next year. This is now a crisis, and it is time for Congress to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would at this point like to yield to my colleague from Oregon, my partner in this effort, <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>, to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, Peter DeFazio from southern Oregon, the Fourth District.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership on this issue and for bringing this both to the attention of the House and the American people. Obviously, we don't need to do much to communicate the level of concern with people at home and in our districts, or even in hundreds of counties scattered across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, across America, over 4,400 rural schools in 40 States will lose funding if this legislation is not reauthorized. 4,400 rural school districts. You can bet most of those rural school districts are already hurting trying to provide the next generation of young Americans with a good education. In some counties all the rural schools will be closed due to a lack of funding if this legislation is not reauthorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from Oregon already talked earlier about the highly publicized search and rescue that went on back at the end of last year, the beginning of this year, for the Kim family. You know, this is not, this was a difficult search and rescue mission, since we didn't know where that family was. They were difficult to locate until later they were found by high-tech tech means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fact is that we will not even have the capability to begin those searches in many counties in southern Oregon and, indeed, across the West and some other parts of the country if this legislation is not reauthorized. Deputy sheriffs are already receiving layoff notices. Counties don't have the same fiscal year as they have here in Washington D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many counties, the money authorized last October is going to run out about 3 months into their next fiscal year, so we have to begin now to send out layoff notices. We will have hundreds of thousands of square miles of the western United States with no rural law enforcement. What a mecca for meth dealers, organized crime and other criminal elements, potentially even terrorists, if our counties cannot support basic rural law enforcement services; 780 rural counties will lose funding for roads,  roads that provide the movement of the trees to the mills that provide the movement of Americans to recreate in</paragraph>
    <paragraph>their great public lands. Those funds would dramatically cut and in some cases almost eliminate it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we are talking about a lot of money here, you are right. It is a lot of money where I come from. It is a lot of money for most Americans: $400 million a year is invested in counties and rural schools across America, and the return is many times that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me talk about an element of something we haven't talked about yet. It is not just critical services, not just schools, not just law enforcement, not just search and rescue. It is actually benefits to the public lands. Here on chart 1, I have before and after photos of hazardous fuels reduction near Eureka, California, in an at-risk community adjacent to public lands in northern California, obviously before, after. That will cut fire fighting costs, it will save lives, it will save resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we have another that depicts peeled logs that are being used for temporary utility poles, actually in the southeastern United States after the Katrina disaster. Again, these came out of a watershed improvement program, a fuel reduction program, funded by these payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then finally I have here, yes, economic diversification, local economic development, small investments in peeling logs and creating posts here at the Hayfork South Highway Three Fuels Reduction Project in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So these investments benefit the resource. So we are not just talking about crucial public services. We are also talking about money that we have put back into the resources. We live there. We know how valuable these resources are. We want to save them and improve them for future generations; but without these funds, some of that investment will be put at risk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would just like to follow up on something the gentleman said. You talked about law enforcement needs on these rural lands. Wheeler County, Oregon, population less than 2,000 people, has three deputies and a sheriff. Total of four are doing law enforcement. They will have to layoff a quarter of their force as a result of the loss of this program if we don't reauthorize it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I tell you that because they are responsible for patrolling 1,833 square miles. That is an area 30 times larger than the District of Columbia. You are going to have three officers, the sheriff and a couple of deputies, over 30 times the size of the district, you have got more than that probably standing right out behind us here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, who are these deputies? One of them rides horseback. He is out riding horseback on Federal land, and what does he come across? I don't know if you can see this, but he comes across a $19 million marijuana grove. These little vertical lines here, horizontal lines here, are a marijuana grove, a Mexican drug cartel with illegal nationals doing the cultivation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is amazing to me they got it to grow out there, but they did. It is a $19 million growth spread over a quarter of a mile of Federal lands, and it was one of these sheriff deputies riding horseback that spotted this. These are on Federal lands. Why is the Federal Government doing this? Well, the Federal Government is helping to pay for some of this, but now it is breaking its promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield now to our colleague from Oregon (Ms. Hooley), who has been a real champion in helping us on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for yielding. I just want to talk a little bit about the commitment the Federal Government made. We made this commitment, as one of my colleagues said, almost 100 years ago, that we were going to help those counties that had a lot of timber. I used to be a county commissioner. Over 50 percent of the Clackamas County was in Federal forest land, which means we didn't get revenue from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we first started this program, when we cut the timber, then we got revenue sharing. It was in lieu of taxes because this was land we couldn't tax, couldn't develop, couldn't tax. Then when the forest land came along, obviously those numbers were cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rural counties had a double whammy. They lost good-paying jobs and they lost that revenue sharing. Almost 7 years ago, when we reauthorized this program to say we are going to help our rural communities, they are really important. I mean, rural communities, I think, are what keeps us the kind of country we are. I mean, that is where so many of our values were started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We said we were going to help them, and we were going to help with roads,  and they have just the number of miles a rural county has, we are going to help with roads. We would help with those rural schools so that all of our children had a chance to go to school and have a good education. We said we would help with law enforcement, so we were trying to help those counties make sure they could keep going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to tell you every county in my district is very frugal. I do not see programs that are wasteful. They spend every dollar they have as well as they can spend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this, if we do not get the money for this program, let me talk a little bit about what is going to happen to some of my counties. One of my counties is Polk County. It is a small rural farming community. It is not as big as one of the counties you were talking about. It only has 740 square miles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The county will essentially go down to five deputies from 18 now; six of those are paid by the Grand Ronde Tribe, and they can only patrol a small portion, but they will lose at least seven deputies. They have started a wonderful program to go after meth and drugs. They have been very successful. That program is going to be gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The county jail is going to lose two positions, and let me tell you something, they are already at the State minimum on county positions. I don't know what they are going to do when they lose two more. I don't know how they operate. They have a small district attorney's office. They are going to lose a secretary, and they are going to lose a DA, but this is just typical of what is happening in every county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I know you put up this chart, and I want to put it up one more time, because I think it is really important; and this is a chart that is what has happened to Federal timber receipts. All you have to do is look since 1994, you can see in 1990, it was the highest, or 1988, and then it has gone down and down and down. So the counties are no longer getting money from the timber receipts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only way we can keep these counties going is through this program that allows us to make sure that we can continue our rural communities and that we can continue our schools, that we can continue law enforcement. You talked a little bit about search and rescue. A couple of my counties have had huge cases this year where, and, again, you talked about loss of life with the climbers on Mount Hood, we talked about the Kim family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Search and rescue, when you have a county that has a lot of wilderness, you get people that are lost. We all feel badly when someone is lost, and none of us will hesitate to go look for that person, but it means it takes resources, it takes money to make that happen. So the loss of money for these rural counties is just devastating to them. We made a promise, and I don't know about you guys, but I grew up in a family that said, if you make a promise, you keep that promise. We need to keep our  promises to our counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I could follow up. You talked about Polk County. Klamath County has a total law enforcement operation of 35 officers to patrol 6,000 square miles. 6,000 square miles. They have to cut that by a third. Sheriff Tom Evinger says they may well end up having no law enforcement patrols at night, nor do the state police patrol at night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is an area 100 times larger than the District of Columbia. And when they do patrol they will have no back up. I mean, this is really serious stuff, folks. Search and rescue as you mentioned, the loss on Mt. Hood, but the loss down in southern Oregon, those are just the two that caught the media's attention, and the country and the world's attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me suggest, as we all know from the northwest, there are many, many more search and rescue operations going on all of the time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>They go on almost daily. I just want to mention another county. Tillamook County, which is a small coastal community. It is county that has struggled. And they struggle with high-paying jobs. They have had a terrible year with floods and wind storms. About everything bad that can happen to a county has happened to Tillamook County especially in this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But they are having to layoff anywhere from 25 to 60 employees, they do not know yet. But literally they will reduce their county road fund by half. Again, it is a county that has struggled with floods. They have had a lot of repairs. I tried to get into Tillamook County to go look at the damage from floods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I found out, well, actually I couldn't get in from the north, I couldn't get in from the east, you had to go clear around and come in going south to north to actually get to Tillamook County. So many of their roads were just wiped out, and yet they are going to lose a good percentage of their county road fund.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would comment. And certainly the gentleman from southern Oregon too, that Lake County, this is 93 percent of their road budget. 93 percent of the road budget. I think you can probably put the State of New Hampshire inside Lake County and still have some room to graze cattle.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am sure you could</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is so serious to those counties. We have got to get this done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have been joined by a couple of other Members, I am sure we want to get to those. But just a quick thing. I came from Lane County, I was a commissioner in the early 1980s, when we had a drop off in timber revenues due to markets and not as catastrophic as this. And yet at that time, in a county this size, and we have to relate this to our colleagues back here, they cannot understand how big our districts are, a county which is just one of my counties, the size of the  State of Connecticut had no rural law enforcement patrols outside of contract deputies and a couple of small communities, a county the size of the State of Connecticut. And we are headed back to that point in many counties in the western United States.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just want to remind people too in trying to get our colleagues to understand, this is not an Oregon problem, it is not just a Washington problem, it is not just a northern California problem, this is a problem across the United States. We are hit specifically very hard because of the amount of Federal forests that we have in our State. But this cuts across, I think it is 4,400 different school districts benefit from this program. It is absolutely critical.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>I do see we have been joined by a couple other of colleagues, Cathy McMorris Rogers from the great State of Washington, who has been very active on forest and forest health issues when I chaired that subcommittee last session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Mike Thompson from northern California has joined us as well. He has been active in helping us on this. Perhaps we could turn from our colleague from Washington State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. McMorris Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Walden and Mr. DeFazio for your leadership on this issue, for organizing this time for all of us this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the honor of representing a district in eastern Washington. We are known for our vast public forests in that area. We have over 2 1/2  million acres of forest lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And these lands and this timber plays a very important role in our region's economy. Maintaining healthy forests is essential to those who make a living from the land, and for those who use it for other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately there are a number of critical issues that impact the health and the economic stability of the forests in our region. As many have mentioned this evening, since 1908 the counties that host forest lands from which timber is cut receive a share from the Federal Government of the timber receipts, about 25 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is such important money for these counties and schools, used to fund road improvements, fire stations, police protection. And yet as the timber sales have declined, funding received by the counties and schools have also declined. It is because of that issue that we come before you tonight, and that the Secure Rural Schools Fund was originally established, and why it is so important that it continues to be established.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is essential for the livelihood of rural communities in eastern Washington. The Federal Government owns the majority of the land in many of the counties I represent, like others have  mentioned tonight, for example Okanogan County, which is one of the largest counties in the country, it is 73 percent owned by the Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That means 27 percent of the remaining land that is under private ownership is the tax base for a county that is six times the size of Rhode Island. That is the funding from those lands that is used to support search and rescue. Last year they saved a woman's life. And this year they will be forced to cut the special training and equipment and the jobs of some of those who work on the team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without revenue from timber receipts, along with the inability to tax Federal land, these communities do not have enough money to provide essential community services and educational opportunities. I remain hopeful that we will be able to find the funding for the reauthorization of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful because we do not have another option. In Ferry County, the largest employer was Vaagen Brothers Lumber. I say was because they had to close in 2003. Ferry County has 18 percent private ownership of land. And they too are dependent upon these resources, and we need to keep the promise to our rural communities and schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the State of Washington, half of the money from the secure rural schools goes to support schools. It means $21 million for the State of Washington, and although I would prefer this money go to the schools that are actually timber-dependent schools, nevertheless it is important money to our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Newport, Washington it means a difference in music or art or maybe the difference in a foreign language teacher. Our timber-dependent schools simply do not have the capacity to make up this kind of funding cut. The purpose of this act is to stabilize payments to counties that help support roads and schools, provide projects that enhance forest ecosystem health, and provide employment opportunities among the Federal land management agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to point out last year, just one example in my district, we had over 200,000 acres burn. Now this is in Okanogan County, this is a county that is nearly 75 percent owned by the Federal Government. And what we see here is the burn, the brown and the light yellow is where over 200,000 acres were burned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pink areas here 1 1/2  percent of what burned is what is proposed to be salvaged. Hopefully soon, although it is in dispute too. This in my mind demonstrates part of the challenge that we have, because this is a recent example in a county that is desperate for support for community services, trees have been lost. In the past I would have preferred for us to be able to go in there, even like 10 years ago, and be able to harvest some of these trees, create some timber receipts for this county  rather than facing this situation where we have had devastating burns, with now very little of that burn being able to be salvaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have here a chart showing wildland acres burned over the last several years. The yellow indicates the year 2000, the green is 2005, the red is 2006, and the blue indicates a 10-year average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see, this all starts back in May and ends in November. But, again, over several periods of years, last year, we saw record amounts of fire on Federal lands. In fact, we spent a billion and a half dollars fighting fire. We burned more than 9 million acres. That is a record. And it just keeps getting worse and worse. So we have got a real problem out in the forest, and that affects our communities and our counties, because when you have these fires, what happens? Law enforcement has  to go out and manage the roads and manager the flow of people, and they are doing around-the-clock vigil work on do we have to evacuate or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And of course the Forest Service is involved too, but a lot of that burden falls on that local community. I have had whole communities close for very important times in the summer, because of fires approaching. Sisters, Oregon comes to mind. So your comment about wildfires is very apropos tonight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="RODGERS, McMORRIS" of="">
    <paragraph>Like many of the counties in Oregon, I would say we face a similar situation in Washington State. And these are counties that do not want to be dependent on the Federal Government. They would prefer for the Forest Service to be managing these lands in such a way that would actually produce more timber receipts and result in a healthier forest so we do not continue to see these devastating fires every year, and they are getting worse every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, unfortunately, that is not what is happening. In the meantime, we really do need to reauthorize the secure rural schools. That is so important to our local communities that are surrounded by these National forests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provided the funding for schools and roads, and right now is ensuring that our rural communities survive these difficult times. I thank you for the opportunity to speak.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>We thank you for coming out tonight to share your comments with our colleagues and others about the importance of trying to get this reauthorized. I would yield now to our distinguished colleague, the gentleman from the first district of California, MIKE THOMPSON, whose district receives more than $6 million a year to help cover the costs of law enforcement, education, and other natural resource work that goes on there. So I yield to my colleague from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400403" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank all of you who have taken time to come to the floor tonight to talk about this very, very important issue, an issue that impacts all of our districts, and most important the people that live within our districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, and Members of this House, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act was created to provide critical education and transportation funding for all of the counties that do not receive property tax from lands managed by the National Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program was enacted by this Congress to compensate local governments for the tax exempt status of these public lands. The law authorizing these payments, as you have heard tonight, expired at the end of fiscal year 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And all of the counties that are touched by this issue received their last payment on December 2 of 2006. If we do not reauthorize this funding by the 15th of March, county school districts will have to fire teachers, and reduce critical education programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Counties will be forced to slash their transportation budgets. My Congressional district is heavily impacted by this issue, because of over 1.2 million acres that are managed by the National Forest Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Forest Service acreage in my district is twice the size of the State of Rhode Island, and every single acre is exempt from property tax. No county in my district will be hurt more than Del Norte County. I have a map of Del Norte County, not wanting to be outdone by my friends with their visuals, but no county will be hurt more in my district than Del Norte County, where nearly 80 percent of the county, 80 percent of all of the land within the county is owned by our Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jan Moorehouse, the Superintendent of the school district up in Del Norte, and she was I think very, very succinct in pointing out the problem. I will just tell you what she said. I cannot say it any better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She said, the loss of funding is heart wrenching and carries an enormous impact on our ability to fund critical education programs for our youth. This is our future leaders. These are the people that will serve in Congress, serve in the State legislature, run the businesses, be on the city council, the people that will make the money to generate the greatness that our country is known for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And we are taking money right out of their education, the things that will benefit them the most. Without this funding, the school district will have to increase their class size and lay off as many as 25 teachers. And that may not seem a lot to big city school districts, but up here it is nearly 10 percent of the entire teaching faculty. With more students and less teachers, this will dramatically reduce the student to teacher ratio and shortchange our kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the loss of faculty, Del Norte County School District will have to close their art and music programs, and some of the smaller schools in our county will have to close completely because they won't have the money to keep the doors open. Now, this is going to require that the school district bus students who live far from town travel over an hour each way to school on seasonably treacherous rural mountain roads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other county school districts in my district will also be hit hard and will have to eliminate teachers and staff for early literacy programs, special education and arts education. The Klamath-Trinity School District on the Hoopa Indian Reservation will have to lay off eight teachers, nearly 15 percent of their entire faculty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as I mentioned earlier, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act also provides critical funding for county transportation needs. Again, this is because the counties do not receive property tax from land managed by the National Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Humboldt County in my district has over 1,200 miles of county roads. The funding this program provides represents a large portion of that county's road maintenance budgets. Humboldt County has a  maintenance backlog of over $150 million. Many other rural counties have similar backlogs, and the loss of this funding is going to be devastating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in Del Norte County, the transportation money from this program represents 20 percent of the county road budget. And to add insult to injury, 40 percent of the county roads in Del Norte County are within the national forest. So the county is responsible for maintaining the roads in the very areas that are exempt from property taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and Members, I urge this Congress to reauthorize and to fund this very important program as soon as possible. It is unconscionable for the Federal Government to walk away from our obligation to help these rural counties. Rural counties depend on these funds. They have no other option. We made a commitment, and it is up to us to follow through on that commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank you for taking the time to put this Special Order together and help us convince all of our colleagues how necessary and how important this program is and how critically important these funds are to a large area within our great country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congressman Thompson. We appreciate your vigilance in our efforts to try and get this reauthorized; and your comments tonight, I think, are very powerful in our efforts. You talk about roads. Morrow County road department has 19 employees to service 850 miles of county roads. They are going to be forced to lay off at least seven, perhaps as many as nine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wallowa County, 700 miles, county roads maintained by a staff of 14. Soon there will only be seven. That is possibly one person for every 100 miles of road or the same distance from here to Richmond, Virginia. You would have one road maintenance person. This story is repeated over and over in my district, Congresswoman Hooley's district, your district, Congressman DeFazio's district, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers' district. All over the rural West we are facing this  enormous problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And people love to come out into their Federal forests. I love to get out into our Federal forests. I love to backpack and do all the things many of us do. It is a wonderful attraction. But people get lost, they get injured, and who is there to pick them up? The local county. The county sheriff, the local rescue patrol. And that is why this funding is so important so they will have the resources, they will have the people when you break a leg or you fall down an ice shaft somewhere. There is  somebody to come get you. And that is just the rescue part and the police part. We have talked a lot about the schools as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my friend from Clackamas County, Congresswoman Hooley, did you want to comment?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, this is a program that has worked well over the last 6 years. It has helped bridge that budget gap created due to the lack of timber harvested from our forest. And, again, I want to remind people this is distributed to over 42 States; 4,400 rural school districts receive funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want to support our rural communities, if we want to make sure that we have roads to drive on, if we believe law enforcement is important to every part of our State, then we have to figure out how to solve this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I thank you and Representative DeFazio for all the work that you have done. But we have a full blown crisis on our hands. That is what this is. This is a crisis. And it will take support from our colleagues from both sides of the aisle to help our rural communities that are, frankly, in dire straits. This is not just a little problem. This is a great big huge problem for our rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would urge my friends to join us in our effort to reauthorize this program and pass a 1-year extension to give us a chance to work through these difficult issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, I thank you for all the work that you have done on it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>And we appreciate your help on it too. And I think we have all signed a letter to the appropriators asking them that in the emergency supplemental they fund at least a 1-year extension while we work on a longer equitable solution to this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague from southern Oregon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>My friend, Representative Hooley, mentioned reauthorization. I do want to thank the chairman of the Resources Committee, Nick Rahall from West Virginia. And, yes, this touches West Virginia too. There are communities at risk there that are working hard to help us move the reauthorization bill for the longer-term funding in the Resources Committee, hopefully next month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And obviously my colleague from southern Oregon, Representative Walden, when he was Chair of the Forest Subcommittee of Resources, he and I, quite quickly, and I think just about, almost 2 years ago--</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>March of 2005 we moved it out of subcommittee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Moved the authorization out, but it unfortunately got hung up in the process and never did become law although we certainly saw more action on this side of the Hill than we did in the Senate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would you yield just on one point?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, sure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Because you mentioned West Virginia. And Rita Griffith from Pocahontas County, she is a commissioner there. She says nine full-time teaching positions will be cut and funding for an after-school forestry education program will be lost. She is from Pocahontas County, West Virginia. I have got examples from Alaska and Arizona to California and West Virginia, so you are right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>And just since the gentleman from California had referenced Del Norte County, I just want to talk about the county immediately to the north of that which would be Curry County, Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some people will say, look, why don't these counties just suck it up and take care of their own problems, raise the taxes? Well, in Oregon, our local property tax structure is dictated by the State because of a property tax initiative similar to the one that passed in California. The local commissioners do not have any options when it comes to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if Curry County was going to grow its way out of this problem, a county that today has 12,000 houses valued at about $250,000 each, they would have to add 35,000 houses valued at $350,000 each, quadruple the size of the county. And, unfortunately, since they are constrained by public lands----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>And the ocean.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>And the Pacific Ocean, some of those would have to be house boats, I guess.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is hard to have a house boat in the ocean.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>But it is very serious. And there they are looking at the layoff of 16 of the 43 employees in the Curry County Sheriff's Office. And the sheriff would just then only be able to supervise the jail. There would no longer be a rural law enforcement, which obviously jeopardizes the traveling public and, again, raises the potential, as the gentleman from southern Oregon who represents also eastern  Oregon pointed out, of a vacuum into  which some of these gangs that are highly organized in this country, some of which have come across the border from Mexico could infiltrate for methamphetamine production or even growing marijuana.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>And, in fact, you think about in our State and in Northern California how many meth labs have been found on Federal lands, found by county sheriffs deputies generally. They are the ones out there. Now, there are other law enforcement agencies, but a lot of it is that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I showed you the marijuana growing that that lone deputy, by himself, no backup, on horseback out riding in the Federal lands, found 6,000 plants in a Mexican cartel drug trafficking operation. This is going on out on Federal lands. And it is not like the Forest Service has a huge police force to go patrol their own lands. They don't. And so it is a severe problem.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just want to add to the whole, when you are talking about drug problems and meth problems, we were one of the States that had, the west coast was hit the hardest with meth. It has now moved east. But I was just going to say, it is the rural counties that are hit more by meth than are the urban counties because they can go out in the forest, they can make meth, cook meth out in the forestlands, grow marijuana. But we spend a lot of our time out there looking for drug problems, and  it is a huge issue in all of our rural counties.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>But of course it ends up in a lot of urban areas, so it is their problem, too.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Exactly. We have been joined by our colleague from Northern California, Wally Herger, who serves the adjoining area, at least to mine. And I don't know if he touches up against your district or not. But he does an extraordinarily able job representing Northern California and has been very active in forestry issues and forest health issues over the years. And we are delighted you could join us tonight to talk about the importance of reauthorizing <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman, my good friend from Oregon, Mr. Walden. And I thank the work that Mr. DeFazio is doing and the others in this incredibly, crucially important issue that affects those of us in rural areas of the West, particularly, and in these forested areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like both of you, I have a heavily forested district and I understand the challenges that our rural communities face because of the large Federal presence in our area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our fellow citizens, and even some of the Members of this body, do not realize that the presence of Federal lands places a burden on nearby communities. I am so pleased to join you tonight in shining the light on that fact and reminding our colleagues that the Secure Rural Schools program has expired and is in need of reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district of Northern California, school boards, county officials, and sheriff departments are currently in crisis mode. For example, Siskiyou County is looking at a 91 percent loss in school funding. In Tehama County, library hours, music, art, and physical education classes will be dramatically cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this crisis extends well beyond education. County road safety programs will be decimated as well. Sheriff departments will also bear the brunt of these cuts. In total, eight of my 10 counties are experiencing drastic budget declines because Congress has not extended the Secure Rural Schools program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to point out to our friends who represent urban areas that this crisis is not the fault of rural counties. It is the fault of Federal policies that are out of their control, specifically the failure of Congress to address that burden by extending the Secure and Rural Schools program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of California, close to half of the land area is owned by the Federal Government. And in my district that number is considerably larger. In one of my counties, nearly 90 percent of the land is under Federal ownership. This large Federal presence has placed the counties I represent at a severe economic disadvantage. Acreage that would normally be privately owned and, therefore, generating tax revenue to help fund essential local services, is, instead, locked away by the Federal  Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Teddy Roosevelt and our predecessors who served in the 60th Congress recognized this problem and addressed it with a promise which was enshrined in the law in 1908, that the Federal Government would pay its fair share of local costs by sending a percentage of national forest revenues to the counties that are home to Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This promise acknowledged that the rural counties we represent would not be able to fund vital services like rural education, road maintenance and emergency care as long as enormous tracts of land within their boundaries were locked away under Federal control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to be very clear about the nature of the promise that was struck between Congress and rural forested counties. These funds were not designed to be a handout, and they are not part of any federally sponsored rural development program. They are an obligation. They are part of a compact between the Federal Government and the people of rural America in recognition of the difficulties created by large Federal ownership. This compact must be honored by the 110th Congress that we are currently  in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The rural counties I represent, and I know this is true in other areas throughout the West, have sacrificed a great deal playing host to America's national forests. I don't think it is too much to ask for this Congress to set aside a fraction of our $2.9 trillion budget in order to keep our word to rural America. We need to act immediately to extend the Secure Rural Schools safety net so our rural counties can get out of crisis mode, and then we can all get back to working on a long-term solution  to our forest health problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to thank my colleagues here tonight for your efforts to extend the Secure Rural Schools program. I am committed to working with each of you until we are successful, and I ask other Members of the House to recognize the incredible hardships that will result if this legislation is not renewed.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Second District California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate your great work on forest health issues and your support of this effort. You mentioned this was just a fraction of what we spend federally for the Federal Government to keep its word. As you recall, we tried to get an amendment on the floor during the debate over the continuing resolution a week or so ago and we would have paid for that by just taking a fraction of what is spent for the whole government. That fraction was .00086 percent of the Federal budget that would pay for this;  but not just pay for it, it would keep the commitment of this government to the people out West and elsewhere where there are forests that have been there for up until now 100 years basically, 99 years. So it doesn't take a lot to keep your word, and we need to keep the promise regarding forest health and schools and roads and other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we appreciate your work on this, Congressman Herger. Thanks for your leadership.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me just mention two other counties. I have got a list here. I see another gentleman from Washington that we want to hear from him. But the most heavily impacted county in my district will be Josephine County, and their general fund revenues have dropped 69 percent. Again, a dramatic loss of public safety.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is a county we share.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Right. And road services. And then in Coos County, more than half the general fund. Layoff notices have already gone out to 100 out of a 430-person workforce. Again, the deepest cuts, because it is the largest proportion of the budget, public safety, again, the loss of patrol deputies. It is going to be a very, very difficult time when tourists from all across America come to southwest Oregon this summer. If they are in an accident or have other problems in rural areas across  large swaths of our State, there will be no immediate help for them.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Most of the States this side of the Mississippi have less than 7 or 8 percent Federal ownership. In my district, much like like  yours, Deschutes County is 79 percent federally controlled. Lake is 78; Harney is 78; Malheur is 76; Hood River is 72; Grant is 61; Wallowa is 58; and Baker is 53 percent of the land masses under Federal ownership and control. That is why this is so important that the Federal Government keep its word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like now to yield to our good friend and colleague from the Fourth District of Washington, the Honorable Doc Hastings, whose district receives $8.8 million a year to help with roads and schools in a very federally dominated area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Doc, you have been a terrific leader in this effort, and we appreciate your coming down tonight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank you and I want to thank Mr. DeFazio, both, for your work on this not only in this Congress, but your yeomen's work at the end of the last Congress to try to get this problem resolved. And I apologize for coming down late. I wanted to participate more fully, but the Rules Committee is meeting, as we are speaking, on the Iraq issue. So I was up there and didn't have a chance to come down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me make a couple of points here. This really is about keeping a commitment that was made by the Federal Government to the counties. And you just made the point there that States with counties in the western part of the United States have a lot of Federal ownership. I have two counties that I just want to talk about in my district where over 80 percent of their land is owned by the Federal Government. Now, by definition that means that 80 percent of the taxable land that the county commission  would have is not subject to taxation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decision was made over 100 years ago for these national forestlands, which is principally in my area. I know you have some development lands in yours. But since they don't have taxation, they said okay. Deals were worked out many years ago that you can have the revenue from harvesting the timber, which worked out very, very well. So that is the Federal policy that was made. The Federal Government owns the land in these counties; so, therefore, they can't tax it. It is Federal policy. In the  early 1990s, another Federal policy or interpretation, I should probably say, of a Federal policy has led to a decline in timber receipts, as you can see here by the chart.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>This chart here shows it very clearly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>When President Clinton, to his credit, tried to come up with a forest plan, the current level at that time of timber harvest was 4 1/2  billion board-feet, and the promise was that you could at least harvest 1.1 billion, 25 percent of it. We are not even close to that. We are not even close to that because the interpretation of that law and the ensuing lawsuits have kept any activity in these multipurpose areas. And I should make this point: This is national forestland.  National forests were created to be multipurpose, including commercial activity. If you want to lock it up and not have any activity at all, the way to do that is put it in a wilderness area. This is not wilderness. Some de facto policies, unfortunately, in the past have</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chelan County in my district, one of the counties that has 80 percent ownership by the Federal Government, will have severe cuts in education, road maintenance, search and rescue, and this is a big tourist area up there, and the forestry education programs. Skamania County, a small county in the southern part of my district, loses 40 percent of its school budget. Forty percent of its school budget. And here we are and that 40 percent starts at the end of last year and they have to get through  the end of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is something that needs to be resolved, and I really appreciate your allowing me to come down to participate in this. Both of you have been really champions on getting this through. And, hopefully, we will be successful sooner rather than later, because these counties and these communities in our States simply can't wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues here this evening to urge this Congress to take action now and extend the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, commonly referred to as the county payments bill. This bill is an essential lifeline of support for rural communities throughout the country that are impacted by federal forest land ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues, Greg Walden and Peter DeFazio, for their steadfast efforts to address this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are talking about here tonight is keeping a promise--a promise made to county governments a century ago in what was then still the early years of the National Forest system. County governments, of course, cannot tax the Federal Government. However, they still must provide for schools, roads, and emergency services. The Congress recognized this reality when it promised these communities that they would get a fair share of revenue produced from federal forest lands as compensation for the  tax exempt status of federal forest lands. This revenue sharing, which Congress made permanent in 1908, served all parties well and was for many years an equitable solution to the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, since the early 90s, special interest groups that oppose federal timber sales have used the Endangered Species Act to bring harvest activities in the Pacific Northwest to a standstill. The Clinton administration attempted to resolve the crisis by brokering the Northwest Forest Plan in 1994, which called for setting aside 80 percent of the federal forests in the Northwest and allowing for a modest level of continued harvest on some of what remained. This was supposed to produce  a steady and reliable level of timber to help meet the growing U.S. demand for building materials and wood products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, even this compromise was not good enough for the radical environmentalists that have continuously used litigation to sharply limit federal harvest levels. What resulted is the closure of hundreds of mills throughout the Northwest--leaving thousands of people without family wage jobs and many counties with little or no compensation for the impact of federal land ownership. Today, we import more wood products than we ever did before, and the spotted owl--which was supposedly what all the  litigation was about--isn't any closer to recovery as a result of our de facto zero harvest policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the Congress at least recognized the dramatic impact to local governments caused by the sharply declining Forest Service timber receipts. This is why we passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act in 2000. This law, which expired at the end of Fiscal Year 2006, enabled local governments to either remain with the traditional receipt sharing system or take a payment based on historical harvest levels. In addition, it authorized funding for local governments  to work</paragraph>
    <paragraph>in cooperation with interested stakeholders to carry out special forest restoration projects. These payments made the difference for many county governments that would otherwise not be able to provide essential services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, however, the future of these payments is in doubt. Despite the many efforts on both sides of the aisle, we were unable to secure an extension of this bill before the 109th Congress adjourned. I am proud of the fact that the House did at least identify and act upon a couple of legislative items last year that would have helped offset the cost of the reauthorization. However, the situation remains that we need to find a way to get the county payments extension through the Congress and on  to the President. Time is quickly running out for these rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you examples of what will happen to two of my counties if we fail to act now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chelan County, which is almost 80 percent federally-owned land, will face severe cuts in education, road maintenance, search and rescue operations and many other county services. In addition, they would be forced to eliminate the Forestry Education Program, which takes "at risk kids" from several local rural school districts and involves them in hands on habitat restoration projects during the summer. This program is administered with the help of Washington State University and local employees  of state and federal agencies and has been recognized by the National Association of County Officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Skamania County, which is more than 80 percent tax exempt federal land, the local school districts will lose 40 percent of their current budget. That means the loss of dozens of teachers and support positions, the shuttering of school buildings, and dramatic cutbacks in classes and extracurricular offerings. The county government would be forced to cut more than half of their law enforcement personnel, road workers, and court employees. These people will likely have to leave the county to  find alternate employment, taking their families with them and further eroding the county's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these are just a couple of examples of the kinds of the consequences to real communities if we fail to act. I again urge the leadership of the Congress to move the extension of the county payments bill on the next available legislative vehicle. Let's keep our promise to these local governments and reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act before it's too late.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work and his help in the Rules Committee and on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have been most diligent and most helpful and we appreciate your comments tonight. Harney County Judge Steve Grasty has said, "Loss of this program means losing future opportunities for young people here and in rural counties across America." We have comments like that, and I am sure Peter does as well, from every county that is affected, every school superintendent who is trying now to work with their school boards to figure out who stays, who goes, what gets cut, what gets left behind,  and what do we do to help rural kids keep up in a school system that is going to be devastated by the loss of these dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a national problem. These are national lands. National policy determines what happens on these lands, and you can see by the reduction in Federal timber receipts, one of the outcomes of Federal policy has been near elimination of receipts, which has brought us to this legislation, which now is expired. And I appreciate the work of my colleague from the Fourth District of Washington as we work to reauthorize this to keep the Federal Government's promise to rural schools, rural roads, rural  counties, and our Federal forestlands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield to my colleague.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, again just to reiterate, 4,400 school districts across America, I believe, of more than 800 counties are impacted. Critical law enforcement, public safety, search and rescue services, road maintenance services, schools, school class size, school infrastructure, all these things are on the cutting block. Benton County in my district tried a levy. It failed. Again, the cuts will be targeted at law enforcement and the sheriffs' offices. That is the biggest part of the  general fund for virtually all my counties. They have no choice.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am told our time is about up. I just appreciate your help and that of our colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would encourage all of our colleagues who are listening tonight, help us pass <bill type="h" number="17">H.R. 17</bill>. Help us keep the promise to these rural people who are surrounded in their areas by Federal lands, which are gorgeous and we love them, but we need your help to deal with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank all of our colleagues who came down at this very late hour on the East Coast to share their comments and concerns. And together we can keep the promise for America.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for full reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district in southwest Washington state is one of the 10 most forested districts in the entire country. Because so much of the land in my district is under the control of the Forest Service, counties in my district like Lewis, Skamania, and Cowlitz rely on the Secure Rural Schools program. They are among 27 counties in Washington state that rely on funds of over $40 million a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These communities do not want to rely on this program, but a long series of events have left them without recourse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, heavily forested counties could rely on 25 percent of revenue generated by timber harvest in our federal forests. National Forests cannot be taxed locally, so this was a fair exchange. As timber harvest plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s, these local governments were left with barely enough funds to operate essential government services, including schools. The 2000 Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act saved these communities from dying off. It has allowed them  to hire teachers, keep libraries open, and provide the services that many of us take for granted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Secure Rural Schools is about more then county payments. The program also authorizes Resource Advisory Councils and designates 15 percent to 20 percent of the county payments towards these Councils, known as RACs. RACs bring together members of the community including environmentalists, labor groups, and local elected officials to collaborate on necessary forestry projects. These forestry projects include preventive thinning that limits the danger of fires in our forests. Over 9 million acres  of land burned in fires in 2006. Collaborative efforts to prevent this damage are a model that needs to be refined and expanded. That can only happen if we continue funding the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the 780 counties, 4,400 school districts, and millions of Americans affected by this program, I implore my colleagues to help reauthorize and fund the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act. If we fail to reauthorize this critical program, counties in my district will see their school district budgets cut by more than 40 percent, community programs and services will be slashed, and jobs will be lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must act now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
