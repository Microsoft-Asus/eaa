  <narrative>HOW MUCH LONGER WILL OUR TROOPS CONTINUE TO SACRIFICE? -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2076]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker made it clear that the Bush administration intends to continue its current strategy in Iraq with no changes, despite absolutely no progress on political reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today when we listen to both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testify again, it's important to remember that the principal objective of the President's troop escalation plan was to give the Iraq Government time and the proper environment to create political reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently returned from Iraq, and it's obvious that the political reconciliation that we hoped for is not taking place. They have had both, but the reconciliation remains elusive. General Petraeus himself has admitted that there has been no sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much longer will General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker and this administration demand our troops and our Nation continue to sacrifice for the sake of an Iraqi government that is unwilling and unable to secure its own future? I would like to hear the answer to that question today, because many of us here in Congress do not believe it is our Nation's best interest to keep more troops on the ground in Iraq.</paragraph>
