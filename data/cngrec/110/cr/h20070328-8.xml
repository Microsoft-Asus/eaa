  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, rather than pulling out the tired old talking points of "tax and spend," I wish my colleagues and my good friends on the other side of the aisle would actually read the Democratic budget resolution. Really, it makes for pretty good reading.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If they did, they would see that nowhere in the budget do we call for any increase in taxes; nowhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, if the Republicans read our budget, they would see that it actually directs the Ways and Means Committee, of which I am a member, to come up with immediate relief for middle-income families who would otherwise be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Unless we reform that tax, 19 million families will have to pay higher taxes in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President played games with this tax, coming up with only a 1-year fix.  You hear it in your own districts. Democrats are committed to coming up with a permanent solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our budget allows the Ways and Means Committee to extend other middle-income tax relief, including the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief, while remaining true to the PAYGO principle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is a good budget that provides tax relief to middle-income families, and at the same time, finds balance within the next 5 years. I suggest we take a look at it.</paragraph>
