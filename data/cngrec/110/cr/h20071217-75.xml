  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of Congressman Henry J. Hyde, the Representative of the Sixth District of Illinois from 1975 to 2007. Congressman Hyde was a distinguished and well-respected member of this body, serving for 32 years in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure, Congressman Hyde served honorably as the Chairman of the Judiciary and International Relations Committees and contributed much to this Nation. My thoughts and prayers go out to Congressman Hyde's family and friends during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Congressman Hyde's accomplishments are many, I want to take a moment to share one that is both emblematic of the mark he left and of which I am particularly grateful. During the 109th Congress, I had the pleasure of working with Congressman Hyde to help spur the creation of the first Jewish American Heritage Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the lead Republican cosponsor of the House Resolution, Congressman Hyde was instrumental in garnering the support of the President of the United Sates and Republican leadership in the House, especially that of Speaker Hastert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With support from around the country, the House and Senate passed resolutions in early 2006 urging the President to establish American Jewish History Month. President Bush then proclaimed the first Jewish American Heritage Month in May 2006 so that Americans could come together to celebrate the many contributions that Jews have made to the fabric of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to Congressman Hyde's commitment and dedication, American Jewish culture and heritage is now celebrated each May by our Nation. In appreciation of this leadership, and in honor of Congressman Hyde's lifetime commitment to serving his country, I have requested that a tree be planted in Israel dedicated to his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again express my deepest sympathy to Congressman Hyde's family, friends, and the people of Illinois.</paragraph>
