    <paragraph>Mr. President, the first 3 months of the 110th Congress have been very productive. We have shown the American people that when Democrats and Republicans work together results flow. It is interesting, when that happens, there are a lot of positives that can be said by both parties. When we don't accomplish something, there is a lot of criticism that is shared by both parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This productive work began in January when we passed the ethics bill, the most sweeping reform in the history of our country. Next we worked to raise the minimum wage for the first time in a decade. After minimum wage, we finished the fiscal work of the last Congress, the 109th Congress, by passing a responsible continuing resolution with no earmarks. Then we went to homeland security and ensured that 5 years after 9/11, all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission will be implemented. Last  week, we passed a balanced budget which includes over $180 billion in tax breaks for middle-class families and says in the future, if you are going to lower taxes, if you are going to increase spending, you have to have some way to pay for it. Ethics, minimum wage, the continuing resolution, the 9/11 recommendations</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we begin consideration of the 2007 supplemental appropriations bill. This legislation includes more than $121 billion. The vast majority--90 percent of it--is for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also for enhancing military readiness generally, for improving veterans health care--and certainly in the wake of Walter Reed and other scandals regarding how veterans are being taken care of, this is certainly something that is necessary--for national priorities such as rebuilding the gulf  coast and homeland security and I mention, Mr. President, drought assistance, farm disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the western part of the United States, because of this global climate change, we have had millions--I am speaking directly--millions, not thousands, but millions--of acres burned, and unless we figure out some way to restore that vegetation, that land is going foul, to say the least. That is what this is all about--farm aid assistance. Willie Nelson could sing for weeks about the need for this assistance to take place in the West. I am not an expert on wheat, corn, rice, and all those other  products--a lot of people here are--but I am about rangelands and what has happened to Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill contains critical money, as I have indicated, for our troops. We need to get the money to them as quickly as we can. Our troops are serving under difficult conditions. The Senate will ensure they have everything they need to continue this fight as we have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our support, though, for the troops does not stop at funding. We must also ensure our soldiers have a strategy for success. The Democratic-controlled Congress is listening to the American people and fighting to give our troops what they need and strategy--strategy worthy of their sacrifices. That is why in addition to the much needed changes for our troops, the bill also contains a strong message for President Bush: Change course in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend, the distinguished Republican leader, criticized what is in this bill that will be reported to the floor shortly, saying it is not good for the troops. David Brooks, the very conservative editorial writer for the New York Times, said last Friday on the "Jim Lehrer NewsHour": This is ridiculous for anyone to criticize a democracy for debating the most important issue of the day, the war in Iraq. The very conservative David Brooks said this is what democracies are all about. The troops  over there know this is good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have my BlackBerry on my hip. Someone BlackBerried his friend, one of my staff members, who is a full colonel in the Army National Guard out in Nevada. He keeps in touch with his friends. He said what happened in the House and what we put in our bill is good for the troops--this is a soldier e-mailing my friend from Iraq--because it lets the Iraqi Government know we are serious. He went on to say the deadline is important for the Iraqi people and the soldiers, and the Iraqi people know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Gates, when asked about this timeline, provisions in the bill relating to Iraq, said it doesn't affect the troops adversely at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly the troops know we care about them. We give them everything they need. But last week, we entered the fifth year of this war. Think about that, the fifth year of this war, and there is no end in sight, I am sorry to say. The news this morning, when I first got up, was five more soldiers were killed yesterday,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>238 this year alone. March 26, 238 dead Americans, just like the boy Raul Bravo, from Elco, NV. I talked to his mother--237 just like that young man. Three thousand two hundred forty-one so far in this war--dead Americans--25,000  wounded. One hospital in Texas has handled 250 amputations. There are 2,000 double amputees as a result of this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war continues to move in the wrong direction and yet--instead of digging us out of the hole it created in Iraq--instead of stopping this downward spiral of destruction--instead of taking the fight to the terrorists who attacked us on September 11--this White House wants us to keep doing more of the same in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, President Bush said he would escalate the conflict and send 21,500 new troops for a few months. Of course, we were misled on that. We now know the number is around 30,000, and they will be there indefinitely, and the President has said he might ask for more troops. There is no short-term surge, as the President has described. It is more of the same. The President is placing troops in the middle of an Iraqi sectarian civil war. More military solutions to a problem that General Petraeus,  our top commander in Iraq, has said can only be solved politically. Our commander on the ground in Iraq has said that only 20 percent of it can be won militarily. That is not good enough for me. We need to find a new way forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the President will not listen to the generals, if he will not listen to the American people, who have spoken for a new direction, then perhaps he will listen to us, Congress, when we send him a supplemental bill that acknowledges reality in Iraq. We must find a new way forward. The President can swagger all he wants, but we have 3,241 dead Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraq measure in this bill changes the mission of U.S. troops from policing a civil war to counterterror, training, and force protection. It rejects the notion that this war can be won militarily, and it sets a goal of redeploying our troops by March 2008. It includes a requirement for a political, diplomatic, and economic strategy to be implemented in conjunction with the redeployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraq language is based on a simple premise: Iraq can be won only politically. In short, it offers a responsible strategy in Iraq that the American people asked for last November 7--a strategy that will enhance our country's ability to wage war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrary to what President Bush believes, the key to success in Iraq is not escalating the conflict by adding tens of thousands of additional troops to trod down the same dangerous road. It is to find a new way forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this supplemental. After 4 years of war, our troops deserve a strategy to help them complete the mission so they can come home.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to thank our leader for his comments about the progress that has been made in the Senate on issues that affect the working middle-class families of this country and also for his responses on the issue of the war in Iraq, where there should be an opportunity, as we focus on the particular amendment, to get into that in greater detail. But I thank him for his very worthwhile comments this afternoon.</paragraph>
