  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of the Kennedy amendment, the hate crimes amendment. Our Nation's strength lies in its diversity, its tolerance, its respect for the individual. Hate crimes borne of prejudice and ignorance, of fear and cowardice, contravene these core principles which our Nation for more than two centuries has held dear. They are perpetuated by individuals who fear, in some sense, individuality. Terrorism is a hate crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Kennedy, ensures that hate crimes be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. It enables Federal investigations of what are clearly Federal crimes. Hate crimes target individuals because they are part of a community. In the national community, all of us have a stake in fighting back against these crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague's amendment sends a strong message. The message is this: Our Nation will not turn the other way when individuals try to divide us. We will not tread softly when individuals use violence to perpetuate hatred. We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law crimes that reflect a vicious disregard for individual rights and our Nation's core central values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is a community of people who care about one another. Hate crimes destroy our cohesiveness and our mutual respect and replace those values with paranoia, with divisiveness, and with destruction. Hate crimes weaken our Nation. This amendment strengthens it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.</paragraph>
