  <narrative>PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1544]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Please state your inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is it true that the rule that was the subject of the motion of the gentleman from Ohio with respect to not holding a vote open for the purpose of changing votes was adopted by this Congress at the beginning of this Congress?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. Is it true that that rule was, in fact, a separate title and voted separately by this House by a vote of 430-0?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is not currently aware of the exact vote on that.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. Consistent with the rulings of the Chair last night, is it true that the only enforcement mechanism of that rule adopted by this House is a privileged resolution such as offered by the gentleman from Ohio?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. If such a privileged resolution is tabled, as was just done by this body, is it true that there is no alternative enforcement mechanism?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The minority leader's resolution, House Resolution 1039, was held to present a question of privilege and was considered as such. The will of the House was that it be laid on the table.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Is it available to other Members of this House who feel aggrieved by the vote last night to bring a privileged resolution similar to that brought by the gentleman from Ohio?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Yes, it is.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is it true, Mr. Speaker, that if individual Members brought such motion seriatim that that would not be considered dilatory but, rather, within the authority of each Member of this House as a separate and individual Member of this House?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair cannot render such an advisory opinion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. Is the enforcement mechanism referred to previously, exercised by the gentleman from Ohio, also available to other individual Members of this House?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Rule IX may be invoked by any Member of the House.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman may state his parliamentary inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is it correct that the motion just brought by the gentleman from Ohio was brought pursuant to rule IX and was on a question of the privileges of the House?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>And is it correct that that motion was then tabled and that was the action the House just took?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The minority leader's resolution (<bill type="hr" number="1039">H. Res. 1039</bill>) was held to present a question of privilege and was considered as such. The will of the House was that it be laid on the table.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry. If it had not been tabled, then it would have been debatable for 1 hour, is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair will not answer a hypothetical question. The majority leader's resolution was held to present a question of privilege and was considered as such. The will of the House was that it be laid on the table.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is it not true that earlier this year there have been questions of the privileges of the House where they have not been tabled and they have been debated for an hour?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair cannot serve as historian for the House, but the gentleman is correct that a question of privilege could be considered by the House.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>And could be debated for an hour?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> And could be debated.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is it not true that in the last Congress, the then minority leader and the now Speaker raised a similar question of the privileges of the House pursuant to rule IX after a vote was held open and that on that question of privileges of the House, in fact, the majority, the then majority, now minority, allowed a debate of an hour and that the conduct of the House in holding a vote open to change the result of the vote was debated for an hour?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> It is not the function of the Chair to render historical perspectives. The Member will have to look to the RECORD for that.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'm sorry. The gentleman is correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is not prepared to render historical perspectives. The Member will have to look at the Record for that answer.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>So the effect of immediately tabling the question of privileges raised by the gentleman from Ohio was to deny the minority the ability to debate that issue for an hour as was done when the same thing happened last Congress, is that correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> It is a summary, adverse disposition.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400368" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Please state your inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, is it not true that the last vote was called at 10:52?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is not prepared to give exact figures. The gentleman can look at the Record for that.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Please state your inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is it not true that the vote was closed at 11:22, which is approximately 30 minutes?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair is not prepared to render an historical perspective. The gentleman can look to the Record for that.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry. According to the Democrats' election manifesto, floor votes should be completed within 15 minutes with a customary 2-minute extension to accommodate Members' ability to reach the House Chamber to cast a vote. No vote shall be held open in order to manipulate the outcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Was that the rule that we passed on January 5, 2007?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> It is not appropriate for the Chair to render an opinion on a document of the nature cited by the Member.</chair>
