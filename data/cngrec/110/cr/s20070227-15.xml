  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my remarks about Senator Kennedy were for a happy occasion, but this is on a sad occasion. Last week--very close, actually, around the Senator's birthday--we lost our superintendent of education, Dr. Cecil Picard. Cecil Picard died prematurely of Lou Gehrig's disease, but he died in the arms of his loving wife of many years, surrounded by his children and his grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We knew for a time--and he knew, of course--that the disease that he had been diagnosed with 2 years earlier was going to be fatal. Although he fought it bravely and courageously, it took his life last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My husband, Frank Snellings, served on the board of elementary and secondary education, and I want to say publicly what an inspiration Dr. Picard was to us, to our family but, more importantly, what an outstanding leader he was in the area of education reform in a State that he loved, a community which he loved and in which he served as a teacher, principal, superintendent, and then as superintendent of education of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His passion and commitment to early childhood education was contagious. In fact, in the last several years of my knowing Dr. Picard, I never had a conversation with him when he did not mention this subject to me. He would say: Senator, when is the next meeting with the Department of Education? Senator, do the other Senators understand how important early childhood is to this country? Do they really understand that without this, our children will never be ready to learn and will never be able  to access the great benefits of the education infrastructure that we put</paragraph>
    <paragraph>together for them? Don't they understand?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to him: Cecil, unfortunately, they don't understand it the way you do. If everybody in this country had your passion and intellectual grasp of early childhood education, we would not be so grossly underfunded. Because of his work in Louisiana, we now have--and it is his legacy--LA4, Louisiana 4, which the majority--not all, not because of his lack of trying--our 4-year-olds in Louisiana are almost covered for early childhood opportunities. So when they show up and knock at that kindergarten  door and that teacher welcomes them with open arms, those children can sit down at that desk or at that table and open a book and begin to really grasp and understand the letters and the meanings of words because they have been taught up to that point how to get their education started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, learning those early language symbols and numbers and social interaction is so important in those early years. Cecil knew this. His life was committed to education, to being a leader and an advocate for children, a champion for the profession of teaching, with his enthusiasm and ability as a legislator, which is where I met him as a State senator and as a legislator before he was a superintendent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as a father, a grandfather, a coach, a teacher, a principal, a senator, and as an education advocate, we cannot say strongly enough in Louisiana that we have truly lost a champion. We have truly lost someone who, in my lifetime, probably cannot be replaced. Hopefully, another Cecil Picard will come along, but they are few and far between.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wanted to say on behalf of the 4.5 million people I represent--and I can say this without fear of being contradicted--that he will be missed, but his legacy will be long remembered, not only in our hearts and minds but in the way people live. His legacy will be reflected in their life, in their productivity, and their contributions to our State and to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
