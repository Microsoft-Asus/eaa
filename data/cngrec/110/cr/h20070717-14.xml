    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Robert Causor, Jr., a paratrooper rifleman with the 82nd Airborne Division who was killed July 7 by a homemade bomb in Samarra, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robert was born and grew up in San Jose, California. Since childhood, he dreamed of being a soldier, and after graduating from Overfelt High School he enlisted to serve in Iraq. Despite worries from his family, Robert was determined to fulfill his lifelong dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Robert, service in the military was a way to repay his country for the successes of his family. He came from a close family, one of 26 cousins who lived in San Jose for over three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of California's 16th Congressional District, I offer Robert's family our deepest condolences as they deal with this painful loss. He will be decorated with many honors, including a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, but today our thoughts and our prayers are with his parents, the rest of his family and his friends.</paragraph>
