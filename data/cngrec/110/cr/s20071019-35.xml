  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, Monday night--my announcement to everyone here today--could be that we have a significant number of votes. It is very likely we will certainly have more than one vote and we hope that vote will start around 5:30. Senators HARKIN and SPECTER have worked together and their staffs have worked together trying to come up with what they can clear. They have Monday during the day to work on this also. We are going to try to clear most everything out Monday night  so we can finish the bill Tuesday, as agreed upon.</paragraph>
