  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in just a matter of weeks, thousands of Mexican trucks will stream across America's southern border and pour onto U.S. highways throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Department of Transportation has given 100 Mexican trucking companies the green light to unleash an unlimited number of trucks onto the highways of America as part of a 1-year pilot program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, Mexican trucks are only permitted to travel inside a 25-mile commercial zone along the U.S. border, but, soon, thousands of Mexican trucks will have full access to all the Nation's roads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allowing low-paid drivers and substandard trucks to travel our Nation's roads will endanger the safety of American citizens. It will cost thousands of American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an extension of NAFTA, this program is just another example of U.S. trade policies that fail American workers. Before NAFTA, our Nation ran a trade surplus with Mexico. Now, the U.S. runs a $65 billion annual trade deficit with Mexico. The U.S. has lost 3 million manufacturing jobs in just the past 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Launching this pilot program in the name of free trade is just one more example of how our government continues to give away American jobs. This program will not only hurt the economy but will put our national security at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Transportation claims that all of these Mexican trucks will be inspected by U.S. officials in Mexico and at the border, but, Mr. Speaker, less than 10 percent of all Mexican trucks entering the commercial zone are inspected now, only 10 percent. The U.S. cannot afford to send inspectors to Mexico when only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of U.S. truck companies are inspected each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With no guaranteed way to inspect the cargo of each and every truck, this program could easily aid terrorist activities, the entry of illegal drugs and illegal human smuggling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the sake of appeasing Mexico, our government is not protecting the national security of this country and the future of our economy. This program does nothing but endanger the safety of American citizens, and it is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the American people will continue to contact this administration to tell them of their outrage and disappointment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I close, this is from a heading in an eastern North Carolina paper that says, "Bush Decision on Mexican Trucks Promotes Era." People are upset and mad. I want to read just very briefly, "The news that Mexican trucks will be allowed to haul freight deep into the United States drew angry reaction Friday from labor leaders, safety advocates and Members of Congress." They said, "Mexico has substandard trucks and low-paid drivers that will threaten national security, cost  thousands of jobs and endanger motorists on the northern side of the Mexican border."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the people of this great Nation will listen to these discussions and debates by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, because if we are concerned about national security, we should not allow these trucks to have free access to the roads of the American people.</paragraph>
