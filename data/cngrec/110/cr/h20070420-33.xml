    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week I had the pleasure of attending a middle school in my congressional district. The middle school is Woodbury. I have a T-shirt to represent Woodbury Middle School. I thought I could wear it on the floor of the House, but they told me it was inappropriate attire so I had to take it off. But this is a Woodbury T-shirt, and I promised those students at Woodbury Middle School that this week on the floor of the House I would talk about what a great time I  had at Woodbury Middle School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I was there, and let me recognize the principal, Barbara Whitaker; the vice principals, WeMet Smith and Eric Grundton; and teacher friends of mine, my neighbor, Barbara Norton; Chante Taylor, who is the wife of one of my district staffers; Aisha Mason, who is the wife of Senator Lance Mason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I was there for we have Ohio achievement tests, and we decided on this particular day at this particular school, we are going to celebrate the achievements of the young people of Woodbury Middle School. We had a wonderful time. The band played. They are doing a production of "Annie," and "Annie" did a production. We had a dance troupe that I learned how to do a certain dance with these young people. We even had a chance to quote Nas, a famous rapper, who talks about I can be what  I want to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a great time. We had a wonderful chance to really celebrate the fact that these young people are going to do a great job on this Ohio achievement test. So Woodbury Middle School, I keep my promise. Hurray for Woodbury Middle School. Pass that test.</paragraph>
