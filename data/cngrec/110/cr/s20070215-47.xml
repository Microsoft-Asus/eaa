    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week our country and the State of Massachusetts lost a favorite son. Antonio Pierro passed away last week at the age of 110. Today would have been his 111th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Guinness World Records has said that Pierro was America's oldest war veteran, having served in World War I, and the oldest American man in its records. Only seven veterans of WWI are still known to be alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pierro was born in Italy in 1896 and lived there before he immigrated to the United States in 1914. Only 3 short years later, he was drafted into the Army and sent to France to fight in WWI. Pierro was given the opportunity to fight for the Italians, an ally of the United States, but instead chose to fight for his new homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once his service was completed he followed his father and brothers back to Swampscott, MA and spent the rest of his life as a resident of the Bay State. His love for America was evident to all of those he met. His nephew, Richard Pierro said, "When he left Italy, he left for good. This was the promised land. He didn't want to go back, even if you offered him free passage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pierro worked at a shoe plant, managed a body shop and eventually spent 17 years at General Electric in Lynn until his retirement, 46 years ago, in 1961. His family attributes his longevity to his strict adherence to three square meals a day and lots of sleep. Pierro lived by simple rules of life and remained dedicated to leading a simple, good life until the day he passed. His is remembered as having a "twinkle in his eye" and a gratitude for all that life had offered him. He lived in three  different centuries, and he lived well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask that we remember him today as a veteran, a true American, and a testament to life's many gifts and surprises. Our country is honored by his service but also thankful for the lessons his life offers about patriotism, family, and the simple pleasures of life.</paragraph>
