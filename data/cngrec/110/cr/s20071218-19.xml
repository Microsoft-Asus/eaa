    <paragraph>Mr. President, the point I was making is this: It is easy to lose sight of the larger objective when we get down into the details of specific legislation, as we must do. It is important to understand it and to get it right, but we also have to keep our eye on the ball. To mix metaphors, you have to look at the forest and not get drawn down into the trees too much. The forest here is a very dangerous enemy which means to do us harm. They have the means to do it. They have the will to do it. We  are fighting them in two different kinds of conflicts. We are fighting them in hot war in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is a serious proposition. Young men and women have been sent to these places to do battle, to lay their lives on the line to carry out the mission</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot send them to do this job without being willing to provide them the funding they need to sustain their effort. Part of the debate today is ensuring that at least for the next 4 months, they will have enough money to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the same token, we have an enemy all over the world, including in the United States, which is plotting, our intelligence community assesses with high confidence, to carry out a devastating attack if they have the opportunity to do so. It is critical that we use the assets we have available to collect intelligence against these organizations and people wherever they are. The best way to defeat the radical Islamists who mean to do us harm is to prevent it in the first place. That is what good  intelligence allows us. That is why it is important for us to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is, on two of the great issues that are before us today, we have a violent enemy that needs to be defeated. The best way to do that is to support our troops and our intelligence agencies and the men and women who are carrying out the missions we have asked of them in defeating this enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to understand the threat and understand that in America, in this great democratic Republic of ours, the American people are the center of gravity in any war. It is their support that is needed in order to achieve victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our young men and women on the battlefield and our people serving us in the intelligence community are counting on us, the representatives of the American people, to see to it that they have what they need to carry out their missions.</paragraph>
