  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is a big day today. Our three Presidentials are going to be here, and we have a 5:45 vote. We are looking forward to that. We don't see them as much as we used to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following my remarks today and those of the Republican leader, there will be an hour of morning business, equally divided, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. The majority will control the first half and the Republicans will control the second half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as under the previous order. Rollcall votes may occur throughout the day in relation to FISA amendments. As I mentioned, there will be a 5:45 p.m. cloture vote on the Finance Committee amendment to the economic stimulus. Second-degree amendments to the finance amendment are due by 4 p.m. today.</paragraph>
