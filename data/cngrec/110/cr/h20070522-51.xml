  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I didn't have planned remarks, but then again, I didn't think what we just witnessed would take place today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had heard for 1 1/2  years, 2 years, that if the Democratic Party got the majority in this House, we would have the most bipartisan Congress ever. We were told there would be no earmarks if the Democratic majority took control of this House. There would be all love and affection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, of course, we saw how procedural rules went early this year, had things crammed down our throats, no chance for amendments, no participation, no committee involvement. Then we have a threat, an unrefuted allegation of a threat over earmarks. Unbelievable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This party that was going to be so bipartisan will not even let discussion take place over whether or not a threat occurred. This House is falling down around the majority's promises.</paragraph>
