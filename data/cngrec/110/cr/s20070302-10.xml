    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join the majority leader in commending Mr. Morton for his extraordinary service in the Senate. Not only does he love the Redskins, he loves to fish, too--two passions I share with him. I expect he will have more time for both in the coming years. I join with my good friend, the majority leader, in thanking him for his remarkable career in the Senate and for helping us in so many ways over the years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, the Republican leader, I don't know how anyone could care more for athletic teams than he does for those in Kentucky. I am not sure he has a lot of time to share any of his affection for teams other than those in Kentucky because they are a passion of the distinguished Republican leader.</paragraph>
