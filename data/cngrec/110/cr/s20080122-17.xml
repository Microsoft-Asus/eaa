    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to mention and thank specifically our Chaplain, ADM Barry Black, for coming to Arizona this past weekend to join in celebrations relating to the Martin Luther King activities that occurred. After preaching three sermons and attending a couple other major events associated with Martin Luther King celebrations, Chaplain Black was right back here to open our session today. He certainly deserves our thanks and has my gratitude for joining us in Arizona.</paragraph>
