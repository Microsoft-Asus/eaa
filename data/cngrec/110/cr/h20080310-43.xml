  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Thursday, March 13, 2008, the International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight Subcommittee will conduct a hearing on "War Powers for the 21st Century: The Congressional Perspective." I would like to thank Chairman Bill Delahunt and Ranking Member Dana Rohrabacher for scheduling this hearing. It is my understanding that Chairman Delahunt and Ranking Member Rohrabacher also plan to hold two additional  war powers hearings during the month of April.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely grateful for their interest in this very important issue. Along with former Congressmen David Skaggs and Mickey Edwards, who are cochairmen of the Constitutional Projects War Powers Initiative, this Thursday I will testify on the legislation I introduced in October of 2007, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, <bill type="hj" number="53">H.J. Res. 53</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too many times this Congress has abdicated its constitutional duty by allowing Presidents to overstep their executive authority. Our Constitution states that while the Commander-in-Chief has the power to conduct wars, only Congress has the power to authorize war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is for this reason that in 1999 I joined 16 of my colleagues in Congress to file a suit against President Clinton for unconstitutionally conducting offensive military attacks against Yugoslavia without obtaining a declaration of war or other explicit authorizations from Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as threats to international peace and security continue to evolve, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, <bill type="hj" number="53">H.J. Res. 53</bill>, rededicates Congress to its primary constitutional role of deciding when to use force abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1793, James Madison said, " ..... The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature ..... the executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Framers of our Constitution sought to decentralize the war powers of the United States and construct a balance between the political branches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The War Powers Resolution of 1973 aimed to clarify the intent of the constitutional Framers and to ensure that Congress and the President share in the decision-making process in the event of armed conflict. Yet, since the enactment of the resolution, time and again Presidents have maintained that the resolution's consultation, reporting, and congressional authorization requirements are unconstitutional obstacles to executive authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By more fully clarifying the war powers of the President and the Congress, the legislation I've introduced, <bill type="hj" number="53">H.J. Res. 53</bill>, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, improves upon the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in a number of ways. It clearly spells out the powers that the Congress and the President must exercise collectively, as well as the defensive measures the Commander in Chief may exercise without congressional approval. It also provides a more robust reporting requirement that would enable  Congress to be more informed and to have greater oversight. And it protects and preserves the checks and balances the Framers intended in the decision to bring our Nation into war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I look forward to congressional hearings on this critical issue. The time for Congress to meet its constitutional duty is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Madam Speaker, I would like to ask God to continue to bless our men and women in Afghanistan and Iraq, and to ask God to continue to bless the families of our men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
