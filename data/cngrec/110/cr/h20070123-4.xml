    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what if I were to tell you that non-Members of the House of Representatives were about to be given a vote right here in the House? You would say no, can't happen, right? Well, hold on, because it's about to happen and it's about to happen this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week is a remarkable week; it should be a time of great anticipation, the State of the Union, we've got incredible and remarkable challenges that face our Nation. But at home, when I go home, people are kind of wondering out loud, what's going on up there in Washington? There is skepticism about the Six for '06, you know, the things that the Democrat majority adopted in their vaunted first 100 hours, albeit under an unfair process and with no input from either their new Members or the minority.  Really a clear abuse of power. But the explanation was, well, we ran on these issues, everyone knew they were coming, they endorsed them in the election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, regardless of the truthfulness of that statement, most folks just kind of shake their head, and most in the press have given the Democrats the benefit of the doubt, and that's all right. There is a basic sense of, you know, it's tough to believe that they would violate so many principles coming right out of the chute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then yesterday we had a suspension bill; that is a bill that is brought to the floor of the House that requires a supermajority, two-thirds, in order to pass. And by tradition, it is brought to the floor because it has got an overwhelming amount of support, with the full knowledge of both the majority and the minority. And yesterday, a bill that virtually everyone here supports, removing Federal pensions from Members of Congress who are convicted of a felony, was brought to the floor and  amended or changed twice within a few minutes before even reaching the floor. Now this is fairly esoteric stuff; however, it is important because it demonstrates the unfair process, the abuse of the rules and the abuse of power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now we have another in what seems to be this daily event of power-hungry Democrat majorities to give non-Members of the House a vote on this floor. It is a move that they tried the last time they were in control, a move that generated some interesting headlines--"Have the Democrats No Shame?" "The Democrats' Greedy Power Grab," "Power Grab in the House." And these are from the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Post, not this year, but in 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the issue is whether or not to allow non-Members of the House of Representatives, specifically the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, and the Delegates from Guam, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia and American Samoa the privilege to vote during the Committee of the Whole on this floor of the House. Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous; it is an incredible, phenomenal move in both process and in substance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, now becoming the routine, this bill, scheduled to come to the floor of the House tomorrow, has had no committee hearing, no debate, no opportunity to amend, no democracy. I assure you, this is not the kind of change that the American people voted for last November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution states that the House shall be composed of, quote, "Members chosen by the people of the several States," not Delegates representing non-State territories. It is an unconstitutional power grab, a plan that runs roughshod over the constitutional principle of one person, one vote. One of these territories has 57,000 residents, compared to the 650,000 in my district. These individuals could vote to raise your taxes, Mr. Speaker, without paying taxes themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly the plot by the Democrats is to slip this through during the week of the State of the Union when they think no one is paying attention. This is an unconscionable action, it is a violation of trust and a clear abuse of power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Democrat plot and logic, they could seat and allow anyone that the majority desires in the House. Who's next, Mr. Speaker? Howard Dean? Does he get a vote in the House?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are disgusted with this level of arrogance and abuse of power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oath that all of us took just a few weeks ago, we all pledged to uphold the Constitution of the United States; this proposal belies that oath.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my Democrat colleagues to regain some sense of propriety, some sense of history, some sense of rectitude. When you trample on the Constitution, when you use the Constitution as a doormat and not the foundational document of our wonderful representative democracy, you do great harm to our Nation.</paragraph>
