  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3273">S3273</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, under the rules of the Senate, 1 hour after we come in there is an automatic cloture vote. Tonight, it is on <bill type="h" number="2831">H.R. 2831</bill>, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I ask unanimous consent that both sides have a full half hour. I designate Senator Kennedy to appropriate the time however he feels appropriate. Following the usage of that 1 hour, I ask unanimous consent that Senator McConnell, if he wishes to speak, be recognized using leader time and following his  remarks, that I be recognized in leader time prior to the vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to all Senators within the sound of my voice, after we complete work on this legislation, Senator McConnell and I are trying to work to inform everyone what the schedule will be in the future--that is, this evening, tomorrow, Friday, and the beginning of next week. We do not have that worked out yet, but we are getting very close.</paragraph>
