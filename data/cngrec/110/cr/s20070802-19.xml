    <paragraph>While my friend, the distinguished chairman of the committee, is not here, the ranking member is here. I think we all owe you a debt of gratitude. The way this bill was managed has been exemplary, and I speak for all of us in extending my appreciation to you and your partner in this very important committee, Senator Baucus, for the work you have done.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would thank the distinguished majority leader too because he allowed this process to work. All the amendments that needed to come up--and there was kind of a convoluted way of putting it together with the tax bill that opened up a lot of other avenues and amendments that were brought up. But it really worked out well, and it is in the tradition of the Senate, and I thank you very much for your leniency in regard to letting everything that needed to be discussed, be discussed.  I appreciate that.</paragraph>
