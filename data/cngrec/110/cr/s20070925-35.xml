    <paragraph>Mr. President, is there a pending amendment?</paragraph>

  <chair> There are amendments to the motion to commit with instructions.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Other than those amendments that filled up the tree, there are no pending amendments; is that correct?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are trying to work out a unanimous consent agreement so we can vote on the amendment of the Senator from Delaware, hopefully, at 5:30. We are attempting to work out a unanimous consent agreement. We do not have it yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will suggest, if the Senator from Delaware is willing, because there is a reasonable chance we are going to get there, that he now describe his amendment and offer his amendment, and then--he cannot technically offer it, but he can describe his amendment--and, hopefully, we can get a unanimous consent agreement. If we do, he could then technically offer it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would suggest that without offering his amendment, the Senator from Delaware describe his amendment, debate his amendment, in the hopes we can get a unanimous consent agreement to vote on that amendment at 5:30. We do not have it yet, but we are working on it.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Delaware.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am happy to do that. I see the former distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee is on the floor. Let me say at the outset how much I appreciate both him and the chairman of the committee for making some very constructive suggestions as to how to amend my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the appropriate time, I will call up the amendment and move for its modification. But I want to, at the outset, tell the Senator from Virginia how much I appreciate his leadership. The truth is, he and I had a fairly extensive colloquy on the floor last week on this amendment. True to his word, the Senator said he was going to take a look at this amendment, he was seriously interested in it, and he wanted to look at it. As is always the case with the Senator from Virginia, he kept his word.  He not only kept his word, but he improved what Senator Brownback and I and Senator Boxer and others had come forward with. Again, at the appropriate time, I will move to amend Biden-Brownback along those lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, as I understood it, there was the possibility that if we had gotten the unanimous consent agreement, there would be 15 minutes on a side. I know a number of people want to speak. I had an opportunity to speak on this amendment at length last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My distinguished colleague from California, who I must say--and I am sure my colleagues will fully appreciate this--we would not have gotten to this point were it not for the Senator from California. Her embrace of this approach well over a year ago, quite frankly, legitimized this in a way on my side of the aisle that no one else, quite frankly, could have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that it has such, at this point--and, God willing, as my grandfather would say, and the "crick" not rising--hopefully, when we vote, it will bear out what I am about to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has genuine bipartisan support but not merely bipartisan support. This has genuine support that crosses ideological divides as narrow or as wide as they are in this body. I think that is a very hopeful sign for the emergence of a policy in Iraq that would give us some real opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Chair's permission and my colleagues' permission, I would like to yield the floor to my colleague from California, if she would like to speak to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, are we awaiting, hopefully, an agreement at this point? We are speaking on the bill in general? Is that where we are?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will indulge me for about 5 or 6 minutes while I speak about the Biden-Brownback-Boxer-Specter, and many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, amendment. I wish to say to my colleague from Delaware how much I appreciate what he has done. In the face of so much opposition, he has kept to this idea that we need to respect the Iraqis enough to understand the reality of their situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember before we had the vote on whether to go to war, or give the President the authority to go to war, a friend of mine, former Congressman John Burton, called me and said: Barbara, I want you to read one book before you cast your vote, one book that I think explains what Iraq is about. That book is entitled "The Reckoning," and it was written by someone named Sandra Mackey, a historian, in 2002. So I read the book before we voted on whether to give the President authority to  go into Iraq. The book detailed how Saddam Hussein egregiously used his power as a brutal dictator and a strongman to hold that country together. She explains the history of Iraq and why the only way to hold it together, in her view, was by such a strongman and what a terrible reality she came to. She said that after World War I, Iraq was a young, fragile country, patched together by the victorious European powers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within its artificial boundaries, the Iraqis have lived for eight decades as a collection of competing families, tribes, regions, tongues, and faiths. This complex, multilayered mosaic of Arabs and nonArabs, Muslims, and Christians, is trisected by Iraq's three major population groups, each in possession of a distinct identity; each group dominates a region of Iraq--the Sunnis the center, the Shia the south, the Kurds the north.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She goes on to conclude:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq is a state, not a nation. Over the 80 years of their common history, the Iraqis have engaged in the conflicted, and at times convoluted search for a common identity. But Iraqis as a whole have never reached consensus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What Senator Biden has understood for several years now, and why I was so interested in supporting him from the very start as a proud member of his Foreign Relations Committee, is we have to deal with the Iraq we have, not the Iraq we wish we had. If that sounds similar to someone--I understand that is a similar sentence. But we don't have an Iraq that we romantically wish we had. After all, as Senator Biden has said many times, for Iraq to survive and thrive, they have to want  democracy as much as we want it for them. I think that quote by Senator Biden has been in my mind since the very start of this war that I did not vote for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I see a light at the end of a very dark tunnel--a darkness that is impacting our Nation. It is impacting the Senate in a way where we are paralyzed. We can't get from A to B; we can't see this light. We can't grab it. We argue over military tactics such as a surge. Our military has done everything we have asked them to do. But every single military leader and political leader has told us there is only one solution, and it is a diplomatic one. In this very important amendment, what Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kurds are running their own lives. They even fly the Kurdish flag. They make their own decisions. I think worth repeating is this solution we are putting before the Senate today--we hope it is today--recognizes the Iraqis will decide this for themselves, that this idea is consistent with the Constitution, not outside their Constitution. Of course, they will be the ones who have to embrace this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what this amendment does is it says to the world we are ready to move past a military solution. We understand we are not going to have lasting  peace when all you have on the table is a gun and bullets. We have to put a diplomatic solution on the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am very delighted to have this time now. I don't know if I will have any time later to speak, but I have said what I need to say. I think this is a golden moment for us. I think we could move this debate in a better direction, in a direction all of us want to move it, whether we are Republicans or Democrats, whether we voted for the war or not. We want to craft some type of political solution. We want a roadmap. The Senator from Delaware has given it to us. I am proud to be a part of this  bipartisan group that has cosponsored this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues, the Senator from California and the Senator from Delaware. They are making a sincere effort to find a way out of this terrible morass we are in, in Iraq. I can recall 5 years ago when we were called on to vote to give an authorization for the use of force to President Bush. It was in October, before an election a few weeks away, and there were some who argued the President would never use that force. There were some who argued he would  use it immediately. Unfortunately, history has proven he used it in a few months. We now find ourselves enmeshed in a war we never bargained for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That authorization for the use of force said it was for the purpose of deposing a dictator and destroying weapons of mass destruction that threatened the United States. The dictator is gone, the weapons of mass destruction never existed. Yet we are still there and 3,800 American soldiers have been killed so far, 30,000 injured, and 10,000 grievously injured. The numbers rise by the day. At one hundred a month, American soldiers die. There is violence on the streets. Attempts to have meetings  for cooperation and compromise are cut short by bombs and bullets. It is a situation which we never bargained for, and this President has no concept of how to extricate America from that morass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call to the attention of the Senate, though, not the Biden-Brownback amendment, which I will speak to at a later time but, rather, an amendment offered by Senators Lieberman and Kyl. It is an amendment which relates to a country next to Iraq--Iran. Iran is a dangerous country. Yesterday, there was a lot of controversy about whether its President should be allowed to speak at a major university in the United States. Many argued he should not have. Whatever your opinion on whether  he should have been allowed to speak, when it was all said and done, when he had finished his speaking, there was no doubt in my mind that it was pretty clear how radical and unreliable he is. Some of the things he said were preposterous, outrageous, and didn't reflect the truth as we know</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have joined with Senator Gordon Smith in a bipartisan resolution applying economic pressure and diplomacy to change the Iranian policies that might lead to nuclear armaments. I believe that is our first order of business and a high priority for the United States. That is why I joined him in that resolution. In fact, in the past, I voted for resolutions by Senator Lieberman and others acknowledging the potential threat of Iran. I think we should be forewarned that this is a  dangerous country, until they change their ways and perhaps change their leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to commend to every Senator before the vote on the Lieberman-Kyl amendment that they take a few moments and read it. There is a paragraph in this amendment which I find troubling, if not frightening. I wish to read it into the Record. I will concede this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment and doesn't have the force of law, but I want my colleagues to understand what they are voting for if they decide that a vote for the Lieberman-Kyl amendment is a vote against Iran. I will read  it as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the sense of the Senate--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now I read from paragraph 4 in the Lieberman-Kyl amendment, and I quote verbatim from the latest version I have--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>to support the prudent and calibrated use of all instruments of United States national power in Iraq, including diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military instruments, in support of the policy described in paragraph (3) with respect to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its proxies. &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see the Senator from Connecticut is on the floor. If this language has been deleted or changed, I hope he will bring to it my attention, because as written and as read, the language that I have been given is troubling. Conceding this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, we are, in fact, saying we support the use of military instruments in Iran. What does that mean? Does that mean we are supporting the invasion of Iran, that we are supporting military tactics against Iran? Shouldn't we be extra  careful in the language of these amendments when we find that the authorization of force for Iraq has dragged us into a war now in its fifth year, a war longer than World War II, with bloody and deadly consequences for the United States and innocent Iraqis?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't vote for this language as read. If it has been changed or will be changed, I am ready to talk, because I certainly have no defense of Iran and its intrigue, its activities, and its plans that we understand to be the development of nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said, I have joined with Senator Smith encouraging economic and diplomatic sanctions against Iran, but this amendment goes beyond that. I repeat:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) to support the prudent and calibrated use of all instruments of United States national power in Iraq, including diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military instruments, in support of the policy described in paragraph (3) with respect to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its proxies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is entirely too expansive. It is dangerous language. Those who vote for it are going on the Record for the use of military power in a way that I don't think they fully comprehend. Again, if this is being changed, if it is going to be changed before the vote, then I will concede that many items before the Senate are works in progress. But as written and as read, I cannot accept this language. I think it is a dangerous effort to put us on the record for the use of military  force in Iran. Even if we are militarily capable of doing that today--and some question whether we are--the simple fact is there is a process to call for congressional approval under our Constitution before we declare war on any Nation. This, unfortunately, takes us down that road toward that goal in a way that I think is unacceptable, and for that reason I will oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Biden amendment, and I hope we are going to proceed with a vote on this amendment. I am an original cosponsor. I appreciate what Senator Biden has brought forward. He has talked about the semiautonomous region in Iraq for a long time--for over a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, so have I. I, too, have written an op-ed piece that says let's look at a long-term solution. I think we saw from General Petraeus in the last couple of weeks that we should be so proud of our military and what we have done to give security to the Iraqi people. It is not perfect, and it is not finished, but it is so much better than it has been before. Violence is down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, everybody who has been to Iraq, including myself and most Members of the Senate, can see clearly that American forces securing Iraq is not a long-term solution. We must have an Iraq that has an economic and a political solution. I don't think you can have a political solution if you don't have an economy, if people don't have jobs, if they cannot start small businesses, if they cannot take their children to school. You are not going to be able to have a long-term solution without  the building of an economy and a political base. That is why I support this amendment, why I am an  original cosponsor with so many Republicans and Democrats coming together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about their view of the war, I differ with them about what we should do militarily. But I do think all of us are coming together to say we should have a long-term solution with fewer American troops in a support role, not a frontline role. The way to do that is to have an economy and political stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what I think the Biden amendment would suggest. We are not telling the Iraqi people what to do. They passed their own law to implement it. They have a much longer history there than we do. I think we should continue to promote this as a solution. I think we need to do a few other things in conjunction with this. I think we should work more closely with Iraq's neighbors. I think the Bush administration is doing that now. I think the Secretary of State is doing a great job of bringing the  neighbors in and saying: You have a stake here, and certainly it is in everyone's interest in the region to have a stable Iraq that is not a terrorist breeding ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That should be pursued with the idea that they could also be helpful in regions that would work in a semiautonomous way. It is federalism with states that have their own self-governance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Henry Kissinger, in an appearance before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sympathetic to an outcome that permits large regional autonomy. In fact, I think it is very likely that this will emerge out of the conflict that we are now witnessing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Kissenger went on to say, in a Washington Post op-ed last week:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is possible that the present structure in Baghdad is incapable of national reconciliation because its elected constituents were elected on a sectarian basis. A wiser course would be to concentrate on the three principal regions and promote technocratic, efficient and humane administration in each. ..... More efficient regional government leading to substantial decrease in the level of violence, to progress towards the rule of law and to functioning markets could then, over a period of time,  give the Iraqi people an opportunity for national reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our efforts in the Balkans are instructive here. A little over 10 years ago, from 1992 to 1995, the war in the Balkans left 250,000 people dead and millions homeless. The Dayton Peace Accords ended that conflict. The agreement retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries and created a joint multiethnic and democratic government charged with a very narrow power--to conduct foreign, diplomatic, and fiscal policy. That is the overarching national government of Bosnia  and Herzegovina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a second tier of government there now, comprised of two entities that are roughly equal in size. The Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republica Srpska. The Federation and the Srpska governments oversee most government functions. Since the Dayton Peace Accords was signed, the guns of Bosnia have been silent. More than a million people have returned to their prewar homes. The success in Bosnia has enabled the number of U.S. troops in the region  to decline substantially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of 1995, there were 20,000 U.S. combat troops in the Bosnia region. I visited those troops seven times. The first time I went into Bosnia it was undercover. We had on flack jackets and helmets because the Serbs were shooting from the hills. In 2006, there were 600 American troops in Bosnia. Today, there are no combat troops in Bosnia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think this should be a model for Iraq. I think we could have a national government that divides the oil royalties, that has the diplomatic function that represents Iraq internationally, and the national government could be a mixture, as it is today. But then you would have semiautonomous regions. We talked about it. You have Kurdistan in the north, the Shia area in the south, and the middle doesn't have to be one region. I have heard the disagreements about the ability to put  that middle into one region because there are Shia and Sunnis in neighborhood to neighborhood. It will be more difficult, but it is also the best opportunity for a long-term solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why not have smaller units across the middle of Baghdad? Why not have some smaller government with an educational system, with the religious sect that is the majority in that sector?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is so important that we produce more options. Many of the best scholars in this country, the best writers in newspapers in our country, and many of the best diplomats in our country have said this is a potential solution. Some people in this category have said this isn't our first choice. Our first choice is to be a national government that is mixed--that works. That is all of our first choice. But that isn't the choice we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to recognize that we could not mold a country so quickly after thousands of years of strife along ethnic grounds. So we have to step back, in my opinion, and ask what could work to stabilize this country so that an economic and a political solution will work. With all of the people who are now saying this is an option that should be on the table, I hear people saying, in the end, that is probably the way it is going to be. That is where I come in and say: In the end? Wait a minute. We  have a chance to push for leadership now. We have a chance to bring the others in the region together now, so that the American troops who have done such a wonderful job will have two victories. One is that their mission will be accomplished in the right way; two, all of the sacrifices they have made will not be for naught. We cannot walk away from Iraq. We cannot say it is too tough, we are going to surrender. That would make all of the sacrifices that have been made irrelevant. We cannot</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need to talk about this anymore. The Iraqis have adopted it in their constitution. They have adopted the implementation of the legislation. With some leadership among all of its neighbors in the region, along with the United States and our allies who have given so much in this cause, we can protect future generations of Americans from attacks. We will have built a stable country, which is what we said we wanted to do when we went in to take out Saddam Hussein, who was abusing his people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, some may call for surrender, but that is not the answer. The answer is to promote a real solution that is a long-term solution; that is, allowing the Iraqis to draw their own regions, where they can grow an economy and a government that works along the Bosnian model, and we will be able to stay strong and do the right thing and listen to what people are saying. But that doesn't mean we have to wait and say, oh, that is what is going to happen in the end. Well, how many American  lives are going to be lost between now and the end? Let's allow our American troops to take the support role instead of the frontline role, as General Petraeus has started so ably. Let's do what is right for the Iraqi people and the Middle East region as well because a terrorist haven is not in anyone's interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment of which I am a cosponsor, along with a solid Republican and Democratic list of Members who are willing to stand up and say we want this war to end honorably, we want to complete the mission honorably, and we can do it in the right way. And that is to allow them to create their government, which would have a national overlay. The time is now, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand there is no time agreement; is that right?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak with respect to the Biden amendment. I listened carefully to the Senator from Texas, and I must say I  agreed with a lot of what she said. One thing I violently disagreed with was the notion at the end where she said some may call for surrender. I have not heard any U.S. Senator call for surrender. I think that is part of the sloganeering and talk, unfortunately, that has characterized some of the divisions as  people try to find a sensible way of finding success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are different views about how you find success here. The notion of setting a date and requiring leverage out of the Iraqi Government to do what it is not doing today is an alternative way of getting them to make those decisions and be successful in this endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also, in the view of many people in the Senate, a more effective way of supporting the troops, of honoring their sacrifice with a policy that we believe can actually achieve what their sacrifice is being made for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I caution colleagues about falling into the easy terminology about "choosing to lose," "surrender," "walking away," and so forth. When we leave the President of the United States discretion, as the Levin-Reed and other Senators', myself included, amendment did, you are leaving the President the discretion to continue to fight al-Qaida, you are leaving the President the discretion to finish standing up the Iraqi troops with training that is necessary to do that, and you are leaving the President  full discretion to protect American forces and facilities and interests. What other purpose could there be to be in Iraq 5 1/2  years after the start of war, which is when the date would, in fact, have cut in to leverage their change?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not what we are here; in some ways, that is what we are here to debate. Specifically, that is not what we are debating about now because this is a Biden amendment which is a different amendment. I wish to speak to it for a moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have resisted what has previously been put forward as a partition plan because I don't think the United States of America can just walk in and "partition." I think that would, in fact, smack of precisely part of the ingredients that have created the problem we inherited. That is what Winston Churchill and the British did shortly after the turn of the last century. The result was that they drew a lot of artificial lines between different people and created a state that never existed before,  and we are inheriting some of the long-term impact and realities of those decisions. So we cannot come in and just partition it, which is why for over 3 years or more I have been pushing for a standing conference, a summit, a peace conference which brings the permanent five and the neighbors and the Iraqi factions that are struggling all to the table simultaneously to work through diplomacy in order to arrive at an understanding of how they can go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Diplomacy has always been the key to trying to find a political settlement in Iraq. It has been absent. One of the reasons I am now a cosponsor of this different amendment by Senator Biden and others is that it does not specifically seek to partition. Not for the long term, certainly, and not even in the short term does it seek to partition. What it seeks to do is honor what is already in the Iraqi Constitution as well as recognize the realities that have developed on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some 2 million-plus people have been displaced out of the country, some 1.1 million people are displaced within the country, and there has been an ethnic cleansing taking place over the course of the last few years that has resulted, for instance, in the city of Baghdad transitioning from a city that at the beginning of the war was 65 percent Sunni to now it is 75 percent Shia, and the south is almost exclusively Shia, and the Sunni triangle is the Sunni triangle, with some exceptions, obviously.  We know there are intermarriages. There are some pockets of places where there are still larger populations of either Sunni or Shia living in a larger either Sunni or Shia surrounded area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the bottom line is this: There has been a huge shifting of populations according to ethnic lines that has taken place. There also is an awareness that there is fundamentally a failed government, almost failed state. Everyone, from President Bush to Prime Minister Maliki to General Petraeus, everybody involved with this at a decisionmaking level has acknowledged that there is no military solution, there is only a political solution. So if there is no military solution and there is only a political  solution, what is the political solution? Clearly, the political solution--because we have seen over the last 4 1/2  years it is not going to be immediately, maybe down the road but not immediately--to have a strong central functioning government that somehow has the ability to work through the differences of Shia and Sunni divisions with a police that is dysfunctional and an army that is largely Shia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the reasons the Sunni in Anbar have decided to fight al-Qaida and to join forces now is because they are being armed and trained and, in effect, are being put in a position to be able to defend their own interests within that region. They made a political decision before there was any military decision. The political decision they made was that they were tired of al-Qaida literally killing their children and abusing their villages. They made the political decision that they would be better  off creating this power base of their own within the region, being trained, getting weapons, creating a Sunni capacity to respond and defend themselves. So the violence has, indeed, gone down, and al-Qaida has been diminished in its efforts in that region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to look at what happened. It was a political decision that preceded the presence of surge troops, escalated--whatever you want to call it--and that political decision has resulted in a transition. But there is nothing on the table that indicates the willingness or capacity of the central Government in Baghdad to make a similar kind of political decision for the Sunni with respect to the differences between Sunni and Shia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, you cannot make the difference with respect to the Kurds, who are essentially sitting up there in the north, independent of the rest of what is happening between Sunni and Shia, dealing with their own issue with Turkey and their own issue with some of the dislocation that took place in Kirkuk and elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the Biden amendment does is honor, respect, and build on this reality which has developed on the ground. It takes the reality of an election, which was built on fundamental mistakes by our Government, by the Provisional Authority in the beginning that has created a fundamentally sectarian electoral base from which the decisionmaking is now being made which does not adequately and fully represent the interests that have to be reconciled in the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the way you get from here to there, which is the big question--how do you get from here to there--is through the diplomatic focus that is in this amendment. It calls on the international community to come together in the standing conference that many of us have talked about for several years, and it calls on that conference to recognize these realities and begin to build the local capacity. The Iraqis will decide in what structure, how many regions, or what those regions are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a complete respect for the sovereignty of Iraqis to make these decisions. What it does is encourage  the effort of Americans to push in that direction and to create the awareness that may well be the best, most effective, most realistic, fastest way of pulling parties together to represent the interests that are not currently adequately represented within the governing process of Iraq, which is why they cannot reach a resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not that Iraqi politicians are not, frankly, tough enough to make that decision; it is that their constituencies do not want them to make that decision. That is the fundamental problem. The Shias are fundamentally committed to a Shia Islamic state, and they are not going to give up that notion when they do not have to, and they do not have to because they have been told that 130,000 American troops are going to be there well into next summer, and we will be right where we were last year  when the country almost fell apart after all of this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you have that kind of guarantee on the table, what leverage is there to make you change in a negotiation? What leverage is there if your real goal is to have a Shia Islamic state if 60 percent of the population has now been given at this unfair ballot box a power  they could never achieve in 1,300 years of history in their relationship with Sunni and Shia? If they have suddenly been given that, what is going to make that 60 percent just give it up?  They are not about to. And the 20 percent Sunni, many of whom are in the state of this insurgency, are sitting there saying: We understand that; therefore, we are not going to be adequately represented, and because we are not going to be adequately represented, we are going to continue to fight. There is no ingredient that changes that equation unless you get this kind of diplomacy and this kind of recognition of some of these realities on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One wise observer of the region said to me the other day--a former Ambassador who has written much about Iraq and thought about it a lot--they may just have to live apart before they can live together now in some of these places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not our goal for the long run. This doesn't destroy the idea of a national identity of Iraq. It doesn't undo that. It honors their own Constitution, which respects the notion of federalism. It allows for those entities to be defined by the Iraqis as to how they share the interests within those particular regions on which they decide. It also, obviously, calls on an oil law to ultimately be the linchpin of these kinds of political opinions because if they don't divide the revenues, there  is no way, ultimately, you will be able to resolve these huge sectarian differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this amendment offers us a way forward. I have said since day one, back in 2004 when I was running nationally, I said then that this could be one of the solutions, the idea of division and federalism if the Iraqis decide on it. The only way to get to that point is to have the adequacy of diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For months, we have talked--the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, Senator Lugar, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Hagel, and others--we have all talked about the need to get this adequate diplomacy going, and that is a central component of this sense-of-the-Congress amendment which Senator Biden is offering. We all know we cannot impose a solution on the Iraqis, and this amendment does not do that. We all know we cannot just walk  in and divide up the country. This amendment does not do that. This respects the sovereignty of the Iraqis, and it respects the notion that Iraq is right now a failing state with a barely functioning central government that has not to date proven its capacity to be able to reconcile</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this approach has the best opportunity to try to provide some of that stability, to help, to work, to buy time, to bring in the international community, to get the Perm Five and the neighbors and others working toward the longer term solution which this resolution also recognizes is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to change the mission, yes, and I have voted to do that and worked hard with the Senator from Michigan and others to do it. I still believe we need a firm deadline because without it, I don't believe we have leverage. And in the absence of leverage, we certainly are not going to get these kinds of reconciliations and compromises that are necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Biden's amendment recognizes that these are not mutually exclusive at all. We can push for those other things and still push for this sense-of-the-Congress amendment because accepting federalism, in fact, makes it easier to change the mission and makes it easier to allow the vast majority of our troops to leave a reasonably stable Iraq when they do finally leave.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons, Mr. President, I support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I congratulate the Senator from Delaware for his efforts on this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to make it clear that I am inclined to support this amendment also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Momentarily, the distinguished Senator from Delaware is going to move to amend the pending amendment at the desk, to reflect some corrections and alleviate some concerns I and other colleagues have. But I wish to make it eminently clear this is not a mission amendment. This is along the lines of the need for greater diplomatic involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, I can look back a year or so when my colleague was standing at that very desk and we had an amendment at that time on the previous authorization bill that he felt very strongly about. As a matter of fact, we gave it consideration at that time. It did not eventually become the law. Or in some respects it did.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend from Virginia we actually passed my amendment that did require the international effort we are talking about. Regrettably, we are a year later, and that international leverage has still not come to fruition, so I am delighted now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. President, I wanted to reflect that the Senator from Massachusetts was on this very point some time back, and now I think the realization is that, momentarily, we will have the opportunity to vote on this. I would not predict the outcome, but I thank him very much for his contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wonder if I could invite our colleague from Delaware, given there is some likelihood that we can get the UC to have a vote, if he might want to amend his amendment at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I do that, I would like to ask the Senator from Massachusetts----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have now been informed there is some objection to any amendments at this point in time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield, I don't believe there is an objection to the amendment. I think it is not in order at this moment to offer the modification.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>In any event, at this point we will not seek to do the amendments, for whatever technical reason there may be, but I would like to do it when we can get to it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Delaware.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will not bring up the amendment or amend it now, but because time is of the essence for a lot of our colleagues, I wish to speak to what the changes are that were recommended by Senator Warner and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But before the Senator from Massachusetts leaves the floor, I wish to say to him--and I hope it will not in any way cause him any difficulty--he and I have been close friends for over 30 years, and I want him to know, and I want my colleagues to know, that much of what this amendment we are hopefully going to vote on is about is what the Senator and I have talked about for the last 4 years and that he has led on, including the international piece.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a matter of fact, he led on it from a different perspective, as a candidate, as well. So I wish to tell him how grateful I am for his joining in this amendment. Quite frankly, it is a big deal that he is, and it adds not only credibility to the amendment in terms of our colleagues, but it adds, quite frankly, an international credibility to it because an awful lot of people around the world look to my colleague for his insights into what we do about the most critical issue facing American  foreign policy today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, in order for us to regain the kind of leadership in the world that I would argue we are lacking, we have to settle Iraq, and we cannot do it on our own. There is a need for the international community. Even if this answer is the perfect answer, it cannot be made in America any longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish to thank my colleague and acknowledge that I have learned from him, and I wish to thank him for--and I know we use the phrase very blithely around here--his leadership. But I mean that. I wish to thank him for his leadership. He has been absolutely totally consistent on this point from before the time we actually used force in Iraq until today. So I want the record to reflect that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, while we are waiting to determine whether we are going to be able to proceed on the amendment, I think the concerns raised by several of my friends have been incorporated in  the changes that have been made. I am not moving to amend it now, but I am going to tell my colleagues what the Biden-Brownback amendment will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the findings clauses, finding No. (3) has been added, and it is to reflect the concern raised by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl--and I suspect others, but Senator Kyl is the one who raised this with us, in that he wanted to make it clear--</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senator is correct. I brought it to your attention at the request of Senator Kyl.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>We incorporated the exact language I was originally given, with the advice of my colleague from Virginia, and it says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A central focus of al-Qaida in Iraq has been to turn sectarian division in Iraq into sectarian violence through a concentrated series of attacks, the most significant being the destruction of the Golden Dome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is one change, one addition we made. A second change we made was at the request, I believe, and I would stand corrected, of both the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, which was deleting a word. It says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraq must reach a comprehensive and sustainable political settlement in order--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, that is not true. I am getting the wrong section. I will ask my staff what the second change is, and I will go to the third change. The reason I can't find the change is because we took out the word, and I am trying to recall where we took the word out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third thing we changed is the provision in the original resolution to incorporate the strongly held view of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee that we not be forcing upon Iraq anything that is inconsistent with their wishes. The paragraph originally read:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States should actively support a political settlement in Iraq based upon the final provisions of the Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of government and allow for certain federal regions consistent with the wishes of the Iraqi people and their elected leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then, I believe at the request or suggestion of the distinguished ranking member from Virginia, the actual last paragraph of the resolution, paragraph 5, says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing in this act should be construed in any way  to infringe on the sovereign rights of the Nation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, both my colleagues can explain their motivation better than I, but the central point that is attempted to be achieved is to make it clear that neither Senator Brownback nor I, nor any of the cosponsors, believe we should be imposing a political solution on the Iraqi people. It is sort of self-evident to me that you cannot impose a political solution. A political solution has to be arrived at by the competing parties. I would argue, as I think my colleagues in the Armed Services  Committee would agree now, that what we are doing is consistent with Iraq's Constitution and consistent with the ability of the Iraqis to further amend their Constitution to come to a different conclusion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield for the purpose of my commenting on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will be delighted to yield to the Senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Paragraph 5 is the language recommended by the Senator from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incidentally, Senator McCain is the ranking member. I had that job off and on for 18 years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am sorry. I am so used to the Senator being chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wished to reflect that my colleague, Senator McCain, is the distinguished ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I put in paragraph 5, because this is a very challenging amendment, and I wanted to make certain that in no way did we overstep on the question of sovereignty. The word "sovereignty" is well described in international law and in other means as an accepted term, and it is well understood, so I am delighted the Senator agreed to put that in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, when we look at the enormity of the sacrifices of our country over these many years now--most notably the tragic loss of some 3,000, almost 3,800 individuals and many more wounded, and expenditures of so much of the taxpayers' funds--the contributions of all of that has gotten us to where we are today. The keystone of those achievements is the sovereignty that has been given to the Iraqi people. That is the major contribution of the enormity of our sacrifice through these years. So in  no way did we want to backstep from all of this hard-fought ground to achieve sovereignty for the Iraqi people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am delighted the Senator accepted that. Then, if we can look at one other paragraph, Senator, and that was on page 2, paragraph (4), the Senator was going to consider deleting the word "increasing" correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>As I understand, the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, suggested that instead of " ..... Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary cause of increasing violence in Iraq," he wished the word "increasing" be struck from the language. It now reads: " ..... settlement is the primary cause of violence in Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have struck that. To the best of my knowledge, I say to my friend from Virginia, I think we have accommodated all the changes that were suggested.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first going to paragraph (4), deleting "increasing" and the concern of the distinguished ranking member, Senator Lugar, it was also a concern to the Department of State. So that has been done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the concerns that have been brought to this Senator's attention, the Senator from Virginia, I think have been met by the Senator from Delaware, and it is for that reason I am pleased, if and when we get to the vote, to cast a vote in favor of this because I think it is an important amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, if I may say, it reflects a goal that I and many others have had for a long time; namely, to have a showing of some bipartisanship. I am hopeful this will draw votes from not only your side of the aisle but this side of the aisle, and it can be viewed as a truly bipartisan amendment. Certainly, you have distinguished cosponsors on it, Senator Brownback, Senator Hutchison, Senator Specter, and others, so I believe it will be viewed as a bipartisan amendment. And  that in and of itself is an important contribution to this debate all around.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I see the chairman has risen. Does he wish to speak?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Senator will yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Michigan.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to briefly thank and commend the Senator from Delaware for his ongoing leadership in a very critical area, and that is the area of federalism in Iraq. He has made it clear in his amendment, he has made it clear in his remarks that the federalism he is referring to is the federalism which the Iraqis have placed in their Constitution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>There is no effort here to impose our view of federalism or an outside view of federalism on the Iraqis. It is their view of federalism, reflected in their own Constitution, that the Senator has viewed as a real potential solution to the violence in the provinces in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I wish to thank the Senator from Delaware, and perhaps at this point, if I could get the attention of the Senator from Delaware, in order to save time later, he and I have entered into a colloquy which doesn't need to be made part of the Record at this time, it could be put in the Record after the amendment is modified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask unanimous consent that after the amendment is modified to have printed in the Record a colloquy between myself and the Senator from Delaware.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the colloquy which we will offer then at a later time refers to two changes that have been made, or will be offered to the amendment by the Senator from Delaware, modifying his own amendment, which he has a right to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first suggestion I made, which he has readily accepted, is to make it clear the federalism that is being referred to in his language is the federalism in the Iraqi Constitution as it now reads or as it may be amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In  the event that the Iraqis' constitutional commission makes recommendations on that subject, and if those recommendations are accepted by the people, it is their view of federalism, in the current Constitution or in an amended Constitution, the word he added being "final," that he is referring to. I thank him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I thank him for accepting language which makes it clear that the federalism he is referring to is a system of government that allows for the creation of Federal regions. The words that are now added, or would be added when it is modified are "consistent with the wishes of the Iraqi people and their elected leaders."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I propose that is we have to be very clear that what the Senator from Delaware is focusing on is a Federal system which the Iraqi people either have adopted or will adopt. This is something consistent with their wishes, not ours. What we wish them to do is get on with their solutions, their political solutions. What the Senator from Delaware is so properly focusing on, and I think this Nation should be in his debt for it, is the potential of a Federal system as they designed it for  addressing their problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen the value of federalism here, but it is not our version of it that the Senator is talking about. It is the idea of federalism and how you are able to adjust powers between the central government and regions which has such potential for finally ending the violence in Iraq. He recommends it. We all, I hope, will support that as being a potential solution--not imposed on them but one which they have fashioned in their own Constitution, have adopted in their own Constitution, can amend  in their own Constitution. That, it seems to me, is a very valuable contribution for which I commend the Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He can offer, on our behalf, a colloquy at the appropriate time relative to the modification when it is offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>I wanted to clarify one thing. Through no fault of the Senator from Delaware--he was under the impression that certain language he agreed to, to change his resolution, had come from me, and he had reason to believe that. It did not come from me, but that is not his mistake. But I did want to clarify the record that the language that he had agreed to had not been language that came from me. For reasons I will not go into at this point, I still have concerns about the resolution as a result.  But it is not the fault of the Senator from Delaware that he was under the impression that it was language from me.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand. The Senator is correct; I was under a misimpression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand it, for our colleagues here--and I say to my colleague from Michigan, the chairman, I understand it would accommodate other Senators if we were to set a time certain to vote tomorrow morning on this amendment and, I guess, I don't know, the Lieberman amendment--Lieberman/Kyl. I don't know that. But if it is at all possible, I know it should not be a consideration of the Senate and obviously whatever the Senate's will I would abide by it, but it would be very helpful to me as a  practical matter--there are these pesky little Presidential debates that intervene and there is one tomorrow in New Hampshire. If it accommodates the body I would be delighted to do it this evening, but if we could consider doing it at 10 o'clock in the morning, it would be very much appreciated by the Senator from Delaware--if that is possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there will be no more votes tonight. We have tried to work something out on the Kyl-Lieberman amendment and the Biden amendment. We have been unable to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been very close a few times, but we have just been informed that Senator Biden will not have a vote anytime in the near future. There will not be a vote on the other one anytime in the near future. We hope tonight will bring more clearness on the issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Now, sometimes things just do not work out. But anytime we decide, on this side, the majority, there are not going to be votes, Senator McConnell knows. That is an arrangement I made with him. I have stuck to that for the last 8 months.</paragraph>
