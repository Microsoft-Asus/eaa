    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise on a happy note. It is a happy birthday today, the birthday of the United Nations. It was 62 years ago when 50 countries gathered in the great City of San Francisco, California, to make the cause of international peace and security a global mantra and launched the United Nations. It was a good idea then, and 62 years later, it is still a good idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a world that is tense with war, the U.N. fights for peace every day. Where hunger plagues the poor, the U.N. provides food aid to more than 80 million people every day, every year. In 166 nations that suffer devastating poverty, the U.N. offers proactive programs to buttress economic development. And, most important of all, the U.N. deploys 100,000 peacekeepers around the world on missions vital to stabilization of regions under threat of conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer to global distress is found in solving the problems that are the root causes of poverty, the lack of health care, shelter and legislation. The U.N. is the only organization worldwide dedicated to this grand mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the United Nations for its hard work, and ask Members of this body to support and invigorate America's commitment to this vital international organization.</paragraph>
