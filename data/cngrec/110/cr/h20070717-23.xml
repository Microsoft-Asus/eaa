    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to honor the life of Sergeant First Class William "Bill" Zapfe. Sergeant Zapfe was serving with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division as a combat engineer when he was tragically killed by an improvised explosive device last month. Sergeant Zapfe was a dedicated soldier on his third tour in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill grew up in Park Hills and Dry Ridge, Kentucky, and joined the military shortly after graduating from high school. He came from a family of dedicated public servants. His late father, Joseph, was a State trooper, and his two brothers, Joseph and Edward, have also both dutifully served our Nation. He is remembered by his family as a loving and devoted husband and father. Bill Zapfe is a true patriot who died fighting for a cause he believed in. Bill leaves behind his mother, Jeanne; his loving  wife, Evelyn; and his three children, Anastasia, Cameron, and Spencer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we honor the life of Sergeant Zapfe, our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We thank Sergeant Zapfe for his service and for answering the call to protect our great Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
