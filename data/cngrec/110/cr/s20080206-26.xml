    <paragraph>Mr. President, each year, the America's Promise Alliance names the 100 Best Communities for Young People in the Nation. Today, I am proud to honor five Minnesota towns that have achieved this tremendous designation--Landfall, Mankato, Northfield, Saint Louis Park, and Saint Paul, MN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 100 Best Communities for Young People is an annual competition that recognizes outstanding community-wide efforts that improve the well-being of youth and inspire other localities to take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is apparently much to find inspiration from, as two previous award winners have now become five--a strong showing from the great State of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of these five Minnesota communities demonstrated a commitment to community support of children through resources including effective education, safe gathering places, and a wide range of programming. Their commitment generates real outcomes in the form of high graduation rates and educational achievement, healthy behaviors, and civic engagement by their young population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Landfall, MN, is a small town with big plans for its young people. A town of just 700, they place a premium on expanding the horizons of young people. They provide students with "Extra Innings," a tutoring and mentoring program that gives elementary through high school students one-on-one help with math, reading, and English as a second language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mankato, MN, a three-time winner of this honor, prides itself on embracing young people to help them reach their fullest potential. Among their initiatives is the LinkCrew, which pairs high school freshmen with junior and senior year mentors to help them make a successful transition to high school. And, as the town that raised six Bessler boys, including my husband John, I know firsthand of the high-caliber young people Mankato produces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Northfield, MN, used to be a farm town, centered between corn and wheat fields. Now, anchored by two of our Nation's preeminent colleges, Carleton College and Saint Olaf College, Northfield has become an enriching place for young people. The Mayor's Youth Council allows students ages 15 to 18 to advise the mayor and city council on issues related to the young population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Saint Louis Park, MN, is also a three-time winner. They welcome youth into their process of government, inviting them to participate in decisionmaking on special neighborhood and community issues. Among other attractions, it is home to 51 parks thanks to the city's initiative to reserve a percentage of all city land for public parks. And in a special nod to its young population, the city's Web site lists the best sledding hills in its community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Saint Paul, MN, is our State's capital city and a shining example of how to engage children after school hours. Through the Second Shift and After School Initiatives, they provide positive places for children to spend their afternoons, develop new skills, and obtain academic assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his theatre in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota's native son, Garrison Keillor, refers to his fictional Minnesota town of Lake Wobegon as a place where "all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average." These five towns have certainly proven Keillor's words are more truth than fiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to represent five of America's Best Communities for Young People and to congratulate them before the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
