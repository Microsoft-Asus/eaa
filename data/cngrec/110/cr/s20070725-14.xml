  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to talk about a bill that I am proud of, and of which all Americans should be proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first want to commend the esteemed chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator BYRD for his commitment to drafting a bill that is in our Nation's best interest. I also would like to convey my respect for Senator BYRD and the ranking member, Senator COCHRAN, for the exemplary bipartisan they have shown in negotiating this bill and bringing it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Homeland Security Appropriations bill that will be before us later  today is a clear indication that our priorities have changed. After years of neglecting key homeland security initiatives, this bill ends a trend that has been straining our first responders, forcing our States to come up with more, and leaving us more vulnerable than we should be 6 years after September 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is part of a framework that we have created this year to restructure our priorities--and it is clear that homeland security is at the top of the list. I am proud of the levels we set in the budget resolution we passed earlier this year. As a member of the Budget Committee, one of my top requests to Chairman CONRAD was that we provide enough to the Appropriations Committee so that it could not just reject the President's cuts to key homeland security funding, but go above and  beyond what has been funded in recent years. I thank Chairman CONRAD, for his commitment to homeland security funding in the budget resolution and for understanding what those funds mean to a State like New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year we have set the tone. The message is clear--when it comes to homeland security, the status quo just won't cut it. This bill says that loud and clear. By increasing overall funding by 8 percent over last year, we recognize that those on our front lines need our support. In this bill, they will get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For New Jersey, the funds in this bill mean the difference between having what we need to protect our high-risk areas and leaving our infrastructure vulnerable. The grants this bill provides means millions more for our ports to increase site security and implement key initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increases for next year mean our fire departments will have the resources they need to hire new firefighters, to upgrade their equipment, and to reduce the long shifts far too many of them are working. The focus on first responder funding means our law enforcement will continue to have support to carry out key terrorism prevention efforts in our cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most importantly, this bill does not take the approach that we can do what is minimally required and pretend that is enough. For all of the President's talks about how critical security at home is, for all the administration continues to warn us about how at risk we are for an attack, I am just dumbfounded because no matter where I look, I cannot find where he makes supporting our first responders a priority. No matter how hard I try, I cannot see how he expects our ports to be as secure  as they should be 6 years after September 11. For all the reminders this administration likes to give the American people that we are at war, that we are vulnerable, that we must be vigilant, I do not see where we are matching that rhetoric with dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is about more than rhetoric. It is about providing what is needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that this bill rejects the President's cuts to first responders, and actually increases funding by $644 million. Nearly 6 years after September 11, would seem unfathomable that we would actually cut funding for first responders, but that is exactly what the President's budget called for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we provide more than $400 million than the President for firefighters. We increase funding for FIRE grants by $25 million more than last year so that fire departments can purchase new equipment. When nearly a third of firefighters are not equipped with a self-contained breathing apparatus or portable radios, I think there is no question that these funds are sorely needed. One of the grant programs I hear about the most, as I am sure do many members, is the SAFER grants. I have listened  to firefighters from my State far too many times plead for the SAFER grants not to be cut. And yet, every year, this is a fight we have had to have with the administration. I truly hope this is the last year. These grants help departments increase their staff, often so they can cover more 24-hour shifts. Our bill increases funding by $13 million over last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also extremely proud of the direction this bill takes us for improving key grant funding to States and our most at-risk areas. This bill restores the two major grant programs, the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, and increases funding for urban area security grants. For reasons I cannot explain, the President sought to cut State homeland grants in half, and practically eliminate the law enforcement grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For States like New Jersey, these funds are not just an added bonus--they are essential. These grants allow States to purchase equipment, train first responders, put in place response plans, and a whole host of other critical activities. By restoring cuts to these programs, officials in New Jersey will have the confidence that we are working to provide them every last dollar, and that we understand how critical this funding is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill also provides an increase for the Urban Area Security Initiative, the only fully-risked based funding of its kind, designed to help the most high-threat urban areas. I have spoken on this floor before about the unique threats that our UASI--Urban Area Security Initiative--region in northern New Jersey faces. As one of the most densely populated areas in the Nation, we face the complexity of populous neighborhoods nestled among high-profile infrastructure, including the largest port on  the east coast, a major international airport, and a string of chemical plants--which makes up what is known as the "2 most dangerous miles" in America. When people back home hear that, they ask me what we are doing to protect that area, because those 2</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill also seeks to end the trend of pouring our resources into aviation security and spending pennies in comparison on rail, mass transit, port, and chemical security. This bill more than doubles funding for rail and transit security, and far exceeds what our past funding bills have done for port security. We provide $400 million for port security grants, a level which our ports have been calling for for some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone who knows the Port of New York and New Jersey understands the daunting task of securing the perimeter of the port. The port is surrounded by storage facilities and warehouses, with waterways on one side, and a major highway and an airport on the other, and rail lines and a major pipeline running along side it. So, for a site as complex as our port, perimeter security is no easy feat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's ports have a long to-do list, and I guarantee you, every one of the improvements they want to make costs money. In the wake of the SAFE Port Act, which the President signed into law last year, our ports have even more requirements they are supposed to carry out. Yet the President did not call for any funding to implement these initiatives. Our bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We double port security grants, to the level authorized in the SAFE Port Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We provide $15 million for the Coast Guard so they can increase the number of inspections at facilities, conduct vulnerability assessments, and develop long-range vessel tracking systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We provide $60 million for operational centers as called for in the SAFE Port Act that will help coordinate information sharing, intelligence gathering, and support cooperation among Federal, State, and local agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, we provide $15 million to help ports implement the TWIC port worker ID program, which has been delayed again and again. It is past time for us to have something as simple as uniform, technologically advanced ID cads for those workers at our ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also contains a very short, but very crucial provision that is well known to people in New Jersey. It allows States to have more stringent chemical security standards. If you have ever been to Newark's Liberty Airport, than you were within a few short miles of the Kuehne plant in South Kearny, in a range that would without question be devastated by an attack at that facility. Because plants like this one are uniquely sandwiched between highways and neighborhoods, in an area that rises  to the level of being called the "2 most dangerous miles," New Jersey has taken action to make sure we are doing everything possible to keep these plants secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because it is far ahead of the curve when it comes to chemical security, the notion that the Department of Homeland Security can issue regulations that could preempt New Jersey's, and possibly be weaker than our standards, turns logic on its head. The bottom line is, when it comes to the security of things uniquely New Jersey, like the location of this chemical plant, no one knows what we need better than our State. And that is the position that this bill takes. I applaud my fellow Senator from  New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, for ensuring this language is part of this bill, and I thank Senator BYRD for realizing how essential preserving New Jersey's standards are for the future of chemical security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this Homeland Security appropriations bill is passed and signed into law, we will be able to definitively say we have passed legislation that makes us smarter and stronger when it comes to our Nation's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill ensures we are protecting, not neglecting, our critical infrastructure; our first responders have more, not less, to do their jobs; and our States will have the critical resources they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support this incredibly sound bill and take this important step to getting our homeland security funding where it should be in finally meeting the challenge of securing our Nation.</paragraph>
