    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month three college students were murdered by a horrifically violent criminal alien with three previous felony arrests, including the rape of a 5-year-old girl. He should have been deported, but Newark, New Jersey's "sanctuary" law prevented local law enforcement from working with the Feds to detain and deport him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need an efficient system of identifying and removing violent criminal elements. That is why I am introducing the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007. This bill increases Federal funds to local law enforcement agencies, provides the information they need, requires the Feds to remove and deport criminal aliens and reduces Federal funds for cities that provide safe haven to violent criminal aliens that harm the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007.</paragraph>
