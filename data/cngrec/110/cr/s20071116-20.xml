  <narrative>THE FARM BILL -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14602">S14602</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me conclude on the farm bill itself. This farm bill is fiscally responsible. It is a 5-year reauthorization. It is fully paid for. It complies with pay-go. It cuts commodity title payments by $7.5 billion over 5 years. That is a fact. In fact, the share of the total Federal budget going to commodity programs is reduced from the previous farm bill, from three-quarters of 1 percent of total Federal spending to one-quarter of 1 percent. That is a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill tightens payment limitations and eliminates loopholes. It adopts the elimination of the three-entity rule that allowed people to hide behind paper entities to get farm program payments. It eliminates that abuse. It requires direct attribution of farm program payments so a living, breathing human being has to be the recipient of these payments--again, instead of being able to hide behind a mask of phony corporate entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is fiscally responsible. When my colleague says this bill has tax increases in it--$15 billion he asserted of tax increases--wrong again. Is there more revenue in this bill? Yes. How can it be there is more revenue but not tax increases? Well, let's look.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at where the revenue comes from--$15 billion over 5 years. Where does it come from? It comes from codifying the "economic substance" doctrine that prohibits businesses from using certain tax-avoidance schemes. Is that a tax increase? No, I do not think that is a tax increase. I think that is shutting down a bunch of tax scams that are going on around the country. In fact, you heard the Republican ranking member of the Finance Committee out here on the floor vigorously defending that  pay-for, and that came out of the Finance Committee on a vote of 17 to 4--overwhelming bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second pay-for is to revoke tax benefits for leasing foreign subways and sewer systems. Now they are going to say that is a tax increase? Let's understand what is happening. We have certain corporations and wealthy individuals who are buying--get this--buying foreign sewer systems, and depreciating them on the books for U.S. tax purposes--leasing those sewer systems back to the European cities that bought them in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did they do this because they are in the sewer business? No. They are not in the sewer business. They are in monkey business. They are buying foreign sewer systems to depreciate them on the books in the United States to reduce their taxes in the United States. They have nothing to do with being in the sewer business in European cities. They want to call that a tax increase? Again, that provision came out of the Senate Finance Committee on a vote of 17 to 4--a very strong bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where is the other revenue coming from?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing penalties for failure to file correct information returns. That is not a tax increase. That is a penalty for people who are trying to cheat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, denying deductions for certain fines and penalties. That is, again,  an additional inducement for people to play fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, much of the money--in fact, two-thirds of the money--that has come from this additional revenue has been turned around and put right back out in tax cuts. You did not hear that from the other side, did you? They never mention that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, what are the tax cuts that are in this bill? There is $7.3 billion for conservation, including a tax credit for farmland in the Conservation Reserve Program--a program that affects over 10 million acres across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is $2.5 billion for energy, including a tax credit for small producers of cellulosic fuel and $800 million for agriculture and rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the tax reduction elements which are a part of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final point I want to make is this Democratic-led Congress has rejected the failed fiscal policies of the last 2 years. We have put in place a strong pay-go rule. It is working by any standard--by any objective standard. While it would not single-handedly solve all of our problems, it is making a meaningful contribution. The fact is, the pay-go scorecard, as of this moment, shows a positive balance. That means the legislation that has been advanced has been paid for. That is a significant  departure from what has gone on in the previous 6 years under the control of our colleagues on the other side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is going to be a long, tough slog for us to get done what needs to be done and get America back on track, at least in the fiscal arena. While the Senator from New Hampshire and I have sharp disagreement on these matters, we are working together on a plan to bring together a bipartisan task force--16 Members; 8 Democrats, 8 Republicans--with the responsibility to come up with a plan, a long-term plan to get America back on track. In that, he and I are joined at the hip, and we are prepared  to ask our colleagues to come together in a bipartisan way to develop a plan to deal with these long-term imbalances. So while we have sharp disagreement on the question of pay-go and on the question of their fiscal record versus ours, one place we are in complete agreement is on the need to face up to these long-term fiscal imbalances. That is in the interests of our country. That is in the interests of every citizen of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, just very briefly if I could, I say to my colleague, I am just going to take 30 seconds.</paragraph>
