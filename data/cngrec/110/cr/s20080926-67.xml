  <narrative>RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9636">S9636</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which includes a provision that extends a credit under section 45 of the Tax Code to "steel industry fuel." Steel industry fuel is a feedstock for the production of coke that is important to our Nation because it provides significant energy, environmental, economic, and financial benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy and environmental benefits include utilizing a high Btu content hazardous waste in a fuel product that is created using a process that has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. The use of steel industry fuel makes our domestic steel industry economically more competitive by lowering production and operational costs. This in turn provides national defense benefits from a stronger domestic manufacturing base. It also provides financial benefits to steel company employees  and retirees who all gain from a more competitive steel industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The addition of steel industry fuel to the section 45 credit is intended to promote the use of the steel industry fuel process to manufacture a feedstock for the production of coke that recaptures the Btu content of "coal waste sludge." Coal waste sludge is the tar decanter sludge and other byproducts of the coking process. These materials have generally been treated as hazardous wastes under applicable Federal environmental rules (and in the past have been stored in the ground and in lagoons).  Coal waste sludge has an energy content ranging from 7,000 Btus to 16,000 Btus per pound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal waste sludge can generally be disposed of by one of several methods--use as part of a fuel product, steel industry fuel, incineration, or foreign land-filling. The most favorable method, from an energy resource and environmental perspective, is to use a process that liquefies the coal waste sludge and combines the liquefied coal waste sludge with coal to create steel industry fuel for use as a fuel product in steel producers' coke batteries. This method recaptures the significant energy  content of the coal waste sludge and can be performed onsite at the steel producers' coke operations. The disposal of coal waste sludge in this manner has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. See 50 Federal Register No. 120, June 22, 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The alternative methods of disposal are to transport the coal waste sludge offsite for incineration or to foreign countries for landfilling. Offsite disposal has significant drawbacks, including the need to physically convey a hazardous waste, which is a dangerous, cumbersome, and expensive undertaking, and the failure to recapture the energy content of the coal waste sludge if it is incinerated or landfilled in a foreign country. Incineration of coal waste sludge also requires the utilization  of energy resources to burn up another energy resource, the coal waste sludge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steel industry fuel is produced using a facility that liquefies and distributes on each ton of coal approximately one-quarter to one-half gallon of coal waste sludge. Liquefied coal waste sludge in these amounts avoids operational and equipment problems with the coke batteries that use steel industry fuel as a feedstock to produce coke. An excessive amount of coal waste sludge in the coke battery causes adverse and irreparable damage to the coke battery. Steel industry fuel facilities include  a facility that is comprised of one or more batch tanks and/or one or more storage tanks, steam and spray pipes, processing pumps, variable speed drives, a flowmeter, and related electrical equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Explanation of Credit: The refined coal credit for steel industry fuel in the act is intended to provide an incentive for the expanded production of steel industry fuel. This expanded production is intended to provide energy and environmental benefits by promoting the use of an alternative fuel that recaptures the energy content of a byproduct of the coking process, coal waste sludge, which would otherwise be treated as a hazardous waste. Accordingly, a credit is provided for the barrel-of-oil-equivalent  production of steel industry fuel. The steel industry fuel provision the Senate approved would modify the current credit under section 45 with regard to the amount of the credit and the time period for the availability of the credit. This is necessary to differentiate the refined coal product that becomes steel industry fuel from</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To reflect differences between the refined coal currently eligible for a credit and refined coal credit that is steel industry fuel, such as higher coal costs for the metallurgical coal used to manufacture steel industry fuel, the steel industry fuel provision modifies Section 45 with regard to the amount of the credit, the placed in service period, the credit period, and other items.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The steel industry fuel provision in the act is drafted to provide greater certainty to steel industry fuel producers that their fuel production is eligible for the credit by providing specific definitions for both "steel industry fuel" and "coal waste sludge." This greater specificity is designed to attract the outside investment that is needed to finance steel industry fuel projects and expand the use of the steel industry fuel process.</paragraph>
