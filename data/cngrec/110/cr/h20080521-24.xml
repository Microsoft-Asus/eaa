  <narrative>WAR FUNDING BILLS SHOULD BE ABOUT WAR FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4328]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think war funding bills ought to be about war funding. Last week, the Democrat Congress tried and failed to pass an Iraq funding bill by piling billions of dollars in unrelated domestic spending and higher taxes on the backs of our soldiers. But because House Republicans took a stand, the American people could plainly see that the majority of the majority is willing to cut off funding to our soldiers, even when they are in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Memorial Day just around the corner, this Congress should stop playing politics with funding for our troops. We should pass a clean Iraq funding bill, legislation authored by Representative JERRY LEWIS of California, and we should pass it this week. As we prepare to remember the heroes of conflicts past, let's make sure that today's heroes have the resources they need to get the job done and come home safe.</paragraph>
