    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me on behalf of the Louisiana delegation to introduce to the Members of the House our newest Member, STEVE SCALISE. STEVE is a graduate of the home of the current national college football champions, the LSU Tigers. And he has a degree in computer science. And he told me to tell you all that if you are having problems with your computer, feel free to call him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STEVE comes to us after 12 years' experience in the Louisiana legislature where he had a distinguished career. He was known as a reformer in a place where there was not much reform on the minds of many people in State government. So STEVE comes to us with a distinguished record of service for the people of Louisiana already. And I am sure he will bring that same distinction to his service here in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STEVE has a lovely family, which I will give him the honor of introducing. Please help me welcome to our ranks STEVE SCALISE.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SCALISE" of="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congressman McCrery. Thank you, Madam Speaker, Leader BOEHNER, the rest of the members of the Louisiana delegation and all of my new colleagues here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is truly an honor to serve in this distinguished body. I must thank so many people. But I have got to first thank God for helping to give me the strength to get here. I want to thank my family and my wife, Jennifer, who is in the balcony with our beautiful daughter, Madison. It is also Jennifer's birthday today, so it is an even extra special day. I promise I will not sing here on the floor, maybe later. We do have a 13-month-old beautiful daughter, Madison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father is here with his wife, Maggie. I want to thank him and Maggie for coming. My sister, Tara, is here as well. And my brother, Glenn, could not be with us. I know my mom, Carol, is looking from above and smiling. And so many other friends and family, we have got a wonderful group of friends that are here with us today as well. And it is truly an honor. I want to thank the voters of the First Congressional District for giving me this honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have many challenges, while we are still recovering, I want to thank each of you for all the help you have given us in the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. There is still work to do, but the help you have given has really helped people start to get their lives back in order. I know our country faces many great challenges too, but our Founding Fathers created the greatest democracy in the history of the world when they created this system that we have, this House and Senate.  In this building we have got the ability, the talent and the people to solve those problems. I look very forward to working with each and every one of you to help tackle those challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks again to the voters of the district and my family. God bless Louisiana, and God bless the United States of America.</paragraph>
