    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know we have so many important things to do dealing with this legislation, but I do wish to say something about what is going on in Nevada. We have a serious problem in Nevada, and it is fires. This is about the fourth year we have had these raging wildfires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is so difficult. The smoke is so thick, helicopters cannot fly. Firefighters have been lost not knowing where they are fighting these fires. It is rough terrain. What people do not understand is, Nevada--other than Alaska--is the most mountainous State in the Union. It has 314 separate mountain ranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. Some of this terrain, where these fires are burning, is very difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We share Lake Tahoe with California. There was a raging fire there that lasted 2 weeks. It has now been put out. But they think that at least 400 structures have burned, with 275 or 300 homes burned to the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a lot of the land in Nevada not many people live there. In spite of that, people do live there. It is rural, and fires have been raging. What has happened with the fires that have taken place in the past, we have these species that are foreign to the high deserts of Nevada. They start burning, they get into the low mountains, they get into the cedars and the pines and then start burning in the forests. That is what has happened in Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one fire we have had three lives lost. This fire burned so quickly that three grown men could not escape the fire. They were doing work on their farm. There was an 11-year-old boy. They saw the fire coming. They said, "Run for your life," literally, and the 11-year-old boy ran and did survive. His family did not. They all died--three of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say this because we have shut down roads. In one part of Utah, 100 miles of interstate were closed because of fires. Think about that: 100 miles of interstate closed. People could not go. One reason was the smoke was so thick--not the fire, the smoke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been remarkable heroism, as there always is with these men and women who fight these raging fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quoted, a couple weeks ago, Edward Croker, a long past fire chief in the State of New York, who said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no ambition in this world but one, and that is to be a fireman. Our proudest moment is to save lives. Under the impulse of such thoughts, the nobility of the occupation thrills us and stimulates us to deeds of daring, even of supreme sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way fires are fought 100 years after this man said this is different than the way they used to be fought, but it still takes a great deal of courage and many times heroism to go forward in these areas where burning is taking place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So far, 245 square miles in northern Nevada have burned. That is a lot of ground: 245 square miles. Some of the fires are not under control yet. So I want the Record to reflect we have problems in the West. Some say it is because of global warming. Whatever the reason, we have never had fires such as we have had in the last 4 years in Nevada and I think in the West, generally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would finally say, long after the smoke has cleared, the accounts of bravery will still be told in Nevada.</paragraph>
