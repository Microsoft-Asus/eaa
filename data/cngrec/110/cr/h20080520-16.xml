    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the last couple of weeks, this House has passed important legislation that is going to provide some much needed relief to hardworking families who are being squeezed by high gas prices, high grocery bills, and a housing crisis that many economists believe has not yet hit rock bottom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, Congress took decisive action to bring down the price of gas by passing legislation to suspend the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the end of the year. After initially opposing the proposal, the President announced last Friday that he would comply. The House also overwhelmingly supported a farm bill conference report that invests $10 billion more in nutrition programs that will help 38 million Americans afford healthy food. And earlier this month, we passed housing  legislation that stabilizes the housing market and makes a real difference for families at risk of losing their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this month, the House has passed significant legislation that will help all Americans and will basically address the economic downturn. I would hope the President would also support these important initiatives.</paragraph>
