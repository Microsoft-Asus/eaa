  <speaking speaker="400386" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my sad responsibility as the dean of the South Carolina delegation to advise the House of the death of a former Member, Representative Mendel Davis, who passed away after several years of respiratory problems this weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now like to yield to the gentleman from Charleston, South Carolina, Mr. Henry Brown, who holds his seat, to say a word of respect and remembrance.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400049" topic="">
    <paragraph>I certainly appreciate the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mendel Davis was a close friend of mine. He was born in and was a resident of North Charleston, South Carolina, which is part of my congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mendel Davis entered Congress after a special election in 1971 to replace his godfather, former Representative Mendel Rivers. Mendel Davis was reelected to Congress an additional four more times. He was a graduate of the College of Charleston and received his law degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mendel Davis was one of the major reasons that the USS Yorktown now calls Patriot's Point in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina its home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a champion for the little guy, and he was always known for his timely and efficient service to his constituents who loved and respected him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know we will all miss Mendel Davis very much. During his time serving the people in the House of Representatives, he made it a better place to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe 1 minute of silence in honor of our former colleague, Representative Mendel Davis.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
