  <narrative>NEW BUSH ADMINISTRATION RESTRICTIONS TO THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10516]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month the Bush administration dealt yet another blow to uninsured Americans, this time focused on millions of uninsured children in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New guidelines set forth by the administration require that children must go without health insurance for at least 1 year before States will be allowed to provide them with coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program. The administration also requires States to enroll at least 95 percent of the children below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level before they can provide health coverage to other low-income children, a standard that no State in the country can currently meet. The Bush  administration is limiting the very flexibility that has made the CHIP program successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable for the President to require low-income children to spend a year of their lives without health insurance, especially when we have a program in place that can provide them with the coverage they need today. It is time for the President to stop playing political games with the children's health care and to vow to work with us to strengthen, not weaken, the CHIP program.</paragraph>
