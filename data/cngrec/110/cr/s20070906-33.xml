    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize several cities in New Mexico that have recently received national accreditation for completing the Main Street Four-Point Approach. The National Trust Main Street Center recently named nine cities' Main Street projects as being nationally accredited. Those nine communities include Artesia, Clayton, Clovis, Hobbs, Las Cruces, Las Vegas, Los Alamos, Raton, and Silver City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The work that has been done in these communities to preserve the history of downtown, as well as bring it into the 21st century, is to be honored. Main streets are a big part of every community's history. They provide a look into the past, and with these revitalizations, a positive look into the future. Downtown used to be the hub of a city. With the invention of the automobile, cities have spread out and often no longer have just one central area of activity. With these new improvements to local  main streets, towns are beginning to experience businesses returning to these areas. These towns have been able to marry the past with the present. They are honoring old businesses that have been in downtown areas for years, while encouraging new businesses to open their doors in this district. The success of their efforts is evident by this award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate these cities on the good work they are doing to bring the main street appeal back into their communities.</paragraph>
