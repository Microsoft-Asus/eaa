  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, well, here we are again. Another day, another several billion dollars in new spending proposed by this "Hold Onto Your Wallet" Congress. They have already passed the largest tax increase in history, and they spend too much money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's tax du jour comes in the form of the Foreign Ops bill. The bloated 2008 spending bill will fork over $34 billion of your tax money, an increase of more than $3 billion. A subtle change means that under the current bill language, the Mexico City policy, which assures that nongovernmental entities that promote abortion would not be provided U.S. funding, could be completely disregarded and these entities would receive U.S. taxpayer funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision would mandate U.S. subsidies to organizations that actively promote abortion in foreign nations. Abortion has been a tragedy for many women here in the U.S., and it will carry with it the same hurt and trauma when it's used abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this language stays in the bill, the American taxpayer would be actually paying for an abortion for someone half  a world away. I urge my colleagues to vote against new spending and "no" for taxpayer-sponsored abortions.</paragraph>
