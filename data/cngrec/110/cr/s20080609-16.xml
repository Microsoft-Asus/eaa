    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the community of Canova, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. Canova is a rural community located in Miner County, and will be celebrating its quasquicentennial the weekend of July 4-6.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The combination of the Homestead Act of 1862, the opening of Government lands, and the influx of railroads through the State all added greatly to the development of Canova in the 19th century. L.W. Aldrich and H.W. Eddy, both from Watertown, NY, bought the land around Canova, while F.D. Woodbury registered Canova as a town in 1883.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The town of Canova was built on the pillars of farming, faith, and baseball, boasting 8 State titles and 11 runner-up finishes. These activities serve to bring this close-knit community even closer together. While the school has since closed, it did bring about the birth of the Canova Alumni and the promotion of community health with the CARE Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most South Dakotans call small towns like Canova home. South Dakota's small communities are the bedrock of our economy and vital to the future of our State. It is especially because of our small communities, and the feelings of loyalty and familiarity that they engender, that I am proud to call South Dakota home. Towns like Canova and its citizens are no different and truly know what it means to be South Dakotan. Even 125 years after its founding, Canova continues to be a vibrant addition to  our wonderful State, and I once again congratulate them on this achievement.</paragraph>
