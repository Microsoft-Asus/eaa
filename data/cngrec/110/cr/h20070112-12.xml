  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. We could even call it the Big Government Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. You know, I represent about 70,000 Medicare part D beneficiaries in my district and they deserve low-cost prescription drugs and the option to choose the plans that best suit their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part D plans have produced greater than expected savings and our Medicare beneficiaries appreciate this. They are saving an average of $1,200 annually on their drug costs. Program costs are going to be about $200 billion lower than expected over the next 10 years. And repealing part D noninterference will create drug therapy restrictions found in the Department of Veterans Affairs programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of talk about the Veterans Affairs and comparing that to Medicare. That is like comparing apples and oranges, because the VA is a direct provider of medical services, where Medicare part D is an insurance program for our seniors that allows them to choose to access and to control their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote "no."</paragraph>
