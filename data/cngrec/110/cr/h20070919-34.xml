    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after terrorists attacked New York City and Washington, DC on September 11, 2001, our Nation came together. Without a study commission or partisanship, Congress quickly passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to help business owners, and acted swiftly again by passing an extension in 2005. Now again, less than 2 years later, we just considered another TRIA extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress can come together and help businesses after a terrorist attack, we should be able to come together to help homeowners who cannot afford the skyrocketing costs of insurance. For over 3 years, Congress has forgotten about homeowners around the country who are grappling with ever-increasing insurance rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, Mr. Buchanan and I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would have added homeowners' reinsurance as losses covered under TRIA. This measure would have helped new families, parents, and grandparents who are homeowners. Sadly, the Rules Committee did not allow this amendment to be part of the rule and so Members did not have the opportunity to help their constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I voted for TRIA, we should be saddened that the majority chose only to help business owners today and to ignore the insurance crisis facing homeowners.</paragraph>
