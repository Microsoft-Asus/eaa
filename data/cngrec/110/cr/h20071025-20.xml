    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, due to official business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I unavoidably missed two votes. If I had been present, I would have voted "nay" on rollcall No. 1008, the motion to  recommit <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, and "yea" on rollcall No. 1009, final passage of <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
