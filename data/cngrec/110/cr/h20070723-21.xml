    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation, which I introduced on March 13 of this year, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Avra/Black Wash Reclamation and Riparian Restoration Project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The extremely arid climate of Tucson, Arizona, and that metropolitan area requires careful and innovative planning of both water supply and wastewater treatment systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposed Avra Valley Reclamation and Riparian Restoration Site would spread treated wastewater on mesquite riparian forest in Black Wash, creating valuable riparian habitats for migrating birds, while recharging groundwater for the greater Tucson area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairwoman of the subcommittee on Water and Power, Mrs. Napolitano, and the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, Mr. Rahall, for their assistance in advancing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="1503">H.R. 1503</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="RODGERS, McMORRIS" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman and sponsor of this legislation has adequately explained the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As amended, the funding in this bill is now specifically targeted for wastewater infrastructure rather than trails and a visitors center. Despite this positive change, however, I note this bill also adds to the $328 million funding backlog in the overall program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
