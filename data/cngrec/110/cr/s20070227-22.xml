  <speaking speaker="300019" topic="SERGEANT KEITH E. FISCUS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the life and service of Army SGT Keith E. Fiscus. Keith epitomized the best of our country's brave men and women who fought to free Iraq and to secure a new democracy in the Middle East. He exhibited unwavering courage, dutiful service to his country, and above all else, honor. In the way he lived his life--and how we remember him--Keith reminds each of us just how good we can be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keith was born to Pamela and Darrell Fiscus in Glendale, CA, in 1980. His family moved to Townsend, DE, in 1998. He was the second oldest of four children and is survived by an 18-year-old brother, Jordan, and two sisters, Korrie, 16, and Dena, 28. My heart goes out to each of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keith finished his senior year at Glasgow High School in Newark, DE, and graduated in 1998. After his graduation, Keith took a job in the produce department at Genuardi's supermarket in Glasgow, DE, and then worked as a customer service representative for a major credit card company. He enrolled in business classes at Delaware Technical &amp; Community College but soon decided that his interests didn't include sitting behind a desk in an office or classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by his grandparents' service in the Armed Forces, Keith joined the Army in 2002. After graduating from boot camp, he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division based out of Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. He was deployed to Iraq and served with distinction for the duration of his 14-month tour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving in Iraq, Keith decided to reenlist in the Army. After returning to the States, Keith received training on how to identify and disarm explosives. Keith volunteered to serve a second tour of duty in Iraq and was deployed again in August of 2006. He was scheduled to return home in February of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 2, 2006, Keith was serving as a machine gunner for an explosive ordinance disposal team on their way to clear a suspected roadside bomb near the city of Taji. An improvised explosive device was triggered near the humvee he was riding in, and Sergeant Fiscus was killed instantly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrary to his tough-looking tattoos and love of heavy metal music, Keith was a fun-loving, caring, and sensitive young man. He was described by those that knew him as a hopeless romantic who loved the camaraderie of the Army and spending time with family and friends. He was also an avid golfer and fisherman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Fiscus was also an excellent soldier. He was an expert rifleman who received numerous recognitions during his Army career: Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and Combat Infantryman Badge. The Purple Heart and the Bronze Star were awarded posthumously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to commemorate Keith, to celebrate his life, and to offer his family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I would like to honor SPC Travis Vaughn, who died on February 18, 2007, in a helicopter crash while fighting in Afghanistan. A Cedar Falls, IA, native, Travis served proudly and with distinction during Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With bravery and valor, Travis accepted the call to defend America against those who seek to undermine our values, our democracy, and our way of life. In Afghanistan, he and others from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment out of Fort Campbell, KY, served their country in a dangerous part of the world, helping to make the rest of the world a safer place. Sadly, Travis's service to his country cost him his life, forever earning him the gratitude of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Travis is remembered fondly and will be greatly missed. A longtime friend of Travis recently said of him, "He was always there to help anybody that he could and do whatever he could to make people happy." Still other friends recalled Travis's fondness for adventurous recreational activities. These qualities made Travis well-suited for military service, and certainly we were fortunate to have a man of such drive and ability serving in the U.S. Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all Iowans and people throughout this country, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Travis Vaughn's friends and family. In particular, my thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Heather, his stepson Taylin, his father Brad, and mother Christine. They should know that the entire Nation stands behind them during this time of mourning. His loss is  indeed tragic, but he will be remembered as a hero and a patriot.</paragraph>
