  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to discuss the need to make access to health insurance for everyone a priority in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, 46 million Americans are uninsured, including more than 9 million children in the U.S. One in three people in the San Gabriel Valley, which I represent, is uninsured; and across the State of California, 6.5 million adults and 750,000 children lack health care insurance. Nationwide, 83 percent of the uninsured are from working families. Of uninsured Californians, more than two-thirds of those families have full-time jobs. Fourteen million uninsured are Latinos, including one in five  children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 5 years, the number of Latinos without health insurance, as you know, has increased. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, uninsured children are five times less likely to have visited a doctor or dentist in the past 2 years compared to those children who are insured. Fewer doctor visits can lead to serious illness and health problems, as well as avoidable costly emergency room visits. The Institute of Medicine estimates that each year at least 18,000 people die prematurely due  to lack of health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But President Bush's proposal will not help the 46 million uninsured men, women, and children in our country. Instead of finding real solutions, President Bush wants to provide tax deductions to wealthy Americans who can already afford their health care insurance. Tax deductions, as you know, will not solve the real problem of skyrocketing health care costs. Tax deductions will not make it easier for low-income families and middle-class working families to purchase health care insurance. In fact,  as you know, our families may be better off without the President's so-called help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Families USA, President Bush's plan is "like throwing a 50-foot rope to someone in a 40-foot hole." And for the majority of uninsured people, his plan is like throwing them nothing at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People without employer-sponsored coverage, such as people who work in small businesses, who make up the majority of those individuals in some of our districts, will not benefit from Bush's tax breaks. Even White House officials admit that only 3 to 5 million uninsured people would actually become insured under Bush's proposal. The President's plan, as you know, fails to relieve the problems that most uninsured adults and children face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to do better for the American people. And we must ensure that everyone has access to affordable and quality health care insurance and that programs are easily accessible by all. Programs such as the State Children's Health Insurance Programs, as you know, are very important. We call them the SCHIP program, and in the State of California they are known as the Healthy Families Program. Across the Nation, Medicaid and SCHIP provide coverage for more than 34 million children. These programs  must be adequately funded and include needed tools to reach all eligible populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as you know, millions more children are eligible for these programs but are not enrolled. In fact, 74 percent of the uninsured children are eligible but are not somehow showing up on these enrollment applications. Many are low income. They come from families that are poor and unaware of the fact that they are eligible even for these services. And recent research shows that the SCHIP program may be failing to reach the hardest to reach subpopulations of the uninsured children like Latinos.  And according to Families USA, distrust of the health care system, language, culture, these are all barriers that are confusing to our families, and those eligibility rules are high obstacles for families to enroll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Community health care workers, such as the promotoras, play key roles in overcoming these barriers to enrollment for public programs. Promotoras, as you know, exist in the State of California and along the frontera, along the border on the U.S. side. They are qualified people who could help patients access and navigate the complex and confusing health care system. They can reach racial and ethnic minorities that would otherwise remain locked out of our system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent report by the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics compared the effectiveness of community workers with traditional Medicaid and SCHIP outreach enrollment. The report found that families who interacted with community health workers such as the promotoras were eight times more likely to obtain health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Almost 96 percent of children who work with promotoras in the study obtained health insurance. Seventy-eight percent were insured continuously. The study provides that community health workers can reduce the number of uninsured children, and we should move forward asking for the SCHIP program to also provide for assistance through the promotoras program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the gentlewoman from California understands what I am talking about, because those promotoras also exist in her district as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to make sure that President Bush plans for a significant funds for those children that are uninsured, and I would ask that our colleagues please continue to provide funding for the SCHIP program and to expand that in those needed areas.</paragraph>
