    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I announce to the Senate that one of Iowa's own, PFC Katie Soenksen of Davenport, has given her life in service to her country in Iraq. My thoughts and prayers are with her parents, Mary Ann and Ronald Soenksen, her brother and sister, and all her family and friends as they grieve her loss. Katie is one of many members of her extended family who have served their country in the military, and she felt a calling to military service. She  even visited her former high school, Davenport North, to recruit for the Army. She joined the Army knowing full well what sacrifices she might be asked to make, but she believed in what she was doing and in her mission in Iraq. Katie kept in regular contact with her family and reported about the tremendous good she and her fellow soldiers were doing to make better the lives of everyday Iraqis. Certainly the Iraqi citizens whose lives she helped to improve, as well as all Americans,</paragraph>
