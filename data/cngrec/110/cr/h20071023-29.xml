  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a very serious note, and I won't take the hour, I want to apologize to, first of all, my colleagues, many of whom I have offended, to the President, to his family, to the troops that may have found in my remarks, as were suggested in the motion that we just voted on, and I do apologize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this reason, I think that we have a serious issue before us, the issue of providing medical care to children, the issue of what we do about a war that we are divided about how to end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that with this apology, I will become as insignificant as I should be and that we can return to the issues that do divide us, but that we can resolve in a better fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
