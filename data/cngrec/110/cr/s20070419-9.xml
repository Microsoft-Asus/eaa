    <paragraph>Let me say to my good friend, the majority leader, I think there is an excellent chance of finishing the court security bill fairly soon. He is, indeed, correct that the competitiveness bill which he is calling up after that enjoys broad bipartisan support, so I think these are two pieces of legislation the Senate has a good chance of enacting in the very near future.</paragraph>
