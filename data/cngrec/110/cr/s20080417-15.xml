    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in today's Record a detailed speech. I was privileged to go to the White House on Monday, when the President celebrated, with many others, the 265th anniversary of Thomas Jefferson. Those remarks are so prized, particularly in my State, but all across America, that I wish to put the content of those speeches in today's Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>THE WHITE HOUSE,</narrative>
  <narrative>OFFICE OF THE PRESS SECRETARY,</narrative>
  <narrative>April 14, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Remarks by the President and First Lady in Honor of Thomas Jefferson's 265th Birthday</narrative>
  <narrative>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. Thanks for coming. Please be seated. Welcome to the White House. Laura and I are so honored you are here. I welcome members of my Cabinet, members of the United States Senate, folks who work in the White House, the Governor of Virginia and Anne Holton. Thank you all for coming. We're really happy you're here.</narrative>
  <narrative>We're here tonight to commemorate the 265th birthday of Thomas Jefferson, here in a room where he once walked and in a home where he once lived. In this house, President Jefferson spread the word that liberty was the right of every individual. In this house, Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark off on the mission that helped make America a continental nation. And in this house, Jefferson was known to receive guests in his bathrobe and slippers. (Laughter.) Laura said no. (Laughter.) I don't have a  bathrobe. (Laughter.)</narrative>
  <narrative>With a single sentence, Thomas Jefferson changed the history of the world. After countless centuries when the powerful and the privileged governed as they pleased, Jefferson proclaimed as a self-evident truth that liberty was a right given to all people by an Almighty.</narrative>
  <narrative>Here in America, that truth was not fully realized in Jefferson's own lifetime. As he observed the condition of slaves in America, Jefferson said, "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just" and "that his justice cannot sleep forever." Less than 40 years after his death, justice was awakened in America and a new era of freedom dawned.</narrative>
  <narrative>Today, on the banks of the Tidal Basin, a statue of Thomas Jefferson stands in a rotunda that is a memorial to both the man and the ideas that built this nation. There, on any day of the week, you will find men and women of all creeds, colors, races and religions. You will find scholars, schoolchildren and visitors from every part of our country. And you will find each of them looking upward in quiet reflection on the liturgy of freedom--the words of Thomas Jefferson inscribed on the memorial's  walls.</narrative>
  <narrative>The power of Jefferson's words do not stop at water's edge. They beckon the friends of liberty on even the most distant shores. They're a source of inspiration for people in young democracies like Afghanistan and Lebanon and Iraq. And they are a source of hope for people in nations like Belarus and Burma, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Syria, North Korea and Zimbabwe, where the struggle for freedom continues.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thomas Jefferson left us on July 4, 1826--fifty years to the day after our Declaration of Independence was adopted. In one of the great harmonies of history, his friend and rival John Adams died on the very same day. Adams' last words were, "Thomas Jefferson survives." And he still does today. And he will live on forever, because the desire to live in freedom is the eternal hope of mankind.</narrative>
  <narrative>And now it's my pleasure to welcome Wilfred McClay to the stage. (Applause.)</narrative>
  <narrative>MRS. BUSH: Thank you very much, Mr. McClay and Mr. Wilson. Thank you so--for your reflections on Thomas Jefferson's life and his contributions to our nation, and thanks to each of you for joining us today so we can learn more about the legacy of one of America's most influential founding fathers.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thomas Jefferson believed that education is the cornerstone of a free society, so it's therefore little surprise that he viewed the founding of the University of Virginia as one of his top achievements, as we know from both of your talks. He called the building of this school the last service he could render his country, saying, "Could I see it open? I would not ask an hour more of life."</narrative>
  <narrative>But in fact Thomas Jefferson lived a little over a year after the University of Virginia opened its doors. During this time he was involved in the University activities, and he invited students, including a young Edgar Allan Poe, to dine with him each Sunday at nearby Monticello.</narrative>
  <narrative>Today, Jefferson still shapes the lives of the students at the school he founded. The architecture of his academical village encourages free study in a collaborative environment, and UVA's philosophy of student self-governance epitomizes our third President's democratic ideals.</narrative>
  <narrative>The 18 men I now introduce are heirs to this tradition. The Virginia Gentlemen are UVA's oldest a cappella vocal ensemble. They perform for distinguished audiences across the country and around the world. Tonight is their first performance at the White House, and we're happy to have them.</narrative>
  <narrative>Here to perform a few musical selections, including the University of Virginia's school song, please welcome the Virginia Gentlemen. (Applause.)</narrative>

  <narrative>RICHARD GUY WILSON,</narrative>
  <narrative>COMMONWEALTH PROFESSOR, ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY,</narrative>
  <narrative>University of Virginia.</narrative>
  <narrative>MR. PRESIDENT, MRS. BUSH, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Thank you--an honor to speak on Thomas Jefferson and his architectural accomplishments. Thomas Jefferson knew this house very well,--he was the first full time occupant--John Adams resided here for barely 4 months. The house remained unfinished, many rooms--such as this one, were large bare brick caverns, there was no grand staircase, and the floors were rough. Visitors recalled that Jefferson kept several tables of tools ..... one apparently  in this room ..... described as "a long table" that contained hammers, chisels, and other implements, and the visitors remember him taking the tools to fix locks, pound in nails in window moldings as well as work in the garden.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jefferson had offered his own designs for the Executive Mansion or President's house as it was known back in 1791-92, along with plans for the U.S. Capitol; this he projected as a great domed structure. But Washington, apparently, rejected his schemes and competitions were held. Jefferson served as secretary of state in the 1st Washington administration and that office--Secretary of State--was a bit different than today, since it included internal administration as well as foreign affairs. Jefferson  also offered his scheme for laying out Washington, D.C., (remember this is a "new city" and created in the 1790s) and Jefferson's advice ..... not to mention his loan of maps ..... is fundamental to the plan along with the great mall developed by Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant.</narrative>
  <narrative>To return here to this building--the White House--(officially so named in 1901), Jefferson while president designed a number of additions including wings, the gardens, and then he commissioned his close friend Benjamin Henry Latrobe--who he also appointed in 1803 as the Architect of the Capitol--to design both the north and south porticos; Latrobe's porticos are the most distinguishing external element of the building. It took many years to get the porticos built ..... things were not that different  then as now on getting government projects underway, and finished.</narrative>
  <narrative>I have outlined Thomas Jefferson's involvement in this building to make a point,--the buildings he lived in, their style, appearance, the furnishings--rugs, drapes, chairs--and gardens were critical to him. As he once said: "Architecture is my delight, and putting up and pulling down one of my favorite amusements." Jefferson was obsessed, wherever he lived, whether in Charlottesville, Williamsburg, or Poplar Forest, all in Virginia, or in Philadelphia during the 1770s, New York, 1790s, or Paris,  1784-89. When he was the American Ambassador to the Court of Louis XVI, he remodeled his quarters even though he didn't own them. Monticello was in a constant state of construction, and if any of you have lived through a house remodeling, you know how conducive that is to family harmony. Right? Jefferson lived in a construction zone his entire life.</narrative>
  <narrative>What were Jefferson's architectural achievements? He wrote to his close friend James Madison (later an occupant of this building):</narrative>
  <narrative>"But how is a taste in the beautiful art to be formed in our countrymen, unless we avail ourselves of every occasion when public buildings are to be erected, of presenting to them models for their study and imitation? ....... You see I am an enthusiast on the subject of the arts. But it is an enthusiasm of which I am not ashamed, as its object is to improve the taste of my countrymen, to increase their reputation, to reconcile them to the rest of the world, and procure them its praise." TJ  to James Madison, September 20, 1785.</narrative>
  <narrative>This letter of 1785 was on the occasion of his design of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond. I would argue the Virginia Capitol--or state house--is his most important building, a large Roman temple that stands on Shockoe Hill in Richmond--originally overlooking the James River. The Virginia Capitol is one of the first major public building constructed after the Revolution, and its classical ancestry helped to determine the look of American governmental architecture for the next several centuries.  Instead of red brick and skimpy classical details Jefferson gave us a governmental image.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thomas Jefferson is sometimes labeled a "gentleman" or an "amateur" architect but this is a misnomer. Yes, he was self-trained, but there were no architectural schools (they were not invented in this country until the 1860s), rather he learned from books and he had the largest architectural library in the young republic, and he did the drawings, he figured the specifications ..... How many bricks? How much timber? How much glass to order, and he superintended the construction. Jefferson designed  houses, his own and those for friends, utilitarian buildings such as shops, farm structures, court houses, a jail (we think) and he frequently offered his wisdom to his colleagues (he was "Mr. Suggestion Box"). But ..... and this makes him an amateur ..... he was never paid, he did it all gratis.</narrative>
  <narrative>Although the Virginia State Capitol is his most important building--because of its legacy.....his greatest I would argue--is the "academical village," of the University of Virginia. It is totally his creation--yes ..... he did ask for suggestions and advice--as any wise person does--but it was or is his concept of what is the appropriate setting for education. Jefferson felt that one learned as much from your environment as from the professor gabbing away in a class room. The University is  great lawn enclosed on 3 sides and open at the end. Pavilions for the professors and dormitory rooms for the students on the two long sides are tied together by colonnades of classical columns of various orders and sizes. Dominating the composition at one end is the Rotunda, a great domed building that housed the library. Based upon the Pantheon in Rome, considered one of the great and</narrative>
  <narrative>Jefferson saw his accomplishments in a very particular way, and he both designed his obelisk shaped tombstone at Monticello and ordered it would contain a very particular statement ..... (He was "Mr. Control" to the end). It contains nothing, nothing ..... about public offices he had occupied. What it does say is: "Here was buried Thomas Jefferson Author of the Declaration of American Independence of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and Father of the University of Virginia."  Two writings which are fundamental to our American freedoms and the institution by which they would be carried out.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jefferson Birthday Celebration Remarks</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Wilfred M. McClay, Apr. 14, 2008)</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you, Mr. President, for your warm welcome, and for the great honor of taking part in this celebration of Thomas Jefferson's life.</narrative>
  <narrative>It is always hard to know where to begin with Thomas Jefferson. His early biographer James Parton described Jefferson in 1775--one year before he wrote the Declaration of Independence--as "a gentleman of thirty-two, who could calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin." And at that point in his life, he was just getting warmed up.</narrative>
  <narrative>So how can we take his measure? Should we start by recounting his political accomplishments over four decades of public service, ranging from his entry into the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1769 to his retirement from public life in 1809, after two terms as the third President of the United States?</narrative>
  <narrative>Or do we stress instead his influence in the world of ideas, through his powerful writings in support of American independence--the greatest of these being, of course, the Declaration of Independence itself, with its stirring invocation of the God-given rights of every individual human being--words that changed the course of human history, and continue to do so today?</narrative>
  <narrative>Or Jefferson's keen and unflagging interest in natural science, as evidenced by his service as president of the American Philosophical Society from 1797 to 1815, years that overlap his entire tenure as President of the United States?</narrative>
  <narrative>Or his love of architecture, as embodied in the graceful neoclassical home Monticello that he designed and built for himself near his Virginia birthplace on what was then the western edge of settlement?</narrative>
  <narrative>Not to mention his overwhelming passion for gadgetry, which invariably impresses visitors to Monticello, who nearly always remember the revolving bookstand, the dumbwaiter, the copying machine, the automatic double doors, the Great Clock, the triple-sash window, and countless other gizmos that the ever-inventive Jefferson himself either designed or adapted.</narrative>
  <narrative>And what about his founding of the University of Virginia in nearby Charlottesville, whose serenely beautiful central grounds he also designed? Or his great contributions to the cause of religious and intellectual liberty, which for him were essential to the dignity of the individual person, and central to the work of a great university?</narrative>
  <narrative>You all probably know that Jefferson, that inveterate designer, even designed his own tombstone, and specified the only things it was to say about his life: that he wrote the Declaration and Virginia's Statute of Religious Freedom, and that he was Father of the University of Virginia. Of how many other men can it be said that their having served two full terms as President of the United States--which I think we all agree is no shabby achievement!--was in the second or third tier of their accomplishments?</narrative>
  <narrative>Some will object that all this praise fails to do justice to the flaws in our subject. And that is true enough. Should we then begin, as is overwhelmingly the fashion today, by emphasizing Jefferson's complexity, his contradictions, his shortcomings? That might not seem very charitable, or in keeping with the spirit of the occasion. But it would have the Jeffersonian virtue of honesty. And there are negative aspects of Jefferson's life and career that simply cannot be denied.</narrative>
  <narrative>No one can deny that although Jefferson opposed slavery in theory, he consistently failed to oppose it in practice, including notably in the conduct of his own life at Monticello.</narrative>
  <narrative>No one can deny that Jefferson's racial views, particularly as expressed in his book Notes on the State of Virginia, are appalling by today's standards.</narrative>
  <narrative>No one can deny that Jefferson often practiced a very harsh brand of politics. His famously conciliatory words "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists" in his First Inaugural Address were quickly belied by his ferocious partisanship, which was relentlessly aimed at stigmatizing the Federalist party and driving it out of existence.</narrative>
  <narrative>Nor can one deny that his greatest act as President, the Louisiana Purchase, and his worst, the Embargo Act, both represented a complete repudiation of his most basic principles about the dangers of big government and strong executive authority.</narrative>
  <narrative>These are not small flaws, nor are they the only ones. We are not wrong to insist upon their being remembered, even on this day. Still, the compulsion to criticize Jefferson has gone too far. Jefferson is, I believe, one of the principal victims of our era's small-minded rage against the very idea that imperfect men can still be heroes--and that we badly need such heroes. We have been living through an era that feels compelled to cut the storied past down to the size of the tabloid present. Perhaps  the time has come for that to change.</narrative>
  <narrative>For when all is said and done, Thomas Jefferson deserves to be remembered and revered as a great intellect and great patriot, whose worldwide influence, from Beijing to Lhasa to Kiev to Prague, has been incalculable, and whose belief in the dignity and unrealized potential to be found in the minds and hearts of ordinary people is at the core of what is greatest in the American democratic experiment. It is in this sense that James Parton was absolutely correct in making the following proclamation:</narrative>
  <narrative>Of course, we want to know more than Jefferson's words; we want to feel that we know the man himself. But that is exceptionally hard with Jefferson. He eludes our grasp. He may well have been the shyest man ever to occupy the office of President, awkward and  taciturn except in small and convivial settings, such as small dinner parties, where he could feel at his ease, and shed some of his reticence.</narrative>
  <narrative>He loathed public speaking, giving only two major speeches while President, and none on the campaign trail. He often felt that the work of politics ran against his nature, and complained that the Presidency was an office of "splendid misery," which "brings nothing but increasing drudgery &amp; daily loss of friends."</narrative>
  <narrative>Add to that the fact that he had more than a little bit of the recluse in him. Twice he withdrew entirely from public life, first in the 1780s, after a disappointing term as governor of Virginia, then the second time at the conclusion of his presidency, when he left Washington disgusted and exhausted, anxious to be rid of the place. As he wrote a friend, "Never did a prisoner, released from his chains, feel such relief as I shall on shaking off the shackles of power." Never was he happier than  when ensconced in his Monticello retreat, his "portico facing the wilderness" that he loved and found renewal in.</narrative>
  <narrative>At bottom, I think Jefferson is best understood as a man of letters. Literally. Jefferson wrote almost 20,000 letters in his lifetime, and it is in these letters that he seems to have felt freest and most fully himself. Although he complained to John Adams that he suffered "under the persecution of letters," the opposite seems to have been the case. This was a man who lived much of his life inside his own head, and it is in these letters that he comes most fully alive for us. He seems to have  needed the buffer of letters interposed between himself and the world; but with that buffer in place, the otherwise awkward and taciturn Jefferson became more open, wonderfully expressive and responsive to his correspondents.</narrative>
  <narrative>It was in his letters to Maria Cosway that we glimpse his passionate nature, and the struggles between head and heart that preoccupied much of his inner life. It is in his letters to his nephew Peter Carr that we see his thoughts as a preceptor and wise guide to the world's ways. And it was in his magnificent correspondence with his old rival John Adams, a dialogue that spanned fifty years until their deaths in 1826, that Jefferson most fully explored the deeper meaning of the American experiment.  He was constantly using his correspondence to organize and sharpen his thinking, and it is there that we see him most fully and vividly.</narrative>
  <narrative>In any event, it is for his ideas, above all else, that we honor Jefferson; and for the cause of human freedom and human dignity that he so eloquently championed. His failings may weigh against the man, but not against the cause for which he labored so mightily. That should be a lesson to us today. Like Jefferson, we are carriers of meanings far larger than we know, meanings whose full realization cannot be achieved in our lifetime, or even be fully understood by us, but which we are nevertheless  charged to carry forward as faithfully as we can.</narrative>
  <narrative>But unlike Jefferson, we have the benefit of being able to stand on his shoulders, with his words to direct and inspire us. "We knew" about Jefferson's faults, said the civil rights leader, Representative John Lewis. "But we didn't put the emphasis there. We put the emphasis on what he wrote in the Declaration....... His words were so powerful. His words became the blueprint, the guideline for us to follow. From those words you have the fountain."</narrative>
  <narrative>It is the same fountain that today, 265 years after Jefferson's birth, still nourishes our lives, and shows no sign of running dry. Today is a good day to drink from it anew.</narrative>
