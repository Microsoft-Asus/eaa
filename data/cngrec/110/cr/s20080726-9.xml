  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 894, <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>. With that, I send a cloture motion to the desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Cloture Motion</chair>
  <chair>We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 894, <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>, the Advancing America's Priorities Act.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, pursuant to rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief based upon information provided to me by the committees of jurisdiction, <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> does not contain any congressionally directed spending item, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit, as those terms are defined in rule XLIV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no tax or tariff provisions in the bill whatsoever. Nor do I believe the bill contains any "congressionally directed spending items" which rule XLIV defines as "a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Senator providing, authorizing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or  targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To clear up any misconceptions, the bill provides only authorizations--enactment of the bills would have no effect on the Federal budget deficit or debt. As the nonpartisan CBO stated in a letter regarding <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>, "By themselves--that is, in the absence of subsequent legislation--those authorizations [in <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>] do not cause changes in Federal spending or revenues." I wish to ask that a copy of this and a related CBO letter be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a formal matter, no provision of <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> could qualify as a congressionally directed spending item under rule XLIV because no provision was added "primarily at the request of a Senator." <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> is a compilation of bills identified by my staff as meeting the following criteria: No. 1. the other Chamber has approved companion legislation; No. 2. the Senate committee of jurisdiction supports the bill, e.g., by approving it in Committee, by assenting to a "hotline," et cetera; No. 3. the  bill has broad bipartisan support, and No. 4, to the best of our knowledge the only impediment to enacting the bill was the obstruction of a single Member of the Senate. Bills were included in the package because they met these criteria, not "primarily at the request of a Senator."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only item in the package that does not meet all of these criteria is the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act, <bill type="s" number="1810">S. 1810</bill>, introduced by Senator Brownback and cosponsored by Senator Kennedy, because it has not yet been passed by the House. Senator Brownback requested inclusion of the provision in the package, Senator Kennedy supported the bill, and it apparently has broad bipartisan support. No provision of that act could be considered  a congressionally directed spending item, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But because the spirit of transparency underlying rule XLIV is not served by such a formal approach, my staff asked the committees of jurisdiction to identify any item that might be considered a congressionally directed spending item in the respective bills as considered by committee. Each committee indicated that it did not believe any item included in <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> within its respective jurisdiction meets the definition of a congressionally directed spending item.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Advancing America's Priorities Act includes many important bills, including the following: a bill to promote research into and better care for those suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease; a bill to promote research into and better care for Americans suffering paralysis, a healthcare problem all too prevalent among our brave veterans; a bill to promote research into and better care for individuals who suffer strokes; a bill to promote research into and awareness of postpartum depression; several  bills to protect children from exploitation and to crack down on child pornography; several bills to reauthorize successful U.S. foreign policy programs; a bill to promote the safety of families enjoying America's beaches; a bill to help increase the availability</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To avoid specious arguments that distract from the substance of these important bills, and in the interest of the broadest possible transparency, I provide here information about each of the items that even might be alleged to be a congressionally directed spending item.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One subtitle in the bill, title VI, subtitle A, authorizes $1.5 billion in funding for capital investments and preventive maintenance projects for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, an authority established pursuant to a compact provided for under Federal law. Over 40 percent of the Washington Metro ridership consists of Federal employees. The Government relies upon Metro for transporting the millions of tourists who visit the Nation's Capital each year, for special events, and  for evacuation planning. Since the Metro was first built, the Federal Government has made capital investments in the Metro on three separate occasions: 1969, 1980, and 1990. Apparently, a Republican Senator is claiming this subtitle constitutes an "earmark." Assuming that the term "earmark" is intended to be synonymous with "congressionally directed spending item," this claim appears to be inaccurate. Under this theory of what constitutes a "congressionally</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another item in the bill, title VII, authorizes $12 million for the Smithsonian Institution to construct a greenhouse facility at its museum support facility in Suitland, MD. The lease on the greenhouse currently used by the Smithsonian Institution expires next May. If the Smithsonian Institution does not obtain a new greenhouse facility, it will have to find a way to dispose of the scientifically important National Orchid Collection, over 11,000 orchids, many of which are extinct or threatened  in the wild. Further, the greenhouse is important to the historic gardens surrounding the Smithsonian Museums. The provision would not appear to meet the definition of a congressionally directed spending item in any event because it is a House-originated item, the House committee noted that the legislation was requested by the Smithsonian Institution--the authorization is directed to a Federal trust instrumentality, and money appropriated under</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One bill in the package--title V, subtitle B, part II, subpart B--authorizes funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to advance undersea technology through the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. This technology supports NOAA's Undersea Research Program's, NURP's, regional centers. The National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology was established in 2002 at the University of Mississippi--Oxford, MS--and the University of Southern Mississippi--Stennis  Space Center, MS--in partnership with NURP's. The National Technology Institute and undersea regional centers undergo periodic external review. According to the best information available to me, funds under the provision would be administered through a competitive award process, and therefore this provision would not appear to constitute a congressionally directed spending item. A similar provision in a House</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, another item in the bill authorizes $5 million in funding for the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Title IV, subtitle F. This provision would not appear to meet the Rule XLIV definition of "congressionally directed spending item" as it is a House-originated item, there is no indication that the House treated it as containing an earmark under equivalent House rules, and it is clear that support for the provision is based on widespread agreement with the policy underlying it, not  parochial interests--the House bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 407 to 13. The provision was not included at the request of a Senator; it was included because it satisfied the criteria noted above.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the two letters to which I referred printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative/>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. LEADER: The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>, a bill to advance America's priorities, as introduced on July 22, 2008. The bill includes numerous provisions that would affect health care, criminal statutes, laws to protect wildlife and the environment, international aid programs, efforts to promote commerce, ocean research, and other government programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Most of the bill's provisions would specifically or implicitly authorize increased appropriations for purposes specified in the bill. By themselves--that is, in the absence of subsequent legislation--those authorizations do not cause changes in federal spending or revenues.</narrative>
  <narrative>Although CBO has not completed a comprehensive review of <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>, we have previously prepared cost estimates for numerous pieces of legislation that are similar or identical to most of the major provisions in this bill. Based on those previous estimates and on a preliminary review of <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill>, CBO estimates that, in total, the bill would authorize the appropriation of approximately $10 billion over the 2009-2013 period. CBO estimates that, if those sums are appropriated in future legislation,  implementing the bill would cost about $8 billion over the 2009-2013 period.</narrative>
  <narrative>Some provisions of <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> would establish new federal crimes. Because those prosecuted and convicted under <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> could be subject to criminal fines, the federal government might collect additional fines if the legislation is enacted. Criminal fines are recorded as revenues, then deposited in the Crime Victims Fund, and later spent. CBO expects that any additional revenues and direct spending would not be significant because of the relatively small number of cases affected.</narrative>
  <narrative><bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would impose a private-sector mandate on certain entities that handle nonhuman primates, but CBO expects that the cost of the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($136 million in 2008, adjusted for inflation).</narrative>
  <narrative>If you wish any further details, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Kim Cawley.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Peter R. Orszag,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative/>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This letter responds to the questions you posed on July 17, 2008, about the impact on the federal budget from enacting legislation that authorizes future appropriations but does not affect direct spending or revenues. Consequently, this letter does not address legislation that would permit agencies to incur obligations in advance of appropriations (for example, legislation providing new contract authority).</narrative>
  <narrative>Question #1: Does an authorization of future appropriations provide the authority for federal programs or agencies to incur obligations and make payments from the Treasury?</narrative>
  <narrative>Answer: No. A simple authorization of appropriations does not provide an agency with the authority to incur obligations or make payments from the Treasury.</narrative>
  <narrative>Question #2: Can an agency or program spend money without the authority from Congress to incur obligations and make payments from the Treasury?</narrative>
  <narrative>Answer: No. An agency is not allowed to spend money without the proper authority from Congress to incur obligations. (See 31 U.S.C. &#xA7;1341, which outlines limitations on expending and obligating funds by officers and employees of the United States Government.)</narrative>
  <narrative>Question #3: Even if legislation authorizes appropriations for a program, isn't it the case that a subsequent act of Congress is required before an agency can spend money pursuant to the authorization?</narrative>
  <narrative>Answer: Yes. For discretionary programs created through an authorization, the authority to incur obligations is usually provided in a subsequent appropriations act. An agency must have such an appropriation before it can incur obligations. (Legislation other than appropriation acts that provides such authority is shown as increasing direct spending.)</narrative>
  <narrative>Question #4: If no new spending can occur under the authorizing legislation, does it have the effect of increasing the federal deficit and/or reducing the federal surplus?</narrative>
  <narrative>Answer: No. An authorization of appropriations, by itself, does not increase federal deficits or decrease surpluses. However, any subsequent appropriation to fund the authorized activity would affect the federal budget.</narrative>
  <narrative>Question #5: Would CBO's projection of federal debt change as a result of enacting legislation that only authorizes future appropriations? Is it not correct that the agency's projection of future debt would be identical both before and after the enactment of such legislation?</narrative>
  <narrative>Answer: Enacting legislation that only authorizes future appropriations would not result in an increase in CBO's projection of federal debt under its baseline assumptions.</narrative>
  <narrative>I hope this information is useful to you.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do not believe that the provisions of title VI, subtitle A of <bill type="s" number="3297">S. 3297</bill> corresponding to the National Capital Transportation Amendments Act constitute a "congressionally directed spending item."
