  <narrative>THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007 -- (Senate - December 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15768">S15768</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early in the morning of December 8, 2007, 25-year-old Nathaniel Salerno was attacked by five to seven men on a Washington, DC, Metro subway train. Salerno, a gay man, had been at several clubs prior to returning home. Shortly after boarding the train, the men approached him and allegedly demanded that Salerno give them his wallet and BlackBerry. When he stood up, the attackers snatched the items and began to punch and kick him, screaming antigay slurs. Salerno received stitches for the lacerations  he received to his face during the attack. Washington's Metro police are investigating the assault as a bias-related violent crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
