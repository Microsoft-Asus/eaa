    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5975">H.R. 5975</bill>, to rename the post office in Waterville, New York in memory of Corporal John P. Sigsbee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with both incredible pride and sadness that I address the House today to speak on this bill that pays tribute to the life and sacrifice of one of this Nation's fallen soldiers, U.S. Army Corporal John Sigsbee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 16, 2008, Corporal Sigsbee of Waterville, New York was killed in action 50 miles north of Baghdad during his second tour of duty in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The family he left behind while in the line of duty will soon receive his second Military Purple Heart on his behalf. Corporal Sigsbee was only 21 years old when his life was taken in service of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Sigsbee graduated from Waterville Central School in 2004 and attended Mohawk Valley Community College. Upon completing his first year of college, John decided to join the U.S. Army to further finance his higher education and became wounded one month to the day during his first tour of duty in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John was sent home to recover at the Brooke Army Medical Center, where he was visited by Army personnel who awarded him for his bravery. These officers told John that he needed time to heal properly from the burns he suffered when his tank drove over two IEDs, and that he needed time to consider his decision to return to service. However, John replied, with his mother at his side, "Give me one year and I'll be back." John did just that, and it was then that his mother started to know what "sacrifice"  truly means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John went back and gave all that he had to give. In his mind, there was no question that his place was back with his fellow troops in Iraq to fulfill his responsibilities as a young American soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Sigsbee valiantly served as a member of the 32nd Cavalry Unit in the 101st Airborne Division, a dedicated young man who every day honored his responsibility to his country and his mission. Corporal Sigsbee's purpose and sacrifices will be remembered by the entire village of Waterville, county of Oneida and now, with passage of this bill, by the whole Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During calling hours and funeral arrangements for Corporal Sigsbee, his family and loved ones received an outpouring of gratitude and support by the village of Waterville. Over 2,000 citizens attended calling hours to pay their respects for this young American, and 300 members from local veterans' organizations came to the local high school as a show of strength and unity for their fellow soldier. Additionally, a 50-car procession escorted his body from the Griffiss Airfield to Saratoga National  Cemetery where he was laid to rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that day, January 25, 2008, Corporal Sigsbee received a true hero's welcome from not only his family and friends, but from people who did not know him yet wanted to give their thanks, thanks to a man who paid the ultimate price for their safety and their freedom. The renaming of this post office may be considered by some as a simple act by Congress. But it will forever symbolize to the village of Waterville and the citizens of Oneida County, and to future generations, the deep appreciation  that this legislative body has for this man's life and contributions, and for the actions of each and every member of our Armed Services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues today to support this legislation renaming the Waterville, New York, Post Office after and in honor of Corporal  John P. Sigsbee and to forever honor the life of this soldier, son, brother and American hero.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5975">H.R. 5975</bill>, designating the post office in Waterville, New York, as the Corporal John P. Sigsbee Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In October 2005, Corporal Sigsbee joined the 101st Airborne Division 32nd Cavalry Unit, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, famously known as the home of the Screaming Eagles. After being deployed to Iraq, he was injured by a roadside bomb in July 2006. For his action, he was honored with the Purple Heart. After recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center, he insisted on returning to Iraq. Steve English, one of Corporal Sigsbee's high school teachers, said, "John was doing something he knew was important.  After being injured, he could have chosen to be assigned anywhere. He chose Iraq." English noted that it was indeed Corporal Sigsbee's commitment to his fellow soldiers that drove him to return to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, during his second deployment, Corporal Sigsbee was killed in action on January 16, 2008, along with two other American soldiers when they came under small arms fire and grenade attack in Balad. He was posthumously honored with a bronze star for his service and a promotion to the rank of corporal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal John Patrick Sigsbee's life and tragic death have served as a rallying point for his community of Waterville, New York. By naming the new post office in his hometown after this brave young American, we will establish not only a permanent monument for this fallen soldier, but a permanent reminder of his example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise to join my colleagues in the consideration and support of <bill type="h" number="5975">H.R. 5975</bill>, which renames a postal facility in Waterville, New York, after Corporal John P. Sigsbee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure being considered was first introduced by Congressman Michael Arcuri of New York on May 6, 2008, and is cosponsored by all members of the Empire State, the New York delegation. Upon introduction the measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and on June 12, 2008, our committee approved the bill by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5975">H.R. 5975</bill> allows us to pay homage to the service of Corporal John P. Sigsbee who was tragically killed on January 16 while serving in Balad, Iraq. Corporal Sigsbee died as a result of wounds sustained from grenade and small-arms fire during combat operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Assigned to the 1st Squadron, 32nd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Corporal Sigsbee joined the Army in October, 2005, and served his country valiantly up until the time of his death. For making the ultimate sacrifice of life, Corporal Sigsbee was awarded the Purple Heart which now rests with his parents, James and Susan Sigsbee, of Waterville, New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we pay tribute to this heroic American citizen, let us also take a moment and recollect on the thousands of men and women in uniform currently serving abroad in order to protect us here in the homeland. I ask that we all proudly commemorate both the life and the unfortunate death of Corporal John P. Sigsbee by passing <bill type="h" number="5975">H.R. 5975</bill>.</paragraph>
