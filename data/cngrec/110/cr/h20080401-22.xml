    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, three members of the Army National Guard's 1132nd Military Police Company based in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, were recently killed in support of our Operation Iraqi Freedom after an improvised explosive device detonated near their vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-seven-year old Sergeant David B. "Blake" Williams, of Tarboro, North Carolina, was from my district. He was serving a second tour of duty in Iraq, and was recently awarded a second Army Commendation Medal for his exceptional service during combat duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few moments ago, Madam Speaker, I spoke to Susan Legett Williams, the mother, and Mary Beth Williams, the sister, to express not only sympathy from the Congress of the United States of America but to express appreciation from a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God bless the entire Williams family during this difficult time in their lives.</paragraph>
