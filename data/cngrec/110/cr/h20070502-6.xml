    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the list of Republicans under investigation or resigning in this administration in disgrace keeps growing. This morning, The Washington Post reported Julie A. MacDonald, the deputy assistant Secretary of the Interior Department, resigned, just as she was being investigated for changing scientific reports to protect the interests of oil and gas companies and real estate developers, all the people she was supposed to be actually holding accountable. I wish this was an  isolated case in the Bush administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, The New York Times reported the Department of Commerce Inspector General faces three separate investigations in conduct of his office. Scott Block, the special counsel of the Justice Department, is being investigated for the management of his office. Lucita Doan at the GSA is being investigated for politicization of the office. Monica Goodling of the Justice Department resigned. Sue Ellen Wooldridge at Justice stepped down. Matteo Fontana at the Department of Education has stepped  aside. David Safavian at OMB has been prosecuted. Stephen Giles at the Interior Department had to step down. All have had their conduct scrutinized while in their professional office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time, in fact, and justifies why this Congress is doing its job of oversight and accountability, and bringing people's professional conduct in order.</paragraph>
