    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the very last day of the  month of February, which is Black History Month, and today I rise to thank the many Members who have supported <bill type="hr" number="198">H. Res. 198</bill>, which recognizes the significance of Black History Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This piece of legislation is supported by conservatives, moderates and liberals. It is a piece of legislation that I received not one negative comment on. Every person that we requested agreed to support the legislation. So I thank those who supported it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also, Mr. Speaker, want to apologize to the many that I did not approach and ask for support because my belief is that this kind of legislation will receive the support of all persons of goodwill. African Americans in the diaspora in America merit this kind of support. The Members of this House have given it to African Americans and to persons of goodwill, and I thank them all.</paragraph>
