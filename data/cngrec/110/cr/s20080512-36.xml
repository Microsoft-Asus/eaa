    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the soldiers and civilian employees at Fort A.P. Hill for winning the Army Chief of Staff Communities of Excellence Award competition for fiscal year 2008. This prestigious annual award recognizes the tremendous effort made by Fort A.P. Hill to support soldiers, civilian employees, retirees, and their families. In addition, it highlights the superior business practices that have sparked innovation and enhanced efficiency at the installation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort A.P. Hill, as one of the Army's premier installations, has also achieved high marks in this competition in the past, finishing in third place each of the last 3 years. This year, the post hosted a week long visit by a team of evaluators who reviewed every facet of Fort A.P. Hill's operations. Following a scoring assessment by a panel of judges, Fort A.P. Hill was named the competition winner and was awarded $2 million to continue efforts to improve the post.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With nearly 76,000 acres, including a 27,000-acre live fire complex that hosts personnel from every service in the Armed Forces, Fort A.P. Hill is rightly known as "The Place Where America's Military Sharpens Its Combat Edge." I offer my congratulations for a job well done to Fort A.P. Hill's outstanding team.</paragraph>
