  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="ALLEN" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to express my continued support for the Employee Free Choice Act, a bill which the House passed 2 weeks ago which I hope the Senate will soon consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to support House passage of the Employee Free Choice Act because I believe that the current law places undue burdens on workers who are trying to exercise their rights to organize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current law, workers are often subject to intimidation, and employers receive a slap on the hand for illegal activities. One study recently conducted by the University of Illinois found that 30 percent of employers fire pro-union workers, 49 percent threaten to close a work site, and 51 percent coerce employees with bribes or favoritism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of these acts, many workers are afraid to vote for a union against the wishes of their employer, even in private.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If those statistics are not compelling enough, I urge my colleagues to consider the fact that the United States is the only industrialized Nation to have a union avoidance industry of any size. This industry, on which corporations spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, exists solely to help businesses resist unionization efforts and undermine union strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act would close the legal and illegal avenues to intimidation that some employers use, thereby strengthening employees' ability to choose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would discourage the firing of employees by increasing fines and penalties during the election process. It would guarantee that first contract negotiations don't drag out for years by requiring mediation and arbitration to end delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employee Free Choice Act would allow the use of card check procedures, in which a majority of workers, not just a majority of voters, sign cards authorizing a union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is it so important to ensure access to unions? Inequality is rising in our country. Two years ago, Alan Greenspan said: "A free market society is ill served by an economy in which the rewards are distributed in a way which too many of our population do not feel is appropriate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether or not you agree that increasing inequality in our country is tied to declining union membership, one thing is clear: unionized workers have better rates of health care coverage, better wages, and are five times more likely to have a pension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Access to health care, better wages, secure pension: these are the things the House is trying to give back to the middle class in America. Making our economy work for everyone is a complicated, ongoing process. The Employee Free Choice Act is one important step we can take toward accomplishing that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many American workplaces, the process of forming a union is contentious. Yet, though they may differ over issues like wages, health care and pensions, employees, supervisors, and company owners are all striving for the same goal, to make their company work and for competitiveness in a global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finding a middle ground on questions of compensation, training and health care boosts American productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. When employers control the outcome, we not only cheat workers; we cheat our economic future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach 2020, our income distribution is trending toward that of 1920. Americans don't want to be left to the market-based whims of health savings accounts, privatized Social Security, or personal job retraining accounts. They want a government that ensures that individuals can provide for themselves and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Wagner wrote the National Labor Relations Act in 1934 to ensure that workers would have an unambiguous, unmitigated right to representation in the workplace. He said then that "the denial or observance of this right means the difference between despotism and democracy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate that the Employee Free Choice Act faces obstacles in the Senate, but it is time to give Americans a fair shot at organizing again. Everyone deserves protection under the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the Employee Free Choice Act.</paragraph>
