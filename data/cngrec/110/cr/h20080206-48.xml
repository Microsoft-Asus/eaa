  <narrative>EDWARD W. BROOKE III, UNITED STATES SENATOR, RETIRED -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H595]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I come to the floor for a special purpose this evening, a purpose that I think every Member of this House would want to join in during Black History Month. It is a rare bipartisan opportunity to honor a man whom I think Democrats and Republicans alike are equally proud of. He is a lifelong Republican, and yet, I, a lifelong Democrat, have come to ask Members to sign on to <bill type="h" number="1000">H.R. 1000</bill>, a bill to honor the first African American popularly elected to serve in the Senate  of the United States. You heard me. He was not a Democrat, he was a Republican, and his name is Edward W. Brooke III, United States Senator from Massachusetts, 1967 to 1979.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come during Black History Month because I think it would be a wonderful opportunity for the House on both sides of the aisle to do something together that both wanted to do, instead of simply talking about Black History Month in the abstract, doing something for a former Member of the United States Congress who indeed was African American. His service was of such quality that the President of the United States, several years ago, already awarded former Senator Brooke the highest national medal  that our government can offer, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the highest medal we can offer is the Congressional Gold Medal. The Senate, where Senator Brooke served, has already unanimously passed this resolution. This is a special time, I think, that the House would want to follow suit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to note, Madam Speaker, just how broad range was the support in the Senate. When you have Senator HARRY REID and MITCH MCCONNELL on the same bill to honor this former Senator, I think it says it all. When you have Senators ranging from Senator EDWARD KENNEDY to Senator TED STEVENS, I think that is the very definition of a bipartisan bill, and they were among the cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why did they do this? Why has Senator Brooke already gotten the highest medal that the President of the United States can offer? It is because of his distinguished career in the Senate; it is because he did a breakthrough at the time that breakthroughs were not even done; and it is because of his service in other ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He received the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Service Award, and the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit from the Italian Government for his leadership during 195 days in combat in Italy as a captain in World War II in the segregated 366th Combat Infantry Regiment. That, Madam Speaker, is the very definition of a patriot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, of course, know about Senator Brooke. This is perhaps somewhat personal to me, because he was born and raised in the District of Columbia. Mind you, his greatest service did not occur in this city as a native Washingtonian, but only in this city after he was elected to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was born and raised in segregated Washington, DC. The city was as segregated as any southern city then, including its public schools, the very public school from which I graduated as well, Dunbar High School. He was educated at Howard University and then went to Howard Law School, and hadn't left the District of Columbia until he went to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then somehow he realized there were greener pastures than his own hometown, and he went to Massachusetts to set up the practice of law and got the idea in his head that in a State with almost no African Americans, with almost no Democrats, he could get to be, first, the first black Attorney General in the United States, and then the first Senator elected by popular vote to the United States Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that it is very difficult for an African American or a person of any minority to be elected statewide. When this happened in the mid-sixties, I think we stand in awe of what kind of man it must have taken to have effected this change then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask Members if they will, before this month is over, and there are other Members trying to help me do so, join most of the Members of the House who have already signed on to <bill type="h" number="1000">H.R. 1000</bill> to award the Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
