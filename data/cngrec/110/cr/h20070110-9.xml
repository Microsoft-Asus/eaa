    <paragraph>It's time to raise the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I love America, and I want to make real the ideal expressed in the Pledge of Allegiance, liberty and justice for all. Justice not just for those who make more in a day than a minimum wage worker makes in a year, not just for those who are in, those who are in charge, in control, included, but justice also for those who are out, who are left out of the economic recovery, who are without health insurance, who are locked out of an apartment because they cannot afford to pay rent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the final analysis, the justness of America will not be determined by how we treat millionaires in the suites of life but, rather, how we treat minimum wage workers in the streets of life.</paragraph>
