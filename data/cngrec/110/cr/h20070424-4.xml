    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most solemn duties that we can have in the House of Representatives is to recognize the sacrifice, devotion and service of those who protect this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of Army Specialist Joey Cantrell, a soldier from Westwood, Kentucky, who recently lost his life fighting in Taji, Iraq, serving with the Army's Second Battalion, Eighth Cavalry Regiment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Cantrell graduated from Fairview High School in 2002 and was a celebrated athlete both on the football field and around the track. His football coach and mentor, Fairview school superintendent Bill Musick, told a local paper, "You always noticed Joey Cantrell because of how he presented himself. He was a sharp kid." Joey overcame adversity, achieved academic excellence, was a leader and a tough competitor in athletics, and won the friendship of many. When it came to serving, his  coach shared with me that Joey felt it was a call to go into the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I had the opportunity to visit with his mother Sondra Adkins. His family and friends remembered his warm smile, thoughtful nature and his ability to excel at everything he did. Joey Cantrell will be deeply missed by all who knew him. His mother shared that Joey believed in what he was doing and gave his life doing what he wanted to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we honor Joey's memory, our Nation grieves with his mother and his family. We are deeply indebted to Joey and thankful for his service. Soldiers like Joey Cantrell make me proud to be an American.</paragraph>
