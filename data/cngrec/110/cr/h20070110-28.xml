  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States is going to urge a troop escalation in Iraq. I must protest this for the following reasons:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This war was wrong from the beginning. Our focus should have been Afghanistan. We had a real opportunity to bring freedom and change to Afghanistan. Instead, we diverted our attention to Iraq with disastrous results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More troops will not bring the United States more support from the Iraqis, but it will bring our troops and the people of Iraq more misery, more fighting, more injuries and more death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are spending our children's future in this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no benefits to either the United States, to Iraq or to the world.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
