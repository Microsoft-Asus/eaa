    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3325">H.R. 3325</bill> which names a postal facility in Suffield, Connecticut, after CPL Stephen R. Bixler. <bill type="h" number="3325">H.R. 3325</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Joe Courtney on August 2, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Connecticut congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Marine CPL Stephen R. Bixler was killed on May 4, 2006, while conducting combat operations against enemy forces in al Anbar Province, Iraq. He was assigned to 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LTC James M. Bright, the battalion's commander, said, "Corporal Bixler was a vibrant, active man. He died fearlessly leading and willingly sacrificing his own safety for those around him."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Bixler was a devoted soldier with strength of character and self-assurance. He served his country with honor and distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, CPL Stephen Bixler was a proud and loyal American who served his country while fighting the war on terror. He made the ultimate sacrifice defending freedom when he lost his life on May 4, 2006. Corporal Bixler was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on August 17, 1985. As a student at Suffield High School, he was known as a "shy, soft-spoken, very dedicated young man and very patriotic, in a quiet, determined way." During high school, he was involved in athletics and was a member  of the indoor/outdoor track team as well as the cross country team. His love for the outdoors and helping others was exemplified during the time he was a Boy Scout and his hard work and dedication was shown when he became an Eagle Scout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In July 2003, Corporal Bixler's sense of dedication to his community and country led him to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He was an ambitious man who was able to accomplish much in his short, but meaningful, life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of his exceptional military skills, drive, courage and strength, Corporal Bixler applied for and was selected as a member of the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion. He volunteered willingly for his second tour in Iraq because he knew his fellow marines needed his help. Tragically, during his second tour, on May 4, 2006, he was killed by enemy fire in Fallujah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His decorations include the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Humanitarian Service Medal, Armed Forces Terrorism Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Purple Heart Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can never show adequate appreciation in honoring the brave men and women who give their lives in service to our country. However, Corporal Bixler's name is etched on the Wall of Honor in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the memorial wall, naming this post office in his honor is a fitting and meaningful tribute to a proud marine who served selflessly on behalf of his hometown and his Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to my friend from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Clay. I also want to thank Congressman Westmoreland for his kind words in support of <bill type="h" number="3325">H.R. 3325</bill>, which I'm the sponsor of, to name the post office at 235 Mountain Road in Suffield, Connecticut, after Corporal Stephen R. Bixler, who at the age of 20, on a second deployment in Iraq, lost his life serving our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the prior speakers have indicated, this young man was not with us long, but made an extraordinary mark on all who knew him and served with him, particularly in his home of Suffield, Connecticut, which is a small Connecticut town of 14,000 people. It was founded in 1749 before our Nation even was born, and his family on his mother's side goes back three generations. As you can imagine, in a tight-knit, small community, he was well-known despite being a quiet young man because of his work in  the community as an Eagle Scout. He was a varsity track athlete and an outstanding student.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had a twin sister, Sandra, who graduated with honors from the University of Connecticut; and, clearly, Stephen could have followed that same path. But he followed a road less traveled, and he enlisted for the Marines before he even graduated from Suffield High School and, as I indicated, was on his second tour of duty when he lost his life on May 4, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His funeral at Sacred Heart Church in Suffield, which was attended by Archbishop Mansell from the Hartford Archdiocese, was an extraordinary outpouring of support from his community. And all I can say is that event was not the end as far as the town was concerned. They have held many ceremonies in memory of Stephen. They named a stretch of road in Suffield in his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is fitting that the post office, which is the only Federal building in Suffield, should be named in his honor. His father has been a letter carrier for 35 years in the United States Post Office; but to be sure, our office solicited requests from the community to make sure that there was actual support in town. We had an outpouring of support: 170 letters came in, again, people who knew him as a young child all the way up through his time in the Marines, and I will submit letters from the  Governor on down in support of this measure at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STATE OF CONNECTICUT,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 20, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN COURTNEY: I am writing to encourage you to pursue legislation in the United States Congress that will change the name of the U.S. post office on Mountain Road in West Suffield, Connecticut to honor Marine Corporal Stephen R. Bixler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Corporal Bixler was killed in Fallujah, Iraq on May 3, 2006 while on foot patrol. Corporal Bixler was proud of his service to the nation, and believed that he was able to make a difference in the lives of the Iraqi citizens he encountered. In addition to  being a valiant member of our armed forces, Corporal Boxler was a Suffield native and an Eagle Scout. Renaming the post office in his honor would be an especially fitting tribute to Corporal  Bixler because it will be a lasting reminder of his selfless service to our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with State Representative Ruth Fahrbach, Suffield's Board of Selectmen and numerous residents of Suffield, in urging you to pursue this legislation to preserve the memory of one of our fallen heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very truly yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>M. JODI RELL,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STATE OF CONNECTICUT SENATE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STATE CAPITOL,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hartford, CT, July 26, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN COURTNEY: Thank you for contacting me in regards to naming the Suffield Post Office in honor of Corporal Stephen Bixler. Although such a gesture can never make up for the loss of such a brave young man, I believe that honoring his life in this way will be a source of comfort to his family and friends. Corporal Bixler, who selflessly gave his life for his country, fellow servicemembers, and all of us, deserves to be commemorated for his bravery and sacrifice. It is my hope  that you will introduce this legislation to Congress and that the Suffield Post Office will be dedicated to the life of Corporal Bixler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you again for asking my thoughts on this issue. It was my pleasure to write in support of this wonderful young man, his family, and his friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN A. KISSEL,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>STATE OF CONNECTICUT,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 11, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN COURTNEY: Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the request to name the Suffield Post Office for Corporal Stephen R. Bixler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Kevin Goff first contacted me about his suggestion to name the post office for Stephen, I thought it was an excellent idea. I suggested that he start by first contacting the Suffield Postmaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The death of Corporal Bixler brought together a community very divided on the war in Iraq. Residents lined the streets when his remains were transported from Bradley International Airport to the funeral home. Hundreds of friends, relatives and strangers attended his wake to show their love and support and to give thanks for his service and sacrifice to his country as well as to show support for grieving family members. As the funeral procession drove past the Suffield Post Office to the church,  Suffield postal employees lined the street outside. (Stephen's father is a postal employee.) McAlister Elementary School students and teachers just across the street lined the route as well. Sacred Heart Church was overflowing with mourners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of presenting Stephen with a citation when he received his Eagle Scout award. He was an inspiration and set a positive example to the younger boys in his troop. To Stephen, achieving the rank of Eagle Scout was not just about accumulating badges. It was about guiding younger scouts to achieve their goals assisting them in any way that he could and setting a positive example for those who were to follow. Not because he had to but because that was who he was. Stephen accomplished  much in his short life. Since I am not a resident of Suffield, I would defer to those who have decided to honor Corporal Bixler in this manner. I will say that in my opinion, naming the Suffield Post Office in honor of Corporal Stephen R. Bixler is appropriate, and well deserved and I am hopeful that Suffield residents agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ruth Fahrbach,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>TOWN OF SUFFIELD,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SELECTMEN'S OFFICE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 19, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN COURTNEY: The Suffield Board of Selectmen strongly supports any and all efforts to name the Suffield Post Office in honor of Corporal Stephen R. Bixler. The Board of Selectmen voted unanimously at their July 18, 2007 meeting to support this proposal. The naming of the Suffield Post Office in honor of Corporal Bixler is an appropriate tribute to a man who sacrificed his life for our Country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The loss of Corporal Bixler had a profound impact on the Town of Suffield and the residents of Suffield have made great efforts to recognize this hero. The Board of Selectmen, on behalf of the residents of Suffield, would like to thank you for your continued efforts to name the Suffield Post Office in honor of Corporal Bixler and will provide any further support you may need in this endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very truly yours,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE COURTNEY: I would like to lend my support to the suggestion that the Suffield Post Office located at 235 Mountain Road be named in honor of Corporal Stephen R. Bixler, United States Marine Corps. I believe that this would be a fitting tribute to a man who gave his life for his country. I am a member of the Suffield Board of Selectman, and I will ask our First Selectman to add an agenda item to our next meeting supporting this proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very truly yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Timothy J. Reynolds,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The excerpts of the letters, which Mr. Westmoreland was kind enough to share with the House, I think again describe an extraordinary person who every day as people drive by that post office and young children come in and ask their parents who that name is, it would be a fitting tribute and an inspiration of human excellence and courage, which all of us should try to aspire to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, I urge strong support for this measure which is a fitting tribute to an extraordinary young man.</paragraph>
