    <paragraph>Mr. President, since 2001, top officials in the Bush administration have secretly authorized the use of abusive interrogation techniques that in some cases have risen to the level of torture. In doing so, they have shown flagrant disregard for statutes, for treaties ratified by the United States, and for our own Constitution. They have misled the American people, undermined our values, and damaged our efforts to defeat al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some who downplay the abusive treatment of detainees that  has been uncovered at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere as isolated incidents, conducted by a handful of rogue low-level interrogators. But the facts indicate where the true responsibility lies: with an administration that gave the green light to torture and a Justice Department that said anything goes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, torture is against the law. The United States is a party to the Convention Against Torture, the Geneva Conventions, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United States Code criminalizes any act "specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering." And in 2005, Congress reiterated in the Detainee Treatment Act that cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment of detainees in U.S. custody is not permitted, no matter where those  detainees are held.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notwithstanding these obligations, top administration officials have continuously sought and found ways to disregard the legal and ethical boundaries on acceptable detainee treatment. On January 25, 2002, Alberto Gonzales, in his capacity as counsel to the President, signed a memo arguing that Taliban and al-Qaida detainees were not protected by the Third Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. He stated that "[i]n my judgment, this new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva's strict  limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions ....."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 2, 2002, the President issued an order determining that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees were entitled to neither prisoner of war protections under the Geneva Conventions nor the protections of Common Article Three. Gonzales also solicited from the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, the now infamous "Bybee memo," issued in August 2002, which in the context of the criminal prohibition on torture defined torture narrowly as the infliction of "intense pain or suffering of  the kind that is equivalent to the pain that would be associated with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant bodily function will likely result." The memo also contained the extreme--and dangerous--legal theory that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the OLC did not stop at general guidance. In a hearing this year before a House subcommittee, Steven Bradbury, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General at OLC, confirmed that his office had advised the CIA that the regulated use of waterboarding did not constitute torture for purposes of the criminal prohibition against torture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>High-level administration officials also have not hesitated to issue policies permitting abusive treatment of detainees. On November 27, 2002, Haynes sent a memo to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that asked him to approve 15 interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo Bay, including hooding, 20-hour interrogations, isolation, sensory deprivation, forced nudity, threatening detainees with dogs, and putting detainees in "stress positions" for up to four hours. Rumsfeld not only approved  the techniques, he added a hand-written note: "I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to 4 hours?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rumsfeld later rescinded the authorization of some of these techniques for use at Guantanamo, and reauthorized the use of others. But the consequences of these high-level approvals were far-reaching. A recent report by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General revealed that techniques authorized by Rumsfeld were used on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, both during the period they were authorized and after they had been rescinded. And such behavior was not limited to Guantanamo Bay.  According to the 2004 "Review of Department of Defense Detention Operations and Detainee Interrogation Techniques," known as the Church Report, the Combined Joint Task Force in Afghanistan also developed, authorized and implemented interrogation procedures similar to those Rumsfeld had approved in 2002. The Church Report and the "Final Report of the Independent Panel to Review DOD Detention Operations," known as the Schlesinger Report, also document</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While OLC was issuing memos effectively saying there were no legal restrictions on interrogations and high-level officials were authorizing abusive techniques, there is evidence to suggest that interrogators on the ground were given very little information about exactly what was and was not permitted. During a Judiciary Committee hearing on interrogation policy in June, I asked Department of Justice inspector general Glenn Fine whether he thought that military interrogators had clear guidance  on what techniques were permissible, given the administration's shifting policies. He responded that changes in policy "didn't always get down to the level of the interrogators" and that, at times, "they weren't sure or aware of what exactly was authorized." Likewise, the Schlesinger Report stated that "[t]he</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many individuals who were aware of what was happening raised concerns. Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote a January 2002 memo that weighed the costs and benefits of trying to evade the Geneva Conventions, noting that to do so would "reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine the protections of the rule of law for our troops." Others raised concerns as well. According to the DOJ inspector general's report on the involvement of the  FBI in military interrogations, several FBI agents "became deeply concerned not only about the efficacy of these techniques but also about their legality." In 2002, the FBI Director decided unequivocally that FBI agents would not participate in interrogations that used abusive techniques. In a November 7, 2002, memorandum for the Office of the Army General Counsel, Army COL John Ley stated that he believed that some of the techniques that the Pentagon was considering for use at Guantanamo Bay and that were later approved by Rumsfeld--could violate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, in 2006 after the Detainee Treatment Act became law, the Department of Defense finally agreed it would no longer authorize the use of harsh interrogation techniques by military personnel, and ordered that all personnel follow the interrogation policies laid out in the Army Field Manual. I have strongly supported proposals to require all intelligence agencies--specifically the CIA--to do the same. For far too long, this administration has failed to abide by the law and to protect  our values. The use of abusive interrogation techniques is unsupportable on moral, legal or national security grounds. It does not represent who we are as a nation, and it does not make America safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The responsibility for the use of immoral, illegal and counter-productive interrogation techniques does not stop with the interrogators who employed them. It extends to those in the highest echelons of the Bush administration that sought to encourage these  techniques, who confused interrogators with constantly shifting policies, and that ignored the many voices who told them that what they were doing was unlawful and that it was not the American way.  And it extends to the President himself, who has acknowledged publicly that in 2003 he approved meetings of his most senior national security officials to consider and sign off on so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. The abuses that have occurred under this administration's watch have constituted one of the darkest episodes in this Nation's</paragraph>
