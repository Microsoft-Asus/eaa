    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Private First Class Andrew Habsieger, who died serving our country in Iraq. On Easter Sunday, March 23, he was one of four soldiers killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad. He was scheduled to return home to his family in 2 weeks. Andy was just 22 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Festus, Missouri, friends and family remembered him as a loving child and standout high school football player. Andy proudly served the U.S. Army as an infantryman and was inspired to fight for his country after the terrible attacks of September 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 22, 2005, Andy wrote me requesting assistance in joining the Marine Corps because of experiencing migraines while growing up. Andy ultimately joined the Army. Looking back on his letter, I am reminded of his steely determination to serve his country. That he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The weekend Andy died marked the 4,000th American soldier killed in Iraq. My heart goes out to Andy's parents, Michael and Brenda Habsieger, as well as his brother, Jacob, who is also in the Army. We must never forget our Nation's fallen heroes. PFC Andrew Habsieger will not be forgotten and his service will inspire generations yet to come.</paragraph>
