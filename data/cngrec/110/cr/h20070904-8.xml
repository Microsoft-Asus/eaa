    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the district word period back in my State of Tennessee, I traveled, talked with many and listened to my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What they are wanting is people in Congress to solve problems. In their estimation, you are either part of the problem or part of the solution, and there is no in between. Yet they have not seen the liberal majority in this Congress tackle one of the most pressing problems of our time, that of illegal immigration, which is only getting worse every single minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this week I am introducing the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007. This legislation provides clear authority for local law enforcement to enforce immigration law, and actually requires the Feds to remove and deport criminal aliens detained by local law enforcement officials. What a novel concept, deportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also sends a tough message to sanctuary cities by reducing Federal funds to those cities that provide sanctuary to violent criminal aliens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act of 2007.</paragraph>
