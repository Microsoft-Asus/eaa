    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last Thursday evening, at Nationals Stadium, we had the 47th Annual Congressional Baseball Game. The true winners of the game were the Washington Literacy Council and the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of the Washington, D.C. area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of the score on the field, in the most thrilling game that I have been associated with in the last 21 years that I have played, coached or managed, in the bottom of the seventh with the bases loaded and one out and the Democrats leading 10-9, Connie Mack hit a dart back to the pitcher, Mr. Baca, who threw home for a force out making two outs. And then unfortunately for my friends on the Democratic side, the catcher overthrew the first baseman allowing two runs to score,  the winning run by the speedy Adam Putnam of Florida for a thrilling 11-10 victory. Our MVP on the Republican side was Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The class of 1996, which includes Kevin Brady, MVP; Kenny Hulshof, who was our first baseman, Chip Pickering; the third baseman; Jeff Flake, center fielder; Virgil Goode, right fielder; Tom Davis, one of our tricaptains; Pete Sessions, our third-base coach; and Sam Graves who was a pinch runner and hitter, those players in the 12 years that they have played in the game have an 11-1 record, which I think is amazing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi for attending the game, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer for attending the game, and I want to thank my good friend, Mike Doyle, for his excellent job of managing. It can truly be said that this year, the Democrats had victory in their grasp and took pity on us and allowed us to win one more time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as manager of the Democratic team, we want to congratulate our friends over on the Republican side in what had to be one of the most exciting games, certainly for the fans to watch, a little less exciting from our perspective. I just want to say our guys, the top of the seventh inning, we were down 8-4, and it was our last at-bat. And it would have been easy to fold. But our guys came back, scored six runs to put this game into the bottom of the seventh inning in one of  the most exciting games we've seen. I think parity has finally arrived in the House baseball game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to playing our friends across the aisle next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The big winner, of course, is our charities, the Washington Boys &amp; Girls  Clubs and the Washington Literacy Council. We have co-MVPs this year. Joe Baca pitched another outstanding performance for the Democrats. And one of our new Members, who caught an outstanding game and who had a hot bat for us, Chris Murphy, was our co-MVP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, if you have to lose to somebody, Joe Barton is the kind of guy you don't mind losing to. He is a great gentleman, a big fan of the game and one of my dear friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Joe. Congratulations to the Republicans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say, Mr. Speaker, that with our retirements, I am now open, assuming I am the manager, I would love to have some new blood. If there are some Democrats who didn't get playing time, if you want to switch parties, we are open for business. And to Tom Cole at the NRCC, please, please recruit us some new flat bellies.</paragraph>
