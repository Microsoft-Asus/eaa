  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the trade policies set in Washington and negotiated across the globe have a direct impact on places such as Toledo and Steubenville, on Cleveland and Hamilton. That is why voters in my State of Ohio and across the country sent a message loudly and clearly in November demanding a new direction, a very different direction for our Nation's trade policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Working men and women in Ohio know that job loss doesn't just affect the worker or just the worker's family; job loss--especially the kind of job loss we have seen in the last 5 years, the kind of manufacturing job loss--when we see that kind of job loss in the thousands, that job loss devastates communities. It hurts the local business owner, the drugstore, the grocery store, the neighborhood restaurant. It hurts communities. It hurts schools. It hurts police forces. It hurts fire departments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two weeks ago, leadership in the House of Representatives and in the White House announced a new outline for trade policy, one that included labor and environmental standards. The fact that the Bush administration was willing to negotiate at all, the fact that they were willing to pay even lip service to labor and environmental standards, underscores the November elections' importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every Member of Congress, in the Senate and in the other body, the House of Representatives, is now on notice that we will be held accountable for our trade votes--accountable to workers, accountable to business owners--accountable for our trade votes and accountable for American trade policy when we go home. However, since the announcement made by the Bush administration and some congressional leaders in the House about labor and environmental standards, backpedaling by the administration and  sidestepping by supporters of the deal indicate that we may be in for another round of more of the same in our trade policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration already has hinted at side deals for labor standards instead of putting those standards in the central, core part of the agreement. They are talking now about not reopening negotiations with Peru and not reopening negotiations with Panama but instead adding a little sidebar, a little letter, a little statement of support for environmental labor standards but not actually putting them in the central core of the agreement. If that is the case, if these labor and environmental  standards are not in the agreement but in a side letter of some sort, then really, frankly, nothing new is being offered. It is the same old jalopy with a new coat of paint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Voters in my State demanded real change, not symbolic gestures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is even more disturbing about the new outline is it appears to rely in good faith on the administration to enforce standards. Given this administration's abysmal record on enforcement of labor standards and environmental standards, not just in trade agreements but enforcement of those standards in our domestic economy, we know what this administration--we know its failed environmental policies. Given this administration's abysmal record on enforcement, relying on blind trust isn't just foolish,  it is downright irresponsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Jordan Free Trade Agreement passed by the House--I supported it and many others did; it passed in both Houses overwhelmingly--the Jordan Free Trade Agreement was once held up as a standard in labor provisions. It had strong labor and environmental standards in it. It passed in the year 2000, but come 2001, with a new President of the United States, George Bush, and a new U.S. Trade Representative, Bob Zoellick, the Bush administration simply turned the other way while rampant human-trafficking  plagues that nation of Jordan. Shortly after the Jordan agreement was enacted, the new USTR, Bob Zoellick, sent a letter to Jordan's Trade Minister saying the United States simply wouldn't enforce the labor provisions. So even though we passed a trade agreement with labor standards inside the core agreement, this administration, this same crowd</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as a result, Bangladeshi workers enter Jordan--from one of the poorest countries in the world--they have their passports confiscated, and work in some cases up to 20 hours a day without breaks. Then Jordan exports those goods to the United States. There is no enforcement of labor standards, no enforcement of environmental standards. There is simply the continuation of the exploitation of some of the poorest workers in the world in order to reap more profits and backdoor those products  into the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If that is the plan, if that is the Bush administration plan--forget what they talk about on labor standards, forget what they promise on environmental standards--if that is the plan for Peru, if that is the plan for Panama, if that is the plan for Colombia, if that is the plan for South Korea, then they will simply not get the support for these trade agreements. They will not get the support from those who talked about fair trade in their campaigns, not from small business owners, not from small  manufacturers such as the local tool and die shop in Akron, the local machine shop in Dayton, not from workers across the country who say: We don't want more of the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what the elections last fall were all about. I believe every single new Democratic Member of the Senate--there are nine of us--every single one of us has talked about fair trade, not free trade. If this administration thinks by simply saying: We are for labor standards, we are for environmental standards, we will put it in a little side letter here, and then a wink and a nod to their friends in the National Association of Manufacturers, a wink and a nod to the large corporations that  benefit from slave labor and child labor, simply giving them a wink and a nod, if they think this Senate and the other body are going to pass this kind of legislation, they are wrong. We know our trade policies have failed. As I said, if they bring back this kind</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know our trade policies have failed. When I first ran for Congress, our trade deficit in 1992 was $38 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in those days, President Bush--the first President Bush--said a $1 billion trade deficit represented about 13,000 jobs, mostly manufacturing--many manufacturing jobs. So if you had a $1 billion trade deficit, it meant it was costing your country a net loss of 13,000 jobs. If you had a trade surplus, it was a gain of 13,000 jobs. That was then a $38 billion trade deficit in 1992. In 2006, our trade deficit was in the vicinity of $800 billion--$800 billion. That means the trade deficit has  grown by a factor of 20. If it is 13,000 jobs for every $1 billion trade deficit, you do the math. It is clear this trade policy has failed. It has failed our workers. It has failed our small manufacturers. It has failed our restaurants and our drugstores in those communities that suffer devastating job loss. It has failed our families. It has failed our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current system is not sustainable. Senator Dorgan has said: We want trade, and plenty of it, but under new rules. That means benchmarks. When we pass trade agreements, we have to show how much this has done for America's wages, how much it has done for American job creation, and we want accountability, something we have never brought to the table on these trade agreements. That does not mean trying to pass off more of the same kind of trade policy, packaging it in a different way,  speaking of all the platitudes of the administration and that some others in the House and Senate have spoken about, just simply saying it is new and improved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is not the time for more bad trade deals. We need to pause. We need to have a national conversation about a new direction for trade in the 21st century, a conversation that includes everybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
