  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - December 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15598">S15598</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, we are going to then move and complete work today on the farm bill. We hope the two managers can work through whatever minor problems exist. The sooner people determine what they want to do, the more quickly we can dispose of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated earlier, we are going to file cloture this evening, this afternoon, on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It is an extremely important piece of legislation. There are some strong feelings on both sides of the issue. We are going to come in around 11 o'clock on Monday morning. There will be a vote around noon on Monday. The managers of this bill, this important bill, should be ready to start legislating Monday afternoon. We do not have a lot of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important piece of legislation. There are a significant number of amendments people want to offer. A week from Tuesday is Christmas. So I would hope we can work our way through this. We hope there are some other issues we can complete. Late in the session like this, they have to be agreed upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator McConnell and I have had a number of conversations the last couple of days on the way we are going to end the session regarding funding, other issues relating to funding. The one good thing is both my office and his office have kept quiet about it. As a result of that, things are moving fairly quietly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the way we want it. No one will be surprised about anything. Everyone will know exactly what is going to happen. At this stage, it appears the House will take up the spending matter, the omnibus, on Monday. They will send it to us on Tuesday. That is the glidepath we have now. The path we hope is a smooth one, but in this world we live in, you never know, but it is looking pretty good.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, let me briefly add, I am hoping there will not be a need for this hour of debate on the Defense conference report. I think we all know what is in it at this point. Hopefully, we can yield back time. There are a number of Members who have travel plans. If we can expedite the consideration of the remaining issues, it would be appreciated by a great many of our Members.</paragraph>
