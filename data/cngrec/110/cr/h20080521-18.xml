  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the phones in my office have been ringing off the hook. Constituents are hopping mad about the skyrocketing price of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Dallas in just the last month, the price for a gallon of gas has jumped 30 cents. And that's in Texas, where we drill and explore on land and along the coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's about time for the Congress to take action. In fact, it's past time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two-thirds of the oil we use comes from foreign countries. We have oil and gas in the United States, but we have to be willing to move forward with exploration. Congress should allow exploration in Alaska, along the eastern seaboard, the west coast, and allow more refineries to be built.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer to rising gas prices is right here in America. We have the technology. We have the resources. The time is now. Democrats in Congress need to step aside and let the ingenuity of Americans solve this problem today.</paragraph>
