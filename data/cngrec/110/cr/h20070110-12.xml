    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Wake Forest University's Institute for Regenerative Medicine for its recent medical breakthrough in amniotic fluid stem cell research. Using these specific cells does not require the destruction of human life at any stage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is tremendous news. Not only does this prevent the destruction of human life but these stem cells have amazing properties that show very promising results. Unlike embryonic stem cells, these remain stable for years without forming tumors and are easily retrieved for medical use. They also have the ability to grow into brain, muscle and other forms of tissue that could potentially cure diseases. In addition, since these cells are a genetic match to a fetus, they can be used to help cure birth  defects or even be frozen over time to use as a personalized tissue bank for use later in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being a medical breakthrough, this gives hope to millions who support the sanctity of life that curing diseases and the potential for regenerative tissue growth are possible in a moral and ethical way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to recognize the truly amazing work of Wake Forest University's Institute of Regenerative Medicine and look forward to the promise of its continued research.</paragraph>
