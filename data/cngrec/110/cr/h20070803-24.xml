  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's obvious we have a technical problem. I know that comes as a great shock and surprise to you. I've talked to the gentleman who's in charge of fixing mechanical problems. He tells me that we need to take the system down for a period of time in order to fix it. He has said he needs approximately 30 minutes to do that with no votes. We are in the process of a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the Speaker pro tempore has said, I don't know what the vote is. I don't know whether it's coming up on the computers. I do know in my office there was no time coming up on the computer. So Members do not know how much time they have left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. HOYER (during the vote). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that we vacate this vote, and as soon as the machine is fixed, that we return to cast this vote and then proceed with the proceedings.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to object simply to inquire of the distinguished majority leader, does he intend to recess the House for this 30-minute time? I wonder if he might enlighten us as to what the plan would be. I'm happy to yield to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>For all of us who think that dastardly things are going on, I guess we're all trying to figure out who's doing the dastardly things. In any event, in answer to your question, it would be my intention to rise while the machines are being fixed because we cannot proceed, nor should we proceed, without having Members know how much time they have left to vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want you to be very nice to that gentleman. He represents my daughter and my son-in-law. So be careful and very gentle with him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Further reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to inquire further of the majority leader. We're in a very awkward situation here. We don't know what the vote total is at this juncture. The House may have just voted to adjourn so far as we know. So the gentleman has just come to the conclusion that he's going to propose that we recess, or he said rise. We're already in the House. We're not in the Committee of the Whole. I'd be happy to yield to my friend if he would like  to respond.</paragraph>

We don't know what the outcome of the vote that is being considered at this moment is. Many of us don't know how our colleagues are recorded, and I will tell you this is a very, very difficult  time for this institution.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I prepare to yield to the majority leader, I would like to inquire, is the vote still open? If Members want to change their votes now, they can continue to do that? If a Member were to walk into the Chamber now, they could still vote?</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry, in response to the question from the distinguished majority leader, I will say that we have no way of verifying what it is that is coming out of this computer here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not operating the way it normally does. If Members are able to still vote, we can see this screen here, but it is not operating. I don't normally operate this thing, but our crack team here has told me that it is not operating the way that it normally does.</paragraph>

  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>Under those circumstances, under those circumstances, the reason I made the offer to vacate, the request for the unanimous consent to vacate, is because you can't verify it, and I have a list here in front of me. It may or may not be accurate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The machines are obviously not functioning as we would want them to do, so my suggestion is the way to fix that is to vacate the vote. The machines have to be taken down.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>I yield to my friend from Dallas.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in response to the majority leader, I would go to the rules of the House. I would quote them on page 32 of the rules of the House: When the electronic voting system is inoperable, or is not used, and I believe it is at this time inoperable and has been for the past 40 minutes or so, the Speaker or the chairman may direct the Clerk to conduct a record vote or quorum call as provided in clause 3 or 4.</paragraph>

  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman read the rule correctly. It said "may." The simpler way to do it and the confidence-building way to do that seems to me, because we want to use these machines, is to allow the technicians the opportunity to fix the machines. That is our desire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we understand that if you don't want to proceed with the business of the House, either the DOD appropriation bill, the FISA bill or the bill trying to give emergency relief to those in Minneapolis, the bridge, we may not want to proceed.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if I could reclaim my time under my reservation, reserving the right to object, I do want to say that we are very committed to ensuring that we get the resources necessary to those who have been victimized in Minnesota. That's a very high priority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, if the gentleman will yield, we need to calm down. We have a heavy responsibility. We have great differences. I understand that everybody's sensibilities are taut. I predicted that last Tuesday, that that would be the case. I regret it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret what happened last night which has generated this. But we do have business to do. All I am saying is I don't want to have a question about this vote, because we cannot assure ourselves, as the gentleman said, that the list I have in front of me or the screen that you have projected to you is projecting the accurate information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I suggest, given that, that we give the technicians an opportunity to facilitate fixing it. I think that's a reasonable request.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to make sure the majority leader understands that, for the last months, this majority that is on this side of the aisle has routinely asked and spoken with the majority about the way we would like to see things happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regularly, we are told that it will be done the way you choose to do it. You are attempting now to make a decision about what you would like to do.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>In either event, whether we shut the machine down now and allow them time to fix this by rising or going to the suggestion of the gentleman from Texas as to the rules, in either event you have to vacate this vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, the Speaker can call this vote. I presume, I don't know, because I haven't asked, that the result I have in front of me is the same the Speaker has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no problem with doing that vote, frankly. But I think it would raise in the minds of every Member here, is that the accurate count? I think in light of that, I would prefer not to do that. So I am trying to accommodate the confidence of the Members by vacating this vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>If I could reclaim my time under my reservation, I would simply ask the majority leader, since we have been talking about DOD, FISA, the tragedy in Minnesota and a wide range of things since the gentleman propounded his unanimous consent request, I wonder if he might repeat it again so that Members might hear what that request consists of.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>In consultation with the technical people that we have, who are responsible for ensuring the proper operations of our computer system, which advises all of us on time and computes the votes, that they have to take the system down for approximately a half an hour, maybe slightly longer, for the purpose of fixing the machine. I think the machine needs to be fixed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in order to accommodate that objective, I am suggesting that we vacate this vote, allow them to do that, come back and then revote this particular vote and then move on to wherever we are going to move on.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, continuing to reserve the right to object, I would ask my friend if, in fact, if, in fact, we were to proceed with vacating this vote, taking this 30-minute period of time, if we reconvene after that, may I ask the distinguished majority leader, in what order and what is it that we will be considering? Will we be considering the FISA issue, or will we be considering the issue that we are all very committed to, and that is ensuring that the bridge in the Twin Cities is  addressed?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see Mrs. Bachmann here. I know there are other Members of the delegation who want to do that. I just would like to inquire of the majority leader how we would proceed.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>I will tell my friend, my first order of business, as I propounded in my unanimous consent request, will be this vote. This is the matter of business before the House, the motion to adjourn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot resolve it with, I think, the full confidence of the Members. So that would be the first order of the business. We will then proceed with the business as we had been doing.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Chair would remind the gentleman from California that there is still debate to be continued on the rule.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>Yes, I am aware of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing to reserve the right to object, I would like to ask the majority leader, assuming we do reconvene and assuming that the House does not adjourn, what does he anticipate the schedule would be? Are we going to address the priority of assuring that the  resources get to the State of Minnesota? Or are we going to move directly to the FISA issue? In what order will we be considering these issues, Mr. Leader?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>We are going to consider both of those matters.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>May I ask in what order we would be addressing those?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOYER" of="">
    <paragraph>The order we will consider those is we will consider Minnesota first. We believe that is the least contentious of the items, and we think, therefore, it would be good to get the least contentious item out of the way first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody in this body has great empathy for the State of Minnesota, but, more particularly, the people who lost their lives in that tragic collapse of the bridge. We will go to that first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, we have the rules to complete, but we will then, in terms of business, go to FISA, as we have expressed.</paragraph>

There is a number on the computer on the minority side, and there is a number on the computer on the majority side. Why don't we compare numbers? If they are the same, accept the vote. We know that we are going to get beat. Let's accept this vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would recommend that our distinguished minority leader show our number to the majority leader's number, and if they are the same, accept it as this vote. That's my suggestion. I think we could at least expedite this one vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my distinguished minority leader (Mr. Boehner).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a motion that has been made by the majority leader to vacate the vote. I think we should proceed with a unanimous consent and recess to fix the machine and come back and vote when the machine is ready for us to vote.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, the vote is vacated.</chair>
