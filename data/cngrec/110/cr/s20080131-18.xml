  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me share with my colleagues my experiences of traveling through the State of Maryland during these last few weeks. I had the chance to be on the Eastern Shore of Maryland this week. I have been to western Maryland. I have been to the urban centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you, there are families in my State that are hurting. They are uncertain about their future. They are not only worried about whether they should buy an automobile or go out to eat dinner, they are concerned about their economic security. They are not sure what tomorrow will bring. They see a shrinking of the middle class. They do not know how bright their economic future will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have seen seniors who are concerned about their financial stability. They hear all this talk about trying to cut back on Social Security and Medicare, and they are worried about where they will be as far as being able to pay their bills. They need to know we are confident about America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must tell you, I think what the Federal Reserve did in reducing the prime rate was the right thing to do. It will have an immediate impact as far as reducing the prime interest rate, but it also instills confidence in our economy and in our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the Congress has a similar responsibility. It is important we pass a short-term economic stimulus package as quickly as possible. But that package needs to be targeted. By "targeted," I mean it needs to put money in the hands of people who will spend that money, who will be able to help our economy, and it must be fair. It must be fair to those who are really at risk because of the economic conditions our Nation is confronting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the bill that passed in the other body was a good start. It was a bill that would provide money to basically middle-income families. I think that money is likely to get back into our economy. Just as importantly, it was a signal of confidence in our economy and confidence in America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is our responsibility to try to improve that package. I thank the leadership of the Senate Finance Committee and my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee for bringing out a package that I believe improves the bill that came over from the other body. It improves it in several ways. Let me just talk about three of the provisions because I think they are very important to a short-term economic stimulus package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Senate Finance Committee's recommendations would include low-income seniors. Now, low-income seniors are really concerned about their future. But just as  importantly, it is not only the fair thing to do, the right thing to do, it is going to help our economy because low-income seniors, if you give them that check, are going to go out and buy something. That is going to help us. It is going to help the grocery stores. It is going to help the retail establishments. It is going to help the restaurants. It is going to generate economic activity. So it is in our interest to accomplish the objectives of an economic stimulus package to include low-income  seniors. I am very proud the Finance Committee included that in their package they are recommending to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing they put in their package, which I think is very important, is the extension of unemployment insurance benefits. All States would get an extra 13 weeks and, for those high-unemployment States, 26 weeks. Now, again, this is a matter of fairness. The people who are directly impacted by the downturn in our economy are those who are on unemployment, who do not have jobs, who have lost their jobs. We are finding that the unemployment rates are getting higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from a State that does not have a high unemployment rate. We have a rather diverse economic structure in Maryland, so we are not quite hit as hard as the rest of the country as far as employment numbers are concerned. But I am proud to support the provision and encourage my colleagues to support that provision which provides the extra benefits for those States that have been hit the hardest because they have people who are going to have a much more difficult time finding new employment.  So it is a fair thing to do. It is the right thing to do during an economic downturn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it also is going to help our economy. If you give money to people who are unemployed, those individuals are going to spend that money. They are  going to spend it on basic necessities. That is going to help economic growth. It is going to help everyone in this country. So it is targeted, and it is fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third provision that I really appreciate being in the Senate Finance bill is one to help the housing market. We have a housing crisis. In all parts of Maryland, we have homeowners, some of whom are in foreclosure and many others who are at risk of losing their homes. But we have young families that are trying to buy a home, we have people trying to sell a home, and they can't. There is a credit crunch out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Finance bill will at least start us on the way of trying to help the trigger for our current economic problems. I say "the trigger" because there were signs we were going to have a slowdown in our economy, but it was triggered by the mortgage crisis. In that regard, the Senate Finance bill does something about that. It is targeted to the problem we have in our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank the members of the Senate Finance Committee, the leadership, the bipartisan leadership of that committee for improving that package. It is a modest change from the House package in dollars, but it is huge as far as the impact it will have on the people in our communities in trying to deal with the current economic problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Leader Reid for being prepared to bring up this issue now. We cannot delay it. It is timely. It is important. We have to get this bill done. I appreciate our leader bringing this bill to the floor as quickly as we possibly can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have urged my friends on the other side of the aisle to please work with us. We might have some differences. Let's work out those differences. But do not use the delaying tactics of this body so we cannot vote on a stimulus package as soon as possible. We would like to do it today. If we cannot do it today, let's do it Monday. But let's get it done because the effectiveness of an economic stimulus package depends upon it getting out as quickly as possible. Part of it is a message to the people  of this country. I think if we put aside our partisan differences and get it done, it will be an incredible message to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also point out that once we have gotten that done, once we are able to work out this short-term stimulus package, I hope we can use the same spirit of cooperation for the long-term economic challenges we have in this Nation. We have long-term economic challenges to deal with if we are going to be as competitive as we need to be and if we are going to see the kind of economic growth we should have and see the growth of the middle class and middle-class families being able to enjoy the fruits  of our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to deal with the frustrations of typical families in Maryland and around the Nation that are worried about energy costs. They are worried about the cost of gasoline and filling up the tanks of their cars. They are worried about health care costs and the rising health care costs in our communities. They are concerned about the housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can use the same degree of bipartisan cooperation and focus, as we, hopefully, will have on the short-term economic package, on our long-term economic problems. Let's get energy independence in America. Let's bring down the cost of energy. Let's make it predictable. Let's not be dependent upon the whim of other countries. Let's develop alternative fuels. Let's do the conservation we need. Let's make energy more reliable and affordable and, by the way, more environmentally friendly. Let's bring  down health care costs. Let's deal with the number of people who are uninsured--which is terribly expensive to all of us--who use our health care system in a more costly way, many times through the emergency room. Let's work together to bring down the cost of health care so it is more affordable and accessible to every family in our communities. Let's deal with the credit</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased we are on the verge of passing the short-term economic stimulus package. I urge my colleagues to make sure this is brought up quickly. I hope we are able to take up the provisions that are included in the Finance Committee package, and perhaps some additional improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
