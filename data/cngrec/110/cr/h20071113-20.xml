  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="335">H. Res. 335</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer deaths;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas lung cancer kills more people annually than breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer combined;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, since the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and comprehensive research has raised the 5-year survival rates for breast cancer to 88 percent, for prostate cancer to 99 percent, and for colon cancer to 64 percent;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is still only 15 percent and a similar coordinated and comprehensive research effort is required to achieve increases in lung cancer survivability rates;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 60 percent of lung cancer cases are now diagnosed in nonsmokers or former smokers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas  2/3  of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are women;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas certain minority populations, such as Black males, have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality, notwithstanding their lower smoking rate;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas members of the baby boomer generation are entering their sixties, the most common age at which people develop cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and battlefield emissions are serious problems among military personnel and war veterans;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer research was "far below the levels characterized for other common malignancies and far out of proportion to its massive health impact";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group identified as its "highest priority" the creation of integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather than around specific research disciplines; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States must enhance its response to the issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes lung cancer as a public health priority and the importance of taking steps toward reducing the lung cancer mortality rate by at least half by 2015;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) acknowledges the importance of the recommendations of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) encourages increased investment for lung cancer research and other lung cancer-related programs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) supports efforts to develop a broad-based lung cancer screening and disease management program among members of the Armed Forces and veterans; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) recognizes the benefit of graduate medical education programs in thoracic medicine and cardiothoracic surgery.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="335">H. Res. 335</bill>, and I would like to thank the lead cosponsors of the resolution, Ed Whitfield and Donna Christensen. I also wish to strongly commend the Lung Cancer Alliance and other organizations that have supported this resolution. I am so pleased  we could pass this resolution during Lung Cancer Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 335 calls on the President to declare lung cancer a public health priority and encourages a greater investment in lung cancer research. This could not come at a more important time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have just seen newly released statistics that show, while overall cancer mortality rates are dropping quicker than ever, lung cancer mortality rates in women are actually increasing. As our Nation is committed to working towards the goal of eliminating all cancer deaths by 2015, the statistics for lung cancer are extremely disappointing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of both men and women, yet we are perhaps making the least amount of progress in effectively treating it. We must put greater investment into prevention and early diagnosis of lung cancer. This is the only way to improve outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most effective ways to reduce lung cancer incidence is, of course, smoking cessation. I am proud of the remarkable achievements our Nation has made to encourage smokers to quit, and better yet, to teach people never to begin at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Disappointingly, some of America's leading women's magazines don't share that goal. As many of you have heard and seen, they continue running ads for cigarettes like Camel No. 9 which are clearly targeted at young women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After years of steady decline, smoking rates have remained stagnant from 2004 to 2006. Launching an aggressive marketing campaign targeting young people is a terrible step backwards in our national efforts to reduce smoking. I hope this resolution today will reinforce our commitment to smoking cessation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one of the lesser known facts of lung cancer is that 8 percent of men and an astonishing 20 percent of women with lung cancer have never smoked. I am very aware of this fact through my own personal experience as my daughter became one of these statistics. I think the Nation as a whole became more aware with more visible cases, such as Dana Reeve. It often takes a high-profile case to propel us into action, and I hope that the growing awareness and action over the past 2 years will continue  to improve our understanding of and our ability to confront lung cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With a greater investment into integrated, multidisciplinary research organized around lung cancer, we do have a chance of reducing death. Let us use the opportunity of passing this resolution to reaffirm our shared commitment to combating lung cancer deaths, truly making it a public health priority for our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="335">H. Res. 335</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mrs. Capps. And I also want to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton, and others who have had a real hand in moving this legislation before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of this resolution, a resolution recognizing the impact of lung cancer and the recent recommendations of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute. This group's process is a comprehensive, collaborative, integrated approach to control and eliminate lung cancer. The group was tasked with making recommendations, strategizing, and reporting on progress made in an effort to control and eliminate lung cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The group was able to identify scientific priorities and needs and set forth a national agenda for research on lung cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Progress Review Group made the recommendation to foster the creation of scientifically integrated multi-institutional research consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather than around specific research disciplines. The recommendation speaks to the ongoing work at the NIH as well as in the private sector for cross-cutting research. And as a Congress, it is our responsibility to endow these researchers to best pursue answers. This report clarifies the benefits of broad science.  Putting disease research into silos so that, as so many authorizing bills often do, is not always helpful to the greater goal. Let's take these recommendations to pursue a multilevel, multidisciplinary science in an effort to find a cure for lung cancer or</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many of us here have been with someone at a bedside that is suffering from this awful disease, one of the worst. It is a great step forward that we can pass this legislation, to see the research come about, the funding with it, so that some day in fact we will have a cure to prevent this tragedy in families across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>In closing, I just want to urge our colleagues to pass this resolution and to press forward with the research on lung cancer. I do this in the name of my daughter and of Dana Reeve and other people whose lives have not been saved but who could be promoting others to be encouraged to eradicate this most deadly of cancer scourges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
