    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="511">H.R. 511</bill> introduced by Mr. Sam Johnson of Texas, which says that we ought to pledge the faithful support of Congress to members of the United States Armed Forces serving in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there are a lot of things we can disagree on on this floor of the House, but cutting funding for our troops ought not be one of them. As many others have done, I have also visited Walter Reed and talked to the brave men and women who have served there, not just from my district, from my State and around the Nation. And when I ask them, is there anything that we can do for you, the vast majority of them say, Congressman, just let me get back to my unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, that sense of duty, that sense of honor, that sense of commitment and that sense of patriotism is something we in Congress would do well to emulate. This resolution says that members of the United States Armed Forces have served honorably in their mission to fight terrorism and protect the greater security of the United States, that these members of the Armed Forces and their families have made many sacrifices. This resolution, Madam Speaker, deserves our support.</paragraph>
