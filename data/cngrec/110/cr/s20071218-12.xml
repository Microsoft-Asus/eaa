    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to note with some sadness that we are reaching a point at the end of this session where it appears we will adjourn without acting on any of the nominees for the Federal Election Commission. The effect of this will be to leave the Federal Election Commission with only two functioning commissioners, when the law calls for six. It is worse than that. The law insists that no action can be taken by the commission without the votes of at least four. So by having only  two left, we will leave  the Federal Election Commission with no capacity to function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a history with the Federal Election Commission which makes me sensitive to the importance of this group. When I was elected, there was an allegation made against me which I considered highly partisan. It went before the FEC and before the entire commission a vote was taken, with the three Republicans upholding the position I took and the three Democrats holding the position on the other side. Because they could not muster four votes, nothing was done. In my view, this was justice. But  the thing I found difficult was the fact that the partisanship on the FEC was so heavy, there was an almost automatic 3-3 vote on everything. It makes far more sense for the commissioners to work together to recognize the merits of the case, rather than simply responding in a knee-jerk partisan fashion to the individual or group that is bringing the charge. In my case, that is what</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It got to the point here on the floor where a piece of legislation was introduced saying, whenever there is a tie in the FEC, the general counsel will break the tie. Along with Senator McConnell, I and others did our best to defeat that bill because it would have de facto made the general counsel of the FEC the sole decisionmaker for that body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to report that those days seem to have passed. We now have an FEC where the vast majority of the votes are unanimous, where partisanship seems to have taken a back seat to an attempt to get things right and act on the merits rather than the partisan challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four of the members of the FEC are recess appointees who must be confirmed. The President has sent forward four names--two Republicans and two Democrats. In the standard tradition, practice, procedure, and precedent of the FEC, the Democratic leadership in the Congress got to pick the two Democrats. The Republican leadership got to pick the two Republicans. Always before we have moved these nominations forward en bloc, maintaining the balance between Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans  approving the Democratic nominations, and Democrats approving the Republican nominations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our committee, the Rules Committee on which I have the honor to sit, we sent all four of the names en bloc to the Senate. There was great controversy about one of them, which I will address, but in the spirit of the past history of the committee, instead of singling out this one individual to come to the Senate without recommendation, we said we will treat all four of them alike, and all four names came to the Senate without recommendation so that the Senate could work its will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now because of the controversy surrounding one of the Republican nominees, it becomes clear we will not have a vote on any of the four, producing the deadlock I described at the opening of my remarks. We will have only two functioning FEC commissioners beginning next year, and the FEC will not be able to rule on any of the controversies that may arise in  the 2008 election. Furthermore, the FEC will not be able to distribute any Presidential matching funds in the 2008 election. This comes as bad news to some of our colleagues in the Senate, because many of them were dependent upon and expecting the matching funds to come out of the Presidential campaign fund. They will not get them, because these nominees will not be approved. Who is the one who is causing all of this problem? His name is Hans von Spakovsky. He has been attacked by outside groups  on the grounds that he is somehow insensitive to minority voters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to spend a moment examining that particular attack. It all comes back to a position Mr. von Spakovsky took when he was at the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and recommended the pre-clearance of a voter ID law. There were those who were career attorneys in the Civil Rights Division who said a voter ID law is terrible and should not go forward. But Mr. von Spakovsky disagreed with them. Then, acting on Mr. von Spakovsky's recommendation, the management of the Justice Department  said: No, we are going to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to those who have attacked Mr. von Spakovsky, he was overruled by a court. The court did issue an injunction, saying that the voter ID law could not be enforced, thus leaving the impression that von Spakovsky is an ideologue, while the career attorneys were simply doing their job and the court stepped in to protect the country from this ideologue. In fact, the injunction had to do simply with the timing of the implementation of the law and was not a determination on the merits of the  case, with the court saying it didn't want the law enforced right now but wanted to wait until the matter could be fully considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the case was heard, a Federal judge, one appointed by President Carter, although that probably shouldn't make any difference, and the one who had initially issued the injunction, upheld the constitutionality of the Georgia voter ID law and, in that fashion, ratified the position Mr. von Spakovsky had taken all along. Mr. von Spakovsky's position was consistent with the ruling of the Federal court that said the career attorneys who argued with him were wrong. He was on the right side of  the law; they were on the wrong side of the law. Yet he is being attacked as somehow being the ideologue who must be kept off the FEC lest the FEC be turned into some kind of partisan hotbed of difficulty and dissension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, Mr. von Spakovsky has served on the FEC as a recess appointee for 2 years. We need not project what he would do if he were confirmed. We can look at what he has done in that 2-year period. To that point, I repeat that the vast majority of the cases that have been dealt with since he has been on the FEC have been unanimous. He has not been a lone voice seeking to destroy the FEC or turn it into some kind of partisan hotbed. He has acted completely in the mainstream, in the opinion  of the other members of the FEC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quote from one of the Democratic members of the FEC, repeating again these people are appointed for their partisan positions. This is not a circuit court where you want to find someone who is above partisanship. This is where the law specifically says there will be three Republicans and three Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what Mr. Walther, a Democratic member of the FEC, had to say at the December 14 FEC meeting. This is from a very recent article. He said Mr. von Spakovsky was "a terrific person to work with" as a colleague, a "fine commissioner." The article continues: "He (Walther) spoke after Mr. von Spakovsky made a traditional nominating speech, praising Mr. Walther's qualifications to be vice chairman. Mr. Walther's comments echoed a speech during the FEC meeting by Mr. Lenhard to close his  year-long chairmanship by praising bipartisan cooperation on the commission and recounting the FEC's accomplishments in resolving enforcement cases."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things we hear around here during confirmation battles is, the President ought to make more mainstream nominations. Not for this one; this one, by law, is supposed to be partisan. But here is a man who has had 2 years of experience, 2 years of service, being praised for his activities, clearly in the mainstream, being attacked for a position he held before he came to the FEC where polls have been done and found that 81 percent of Americans, with only 7 percent dissenting, agree with  Mr. von Spakovsky's position that we ought to have voter ID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have photo ID requirements in order to keep cigarettes out of the hands of teenagers. We have photo ID requirements in order to keep terrorists off airplanes. I have had the experience in my home State of Utah, where I like to think I am fairly well known, of being asked for a photo ID when I have presented a credit card, in an effort to avoid identity theft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isn't preventing voter fraud as important as keeping tobacco out of the  hands of teenagers or preventing identity theft? Eighty-one percent of Americans agree with von Spakovsky's position on this matter. Yet he is being attacked as being outside the mainstream for what his critics call a partisan position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the holds that have been placed on Commissioner von Spakovsky's nomination, we now come to this impasse where the FEC will be left with only two Commissioners, unable to rule on any potential violation that may occur in the 2008 election--a Presidential year, along with all of the Senate races that are up, and every Member of the House of Representatives. The FEC will not be able to rule on any violations because they will have only two Commissioners--all because of an ideological  bent pushed by groups outside of the Congress saying that this one man, because he agrees with 81 percent of the American people, is somehow disqualified for being too partisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The principle has always been that the Republicans pick the Republican nominees for the FEC and the Democrats pick the Democratic nominees for the FEC--a principle that makes sense. I do not know very much about the Democratic nominees for these positions who will not be confirmed, and, frankly, I do not care because they are not mine to select. They have been picked by the Democratic leadership to represent the Democratic position, and I am willing to vote for them on that basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. von Spakovsky has a 2-year history of acting intelligently, with great integrity, and great collegiality in this position, and it is a tragedy that the whole Commission will be denied the opportunity to function in a Presidential year; that those Presidential candidates who are depending on Presidential matching funds will not get them because outside groups have demonized this one public servant. It is a sad day that this kind of thing is happening with respect to our governmental appointments.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I certainly do not want to preempt him if he wants to go next. Does the Senator have a preference? If not, I will go ahead, if that is OK.</paragraph>
