  <speaking speaker="400285" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, an estimated 2 million seniors suffer from a depressive illness, and another 5 million may have depressive symptoms. The risk for depression doubles when a person has a chronic illness such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer or Parkinson's disease. People with mental illness can get better with the right treatment, but Medicare's current policy discriminates against mental health by charging 2 1/2   times  more in copayments than for any other outpatient health care treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seniors who receive necessary mental health services reduce their hospital costs. One hospital offered mental health services for elderly patients with fractures, and reduced the length of stay by 2 days and hospital costs by over $160,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be reintroducing legislation to end Medicare discrimination for mental health services by adjusting copayments, and I ask my colleagues to cosponsor it. Learn more about how we can make health care affordable and accessible by visiting my Web site, Murphy.house.gov. We need patient-centered health care for patient quality, patient safety and patient choice.</paragraph>
