    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to William E. Colson, a great Oregonian, who devoted his entire life to building and operating quality senior housing. Beginning in 1971 in Salem, OR, Bill Colson and his father Hugh built and operated independent living communities for seniors. The company they founded, Holiday Retirement Corp., earned a reputation for providing middle-income seniors access to outstanding housing and services. By steadily constructing and selectively acquiring  senior housing properties, Holiday Retirement Corp. grew to become the largest owner and manager of senior housing in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Colson and his partners, including his wife Bonnie, son Bart, and Dan Baty, Norm Brendan, Patrick Kennedy, Thilo Best, Mark Burnham, the Hasso family, Bruce Thorn, and their loyal employees and investors collectively built and managed over 80,000 senior living units in the United States, Canada, France and United Kingdom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Colson has been recognized as a founding father of seniors housing by the American Seniors Housing Association, an organization he helped create in 1991. With his passing at age 66, Bill Colson leaves his wife, two sons, Brad and Bart, and three grandchildren, all of whom he adored. He was beloved by his family and by the thousands of employees and residents he served so well over the years. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Bill Colson and celebrating his lifetime of achievements  building and operating outstanding housing for seniors across North America and Europe. He will be remembered by those whose lives he touched as a devoted family man, successful businessman, generous philanthropist, genuine friend and a great American.</paragraph>
