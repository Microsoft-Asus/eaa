    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss one of the most pressing issues facing our country today, and that is high gas prices. Soaring energy and gas prices are burdening American families and American businesses. We can encourage greater energy efficiency and offer some relief to families and businesses by offering conservation tax incentives. And we should make home energy efficiency upgrades tax deductible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when families are choosing between buying gas and buying food, we should make it easier for American families. Congress should provide incentives for home builders and homeowners to make their homes more energy efficient. Having more energy efficient homes will help families by leaving them with more money in their wallet to pay their bills. This is also good for the environment, and also reduces our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to helping families, we should also offer investment expensing for industrial and commercial building efficiency upgrades. Helping businesses afford to be more energy efficient will help businesses afford to keep their workers employed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families cannot afford to wait any longer for relief at the pump. We need to start today to encourage greater energy efficiency by offering these tax incentives by helping families and businesses to save money and reduce their dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
