  <speaking speaker="400430" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to pay tribute on Greek Independence Day to one of America's most important European allies, Greece, and one that holds immeasurable importance to millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my good friend from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who has been a leading supporter of U.S.-Greek relations in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Western civilization as we know it today is undeniably connected to Greece. For every American, Greece is known as the cradle of democracy. As a nation that still seeks to perfect its democracy in civic society, America looks to Greece and its universally known philosophers and leaders for political inspiration and wisdom. In fact, the very word "democracy" is a Greek word. The history of Greek independence is inspiring, especially given America's own history and drive for independence from  tyranny and oppression. Greeks have been willing to fight for independence, sacrifice for the sake of freedom, and have stirred others to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress with a large Greek-American community, I am especially pleased that we are passing this resolution today, which also highlights the extraordinary contributions of a community that has contributed greatly to the shared prosperity of our Nation. Today, the Greek-American community remains the bedrock in the unbreakable bond between the United States and our ally, Greece. As ambassadors of goodwill between the United States and Greece, Greek Americans have for decades shaped  this long-standing friendship, creating a partnership based on freedom, democracy and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, some 5 million Americans claim Greek ancestry, with understandable pride. Greece is one of less than a handful of nations that have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States in every major war of the 20th century. Our close relations became even closer after World War II. The Truman Doctrine helped save Greece from communism, indeed helped save it for the Western world, and the Marshall Plan helped pave the way for economic success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1952, Greece joined NATO, formalizing the deep mutual commitment of Greece and the rest of the western world to protecting freedom. Now, as an integral member of the EU for two decades, Greece has become increasingly prosperous, a democratic role model for the nations of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greece remains a critical strategic partner in today's post-Cold War world. We cooperate closely in promoting peace and stability in the Balkans. Athens has supported efforts to settle the Cyprus problem and to end the divide on the island. And I am especially supportive of Greece's critical efforts in recent years to resolve historic differences with its neighbor, Turkey, including supporting that country's membership in the EU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Greek people on the 186th anniversary of their independence and strongly support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="228">H. Res. 228</bill>, recognizing the 186th anniversary of the independence of Greece, celebrating Greek and American democracy and recognizing Greece as a very staunch ally and friend of our United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greece was the birthplace of the principles of democracy on which our Nation was founded. Our Founders studied Greek culture and Greek politics, and their influence is still with us today. Over the centuries, Greece has demonstrated its commitment to what it and our Nation prize among our highest ideals, and that word is "liberty," "eleftheria" to the Greek people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, many of our Nation's respective ideas are shared and, therefore, our relationship holds a special significance. Both the United States and Greece share much in common. Both are outward-looking trading nations that have enriched the world through commercial and cultural exchanges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the decades the U.S.-Greek relationship has developed quite dynamically, bolstered by common ideas and cooperation. Moreover, the Greek people have strived to protect freedom and democracy, allying itself with the United States in every major conflict of the 20th century, notably sacrificing for and contributing to the victory of the Allied forces over the Axis powers during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, our common destinies are threatened by other enemies who scorn our commitment to freedom, eleftheria, and aggression from Islamic extremism looms large and threatens western civilization that was born in that country of Greece. We are grateful that the Greek people have stood against this aggression throughout the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Greece should be praised for its contributions in the global war on terror. In the war in Iraq, Greece has been responsive to U.S. requests for access to its air space and in fueling U.S. ships that supply cargo ships headed to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I look forward to further cooperation between our two nations and expanding the friendship that exists between Greek and American people. I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the nation of Greece on the 186th anniversary of its independence and to express their  acknowledgment of the great friendship that exists between our two countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400430" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to give Ms. Jackson-Lee of Texas, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 5 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished chairman and I thank my colleagues, my fellow member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, and the ranking member, Ms. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN. Certainly, I have indicated already to Chairman Wexler thanks for his continued leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise, of course, to acknowledge and certainly support recognizing the 186th anniversary of the independence of Greece and celebrating Greek and American democracy. Greece has been a long-term model, if you will, for the principles of democracy. Any of us who have had the honor of learning the Greek philosophers throughout our academic training know that the principles they have enunciated have been strong and lasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that in mind as I celebrate the 186th anniversary, I commend my friends in Greece for their continued deliberations dealing with the issue of divide between the Turks and Greece, and I look forward to an opportunity that resolutions will come about that would solve some of those problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I, Mr. Wexler, also indicate my support for <bill type="hr" number="64">H. Res. 64</bill>, which speaks to the freedom of press and particularly expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the government of Bangladesh should immediately drop all charges against Bangladeshi journalist Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury. I say that in recognition of the principles of freedom of press. Whenever we have had the opportunity to interact in bilaterals through Members of Congress or parliamentarians, one of the key  issues that are discussed is the right of the voice of the opposition, or the voice of difference to be expressed. I hope that this particular legislation will pass with a firm statement by this Congress that we are, if you will, asking for his release.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I also support <bill type="hr" number="107">H. Res. 107</bill>. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the Israeli soldiers held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah. Let me say this, I have met with one of the family members of one of the captive soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think what is important in this statement, because we know that King Abdullah just a few days ago came to this Congress and said, we can make a difference in the Palestinian-Israeli issue. This happens to be soldiers that are in Lebanon, and, frankly, I think the point should be made that Israel has, in fact, done what they said they would do in pulling back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whenever you get agreements that are kept, promises that are kept, then it seems that in the course of international collegiality or international decorum or international protocol that you have the opportunity to receive your soldiers back home, your loved ones back home. These young men, who are still being held, Gilad Shalit, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, remain in captivity, even though the United Nations has, through passing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, imposed a ceasefire  on the Lebanon-Israel border. The resolution called for, and I quote, the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers. Even in the United Nations, which has a place for disparate voices and has a place for disagreement, we find that there is a call for their release.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would hope that this particular legislation is not taken as a negative, but it is taken in compliance with the United Nations' interests in countries, recognizing when agreements are made that we can move forward on the agreement, and the captivity of soldiers of another sovereign nation certainly argues against having a world forum that really works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United Nations has managed with all its difficulties to be a world forum. It has made a statement that they should be released. I would hope there would be enough resolve in Hezbollah and certainly in Hamas and others and in Lebanon, that whatever your viewpoint, you certainly should have the view to provide comfort to these families and have their loved ones returned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask again for support of the underlying bill; that is, <bill type="hr" number="228">H. Res. 228</bill>, and I add my support for <bill type="hr" number="64">H. Res. 64</bill>; and as a cosponsor of <bill type="hr" number="107">H. Res. 107</bill>, I add my support for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude by simply saying that we have an opportunity to accept the challenge of King Abdullah in the way that we must know how to do it, and that is engagement and resolve for the best of all people in the Mideast. I hope that we will do so, and I would say to my friends in Lebanon, a good step and a good start would be the release, unconditional release of these soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="107">H. Res. 107</bill>, which calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Israeli soldiers held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah and expresses the Congress's support for a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the fighting between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah has subsided, one of the initial causes for the war, has not yet been addressed. Three young men, Gilad Shalit, Eldad Regev, and Ehud Goldwasser, remain in captivity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fighting last summer ended when the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1701, which imposed a ceasefire on the Israel-Lebanon border. That resolution unequivocally called for "the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, their ongoing captivity is ignoring the will of the international community. Indeed, Hamas and Hezbollah have not even allowed access to the Israeli captives by competent medical personnel and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="107">H. Res. 107</bill> expresses this Congress's vision for "a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside of the State of Israel." But this vision cannot be achieved by continuing to hold these soldiers by Hamas and Hezbollah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States cannot turn a blind eye when citizens of a fellow democracy fall prey to terrorists acts. Israeli soldiers must be released without delay and without preconditions, as the Security Council demands. That is also our demand. We will remain committed to the soldiers' freedom--for the sake of peace and to move toward a just resolution to these conflicts in the Mid East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support the resolution sponsored by Mr. Ackerman, the chairman of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee. I urge all my colleagues to do so as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep pride and respect to the Hellenic Republic as it prepares to celebrate the anniversary of Greek Independence Day, which took place on March 25, 1821.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am almost certain that Thomas Jefferson cast an eye across the Atlantic towards Greece when he uttered these words in 1821, "The flames kindled on the 4th of July, 1776, have not spread over much of the globe to be extinguished by the feeble engines of despotism ..... On the contrary, they will consume these engines and all who work them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is God's handiwork that I am blessed to straddle two cultures that have been beacons of liberty for all of civilization. The place of my birth, the land of the free and the home of the brave, the United States of America, and the land of my ancestors, the birthplace of democracy, the Hellenic Republic, Greece. I honor those brave and resilient Greeks who refused to be assimilated or converted into the Ottoman Empire. They endured centuries of torture and persecution to hang on to their precious  heritage and faith. Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the emblem of freedom for Hellenes, the flag bearing a white cross and nine blue and white stripes representing the nine letters, eleftheria, freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was an act of defiance against the Ottoman Empire, marking the beginning of Greece's war of independence on March 25, 1821.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Cries of Zito I Ellas, long live Greece; Eleftheria I Thanatos, live free or die, could be heard from the Ionian to the Aegean, from the Peloponeseus to the Dodocanese where my grandparents are from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It took 8 hard-fought years, until 1829, for the Sultan Mahmud to capitulate and surrender. Greek independence  was guaranteed with the Treaty of Adrianople.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greeks were the first Ottoman subjects to secure recognition as an independent and sovereign nation. It was a fierce fight that drew support from Philhellenes the world over. None other than the United States, England, Lord Byron was wonderful in this cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Undoubtedly, these Philhellenes were indebted to Greece, the world's first advanced civilization, for providing a cultural heritage that has influenced the world with firsts in philosophy, politics, mathematics, science, art and sport with the Olympics, just to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I honor my ancestors for their deep abiding conviction in all that is good and true about mankind. I celebrate their bravery and commitment to freedom and justice. I praise their perseverance and patience in the face of unspeakable hardships. I commend their sacrifices to posterity so that, should there ever be another who seeks to oppress freedom-loving people, we will be able to look upon history and summon up the same courage that those unyielding Hellenes exhibited nearly two centuries ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as our great Founding Fathers studied the model of democracy the ancient Greeks put forth, it is likely our revolution for independence in the late 18th century served as a blueprint for the early 19th-century Greeks to try their hand at freedom and sovereignty. It is a beautiful, symbolic symbiotic relationship that the United States and Greece have shared since, and it continues to enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As George Washington proclaimed at the onset of the American Revolution: "Our cause is noble. It is the cause of mankind." So it was in 1776 America and in 1821 Greece, and so it will always remain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zito I Ellas, and God bless America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady from New York (Mrs. Maloney), who also is the cochair of the Hellenic Caucus.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of this legislation, <bill type="hr" number="228">H. Res. 228</bill>, and cochair and cofounder of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, I rise today to celebrate the 186th anniversary of Greece's independence from the Ottoman Empire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Against incredibly difficult odds, the Greeks defeated one of the most powerful empires in history to gain their independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following 400 years of Ottoman rule, in March 1821, Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the traditional Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting his countrymen to rise up against the Ottoman Empire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bishop timed this act of revolution to coincide with the Greek Orthodox holiday celebrating the archangel Gabriel's announcement that the Virgin Mary was pregnant with the divine child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Germanos' message to his people was clear, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece. The following year, the Treaty of Constantinople established full independence of Greece.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate Greek Independence Day, we should reflect upon the strong ties between Greece and the United States and the strong commitment to democracy shared by our two countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Greeks of 1821 fought for independence from the Ottoman Empire while drawing inspiration from the ideals and institutions of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During their war of independence, the Greeks also received support from many Americans, including Presidents James Madison and James Monroe and Representatives Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, each of whom gave speeches and made resolutions and other statements in Congress in support of the Greek revolutionaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as our defeat of the British Army was remarkable, so too was the Greek triumph over the Ottoman Army, a momentous achievement in world history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New York City is home to the largest Hellenic population outside of Greece and Cyprus. Western Queens, which I have the honor of representing, is often called Little Athens because of the large Hellenic population in its neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Yorkers celebrate Greek Independence Day with a parade on Fifth Avenue, along with many cultural events, private meetings and celebrations. These events, hosted by the Federation of Hellenic Societies and other Hellenic and Philhellenic organizations and friends, remind us of the Hellenic American community's many, many contributions to our Nation's history and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Relations between the United States and Greece remain strong with a shared commitment to ensuring stability in southeastern Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope permanent solutions can be found for ending the division of Cyprus and finding a mutually agreed upon name for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, I strongly support the inclusion of Greece in the Visa Waiver Program. Last month, along with Representatives SPACE and BILIRAKIS and 18 of our House colleagues, we sent letters to Secretary Rice and Secretary Chertoff urging them to extend the Visa Waiver Program to Greece. Greece is the only member of the original 15 European Union nations not to belong to the Visa Waiver Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Greece has met the criteria for the program, including a less than 3 percent refusal rate of U.S. nonimmigrant visa applicants and biometric passports. I hope that they will soon be included in the program, and I ask my colleagues and the Nation to join me in celebrating Greek's independence today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, it is my sincere pleasure to pay tribute to the New York Hellenic American community for its many, many contributions to our city and Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Affairs, I am proud to congratulate the nation of Greece on the 186th anniversy of independence. Though it began the cradle of Democracy and formed the foundation of Western thought, Greece was ruled over by various empires until 1821 when the people of Greece threw off Ottoman oppression and set about founding a government that would be ruled by Greeks and for Greeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ancient Greek city-states provided young American with a strong foundation of government and philosophy to build our democracies. In both our nations, the Golden Age of Greece continues to be a guiding light.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the last 50 years, the United States has been proud to stand with the Greek people as they confronted communist oppression, solidified their democracy, and became part of the vibrant European economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Independence, once achieved, is not guaranteed for all time. We know that at all times there must be those who are willing to sacrifice to retain liberty. Both of our nations have faced struggles for survival since the initial moment of independence. We must continue to support each other in the causes of freedom and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I congratulate the Greek people on this historic day. It is a day to remember the sacrifices of the past, to take pride in your nation, and to look forward to a bright future.</paragraph>
