  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush has once again used his veto pen to stifle scientific research. Yesterday, the President vetoed bipartisan legislation passed by this Congress that would have expanded potentially lifesaving stem cell research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act would have authorized Federal funds to be used for research on embryonic stem cell lines derived from embryos at in vitro fertilization clinics that would otherwise have been discarded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An overwhelming number of Americans, including doctors, scientists, health organizations, and communities of faith have been vocal in their support for this critical research because of cures it might offer to those stricken with diabetes, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cancer, spinal cord injuries and countless other ailments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush's decision to once again veto an expansion of this research that could bring hope to millions with life-threatening and debilitating diseases is dangerous to those who are suffering. This Democratic House will continue to push for Federal funding of this ethical and critically necessary research.</paragraph>
