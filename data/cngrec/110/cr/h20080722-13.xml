    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in strong support of <bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill>, the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge Bravery Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This excellent measure establishes a formal process by which Congress will be able to recognize acts of bravery of all of our Nation's law enforcement officers who become injured in the course of their duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the more than 70 Federal law enforcement agencies, only two have an awards programs to recognize their officers. Such scant recognition for the sacrifices that these officers make is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation builds on legislation the House passed in April, <bill type="h" number="4056">H.R. 4056</bill>, authored by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth), to accord Congressional recognition for the dangers Federal law enforcement officers face for our safety each day. <bill type="h" number="4056">H.R. 4056</bill> would have established a meaningful and long-overdue system to honor deserving officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill> takes a somewhat different approach. It extends recognition for State and local law enforcement officers, as well as Federal officers, injured in the line of duty. A Member of Congress or the Attorney General would be authorized to present, on behalf of Congress, a Congressional Badge of Bravery not only to Federal officers but also to any State or local officers cited by the Attorney General based upon the recommendation of a board established by this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the men and women in law enforcement, like many hardworking public servants, must work long and often irregular hours unlike other public servants. However, law enforcement officers undertake their responsibilities with the full knowledge that they are at risk of severe injury or worse, and it is fitting that we honor these officers for whom the risk becomes the reality. <bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill> will now accord these brave men and women formal Congressional recognition, an honor that is so much deserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth) and the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) for their leadership in this important legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill>, the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery Act of 2008. The House passed similar legislation earlier this year to honor the men and women of law enforcement who are injured in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's law enforcement officers protect our communities from street gangs and drug dealers, investigate bank robberies and kidnappings, and apprehend violent criminals. From a simple traffic stop to a complex counterterrorism investigation, our Federal, State, and local police forces put their lives on the line every day. They don't seek fame or recognition, and when honored for their bravery and sacrifice, they will simply say, "just doing our job."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are more than 100,000 Federal law enforcement officers and 900,000 State and local law enforcement officers employed across our nation. And each year approximately 150 of these Federal officers and 160,000 State and local officers are injured in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill> establishes the Congressional Badge of Bravery to honor these brave men and women. The Congressional Badge of Bravery pays tribute to law enforcement officers who demonstrate bravery in performance of their duties, face personal risk to their own safety, and were injured in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill> establishes a seven-member Badge of Bravery Board within the Department of Justice. The board is charged with designing the badge, recommending recipients, and coordinating the presentation of the award for Federal law enforcement officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill> also establishes a State and Local Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery Board within the Department to oversee the presentation of the badge to State troopers, county sheriffs, and local police officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's law enforcement officers risk their lives to protect our families and keep our communities safe. Honoring these acts of bravery is the least we can do to recognize the commitment and sacrifice of those injured in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I heard a Sunday morning service just yesterday, and the preacher asked his audience to imagine where we would be without mechanics and without electricians. He chose those two because, by his own admission, he was inept in those areas, as am I. If there are no mechanics or electricians, I'm out of luck, Mr. Scott, and I empathize with him on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think by the same token, think where we would be in this country and in this world without law enforcement and without firefighters. These are some oftentimes professions that we may take lightly and for granted, but indeed we should not because they are indeed significant to our well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share with my friend from Virginia (Mr. Scott) in urging my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="2565">S. 2565</bill> to establish an awards mechanism to honor exceptional acts of bravery in the line of duty by Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers. This bill will provide a mechanism to honor exceptional acts of bravery in the line of duty by Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers. In sum this bill provides a mechanism to honor for their service and bravery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are more than 900,000 sworn law enforcement officers serving in the United States; the highest figure ever. On average, more than 56,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted each year, resulting in over 16,000 injuries with an average of 150 of those injuries sustained by Federal law enforcement officers. While members of the military receive the Purple Heart when wounded or killed, most Federal law enforcement officers receive no such commendation for their sacrifice. In fact, of the  over 70 Federal agencies that employ Federal law enforcement agents, only two agencies award medals and commendations for physical injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This must change. Both the military and our law enforcement officers protect the citizens of our great country every single day. If we can acknowledge the sacrifices made by the military, we can recognize those made by law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for all of our law enforcement officers to receive the recognition they deserve. This bill authorizes the Attorney General to award a Congressional Badge of Bravery to a Federal law enforcement officer who sustains a physical injury in the line of duty and to  award a State and Local Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery to a State or local law enforcement officer who is cited by the Attorney General for performing such an act of bravery  while in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and support the law enforcement community. I would also note that this bill has support from both the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and the Fraternal Order of Police, organizations with over 26,000 and 325,000 members, respectively. These men and women serve our country every single day, working to keep us safe from threats ranging from terrorists to petty thieves. It is our duty to see that they receive the recognition they so rightly  deserve.</paragraph>
