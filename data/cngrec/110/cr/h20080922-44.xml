    <bill type="hr" number="1390">H. Res. 1390</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas barely 18 percent of 12th grade students perform at or above the proficient level in science;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the need for science education, especially outside the classroom, is crucial to our country's ability to remain globally competitive;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas today only 32.4 percent of undergraduates in the United States are leaving college with a bachelor's degree in science or engineering, compared to 63.3 percent in Japan, 62.1 percent in Germany, and 56.2 percent in China;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas American businesses will face a competitive crisis with the advancing science- and technology-driven global economy unless they have a workforce that has been trained in scientific fields;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the future global economy will be driven by market sectors that are based in science, engineering, and technology;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas current scientists and engineers are retiring in record numbers, creating a potentially large void of skilled workers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 4-H and other out-of-school programs that focus on science, engineering and technology are an important part of educating and developing leaders who are well-trained and technically competent;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 4-H is preparing America's future workforce by developing their passion for science, engineering, and technology at an early age;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 4-H's educational programs have an unparalleled reach of more than 6,000,000 youth in all 50 States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 4-H, in partnership with more than 106 land-grant universities, shape programs in the sciences that are important to today's workforce and critical for managing the world's resources for years to come;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas youth, parents, teachers, schools, and youth organizations have the ability to participate in fun, accessible, science-related activities that encourage youth exploration and experimentation at an early age; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas October 8, 2008 would be an appropriate day to designate as 4-H National Youth Science Day: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) expresses support for the designation of a 4-H National Youth Science Day;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe 4-H National Youth Science Day;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) encourages young people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue science studies and enter into science careers.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="hr" number="1390">H. Res. 1390</bill>, the resolution now under consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1390 and 4-H programs across America. 4-H works with over 6 million youths in all 50 States to help develop citizenship, leadership and life skills. 4-H has been doing this and doing it well for over 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What some people may not know is that one of 4-H's primary focuses today is in the area of science and technology. Through its summer camps, fairs, cultural events and other programs, 4-H has focused on the goal of providing American youths with a solid background in science and technology. Moreover, 4-H programs get children excited and interested in these fields, which we know is a critical element in a child's education success in the sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this resolution correctly points out, American students consistently rank behind our international peers in the fields of science and technology. We clearly need to do more if we want to ensure that the next generation of Americans have the high-tech skills to compete in the global marketplace. That is why it is so important that organizations like 4-H continue to do the excellent work they are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the sponsor of this resolution, Mr. Cardoza, for recognizing the importance of the work of 4-H in the advancement of science, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today would designate October 8 as 4-H National Youth Science Day. I, as well as 21 other Members of this body, was a proud member of 4-H and know firsthand the good work that this organization performs. "Head, heart, hands and health," that is what the four Hs stand for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With over 6 million youth participating, it is a much larger organization today than it was when I was a boy, but it has the focus of helping young people reach their full potential. That focus remains the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we discuss frequently on this floor, and as the newspapers reflect almost daily, our innovative spirit is the stronghold of the Nation's success. But we must do a better job of energizing our children to be interested in science, engineering and technology if we are to remain the world's leader in innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the 4-H National Youth Science Day is to do just that. The National Science Experiment is the designated activity for the first annual 4-H National Youth Science Day and will focus on water conservation. Through this special day and through its science, engineering and technology programs, 4-H has a goal of preparing 1 million new young people to excel in science, engineering and technology by 2013. I applaud them for these endeavors, and encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting  this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of officially recognizing October 8, 2008, as 4-H National Youth Science Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show its commitment to providing a quality science education, 4-H National Youth Science Day will take place during National 4-H Week and features a "National Science Experiment"--a designated science activity that will engage youth across the country in environmental issues relating to water conservation and groundwater contamination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 100 years ago, 4-H began with the creation of agriculture projects geared at ensuring the future of our Nation's rural youth. Today, with a membership of 6 million young people, 4-H is America's largest youth organization and is an essential tool to engage and educate our future generations of scientists and inventors at a young age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own daughter Brittany had a very positive experience with 4-H in California learning  how to sew and quilt and raising her heifer named Lucy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>4-H's efforts to make science education enjoyable and interesting are noteworthy as barely 18 percent of 12th grade students in the United States are currently performing at or above the proficient level in science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, only 32.4 percent of undergraduates in America are leaving college with a bachelor's degree in science or engineering, and a majority of scientists believe that the United States is falling behind in science and innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to these sobering statistics, the National Academy of Sciences issued the timely report Rising Above the Gathering Storm, calling for an ambitious national program to address the need for increased math and science education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the report, two important factors that America depends on to compete successfully in the global marketplace are: (1) a well-trained and technically competent workforce; and (2) the production of scientific and technological innovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing and promoting these goals is critical if America is going to remain a competitive leader in the global economy, and assistance from programs like 4-H will be vital in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in my support for <bill type="hr" number="1390">H. Res. 1390</bill> to officially recognize October 8, 2008, as 4-H National Youth Science Day and encourage young people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue their interest in science and innovation.</paragraph>
