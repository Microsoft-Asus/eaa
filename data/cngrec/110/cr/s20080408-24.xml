  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana especially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is sorrow in our Bluff City on the Mississippi River and across Tennessee today because the noble University of Memphis Tigers lost last night to Kansas in the finals of the NCAA National Championship basketball tournament. But there is also reason for great pride. The ebullient John Calapiari and his team gave Memphis a new source of pride and the sport a season to remember, winning more games than any college basketball team ever has. Years from now, fans will be talking about the magical  Douglas-Roberts, the indomitable Dorsey, the ubiquitous Anderson, the reliable Dozier, the explosive Rose, and the super sub Taggart. They have given fans a great year. They have helped unify Tennessee's largest city. They should hold their heads high as we look toward next year.</paragraph>
