  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to submit a resolution congratulating the Philadelphia Phillies on winning the 2008 World Series. On October 29, 2008, the Phillies defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 4 to 3 in Game 5 to secure a World Series title for the first time since 1980 and second time in team history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic victory was the culmination of a hard-fought 2008 regular season and an exhilarating postseason run for the Phillies. On September 27, the Phillies beat the Washington Nationals to clinch the National League East Division for the second consecutive year. They would go on to defeat the Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division Series and National League Championship Series, respectively, to advance to their first World Series since 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the World Series, the Phillies faced a young and talented Tampa Bay Rays team, led by Manager, and Pennsylvania native, Joe Maddon. With strong performances from their starting pitchers, an outstanding bullpen and well-timed hitting, the Phillies beat the Rays in five games to clinch the title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the Senate and as an ardent Phillies fan myself, I congratulate the Philadelphia Phillies on winning the 2008 World Series and bringing to my hometown of Philadelphia a major sports championship for the first time in 25 years. In particular, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to manager Charlie Manuel, who, since taking the helm as manager in 2005, has guided this young Phillies team to become the best in Major League Baseball. Further due special recognition is 24-year-old pitcher  Cole Hamels, who was named the Most Valuable Player for both the National League Championship Series and World Series with a 4-0 record and 1.80 earned run average in the postseason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also deserving of much praise are the 2008 American League Championship Rays. Though they had endured 10 consecutive losing seasons and the worst record in baseball last season, the Rays won their division and the 2008 American League Championship Series. The Rays have a bright future and I wish them continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, and perhaps more importantly, I congratulate all Phillies fans, who could finally enjoy that parade  down Broad Street they so well deserve. Philadelphia sports fans have consistently demonstrated their love for and devotion to Philadelphia teams, even after 25 years without winning a major sports championship. While we have a reputation of being somewhat rough around the edges, Philadelphia fans are enthusiastic about sports and fiercely loyal  to our teams. We also have a reputation for not resting on our laurels and demanding a lot from those players and coaches privileged to wear our teams' uniforms. I therefore urge my Phillies to keep fighting and bring home another title next year.</paragraph>
