    <paragraph>Mr. President, on October 23, 2007, Senator DeMint and I  had a debate in the Senate on Senator DeMint's amendment to strike $3.7 million in grants in the Appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services and Education with $2.2 million going to the AFL-CIO Appalachian Council and $1.5 million to the AFL-CIO Working for America Institute. This funding applied to job-training programs covering some 11 States and the  District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of the debate, Senator DeMint made the following statement:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is part of an effort to clear up what a lot of us have called the culture of corruption over the last several years. A lot of this has come from Americans connecting the dots between the earmarks that we give to our favorite causes back home and many of the campaign contributions and political support that we get back here in Congress. While motivations are generally good, at best the appearance of what is going on here has alarmed the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I outlined my reasons for supporting these grants, Senator DeMint replied:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with all the purposes the Senator stated, all of the ideas of getting teenagers to work in Philadelphia. All of those things are good. I am not taking argument with any of them. If the AFL-CIO is the best source to deliver these services, there should not be any problem with this at all. All we are asking is to make this a competitive grant so that we can have criteria and accountability in a system so that what we want to accomplish will actually get accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator DeMint's amendment was rejected on a 60-34 vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the floor debate and vote were over, Senator DeMint and I discussed the issues in the debate. Senator DeMint stated that he was not suggesting any corrupt practice or inappropriate conduct by me, but only that it was preferable to use the funds for competitive bids. Senator DeMint and I agreed that it would be useful to correct any misimpressions by having this colloquy for the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Senator Specter has correctly stated the conversation which we had after the floor debate and we agreed it would be useful to have this discussion to clear up the record. As I told Senator Specter privately and now state publicly, I was in no way suggesting that his support for these programs resulted from campaign contributions or political support. My reference to the "culture of corruption" was not intended to suggest that there was any corruption involved  in this matter. In my statement, I was specific in not suggesting inappropriate motivations when I said "motivations are generally good." I was also careful to focus on the "appearance" and not the reality by noting it "has alarmed the American people." As many know, my objection to earmarks has to do with the</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank Senator DeMint for his candid and forceful statements which I think clear the record.</paragraph>
