  <narrative>SENATOR PETE DOMENICI -- (Senate - September 27, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9972">S9972</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may, to Senator Domenici, with whom I have worked on the Energy Committee since I came to the Senate, I want to give him my accolades and also to wish him well in his days ahead. When I arrived in the Senate some 3 1/2  years ago, he was one of the people who welcomed me here. He welcomed me here as the man from the land of enchantment, la Tierra Encantada, as we say in Spanish in New Mexico. He did so in large part because many of my family members are  from the State of New Mexico. My family helped found the city of Santa Fe, the city of Holy Faith, now over 400 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During many times as I was growing up as a young man, and later on in my professional life, traveling in New Mexico, I would hear about the great Senator of New Mexico, the great PETE DOMENICI. Now, for the last 4 years it has been a tremendous privilege and personal honor for me to be able to serve with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make two comments about him--first, in terms of the substance of the legislation that we have worked on together. We have passed three significant pieces of bipartisan energy legislation with him--in 2005, the Energy Policy Act of that year; again, we passed another energy package in 2006; and again in 2007. In the passage of those major pieces of legislation, it was Senator Domenici, working closely with his good friend, Senator Bingaman, who said that we could agree  on things for the future of this country on this signature issue that is so important to our national security and to our economic prosperity. He brought us together to make sure that we would work on those things that we all agreed upon. That is why we were able to pass those very important pieces of legislation. I very much appreciate what he has done in that committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, as he and I have talked many times over the last several years, there are issues that are unique to the West, the issues of public lands, where much of our lands--for example, in my State of Colorado, 33 percent is owned by the Federal Government. It takes an understanding of those realities, of issues like payment in lieu of taxes, or how we deal with the mining law in the West, or how we make sure that the water issues of the West are protected, and how we recognize the compacts of  our States as being important. For all those issues he has been a tremendous leader and an inspiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss him dearly as a friend. He has been a dear friend. But I also will miss his leadership because on so many issues he has worked across the aisle. I appreciate his leadership as well in what he has done for mental health parity for the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be not hundreds of thousands, not millions, but hundreds of millions of Americans who will come to benefit from his leadership on the mental health parity issue. Also, the building blocks he has laid for us to try to take the moon shot that will get us energy independence. Those building blocks will remain in place for decades and for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate his leadership, and I appreciate his service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to thank my good friend, Senator Salazar, from the State of Colorado. I don't know what brought us together on our Energy Committee. Maybe it was a little bit of common language--we both spoke a little Spanish to each other, and it made us both understand and feel like we were friends. But we became that, we became friends rather quickly in his short 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I obviously remember your very first 6 months when we became friends and worked on many issues. I compliment you on your constant effort to work in a bipartisan way on issues. It is tough around here. It is going to have to move in that direction or we are going to continue to have trouble getting things done. For that, I hope you will stand your ground and at least keep trying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the kind words you said in my behalf. Let's hope we see each other frequently, if not in your State, in New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Senator.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, these are one of the periods of our lives in the Senate we shall always remember. My good friend, the Senator from New Mexico, steps down and departs the floor. But you will be a Member of this decisionmaking body through the next few days, which will be critical when your vast experience will be brought to bear on this decision, as it will.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Senator, I tell you, I said a little bit in my remarks a while ago about it. I get very excited and anxious because it takes too long. But that is the deliberative body. But we don't have a long time to give the Secretary of the Treasury the kind of authority he needs to fix a broken train.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a wreck--lots of wrecks. All the freeways are clogged. We have to take away the things that are clogging them. We could look at it as a freeway with cracked-up cars, but actually the assets that are piled up there are the toxic assets that have been accumulated by those banks. If you don't get them out of the way, the line continues growing because of the broken-down cars, the toxic assets. The running cars can run no more. They are stopped in place. They contain everything that has  given us a decent life in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to fix that. I am going to be here. Let's hope our negotiators will put something together that the executive branch tells us will work and that the world accepts it with confidence. When we come off this floor, when we vote that in--whatever it is, Monday or whatever--we will join, you and I, with great confidence that we have once again done something important.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was present today in our group of Senators. When you spoke, you inspired them. We have got to rebuild the confidence in America. That is what underlies this decision. I also wish to say a few words about our dear friend from Colorado. I cannot altogether make these remarks without divulging I have a bias. I have visited that beautiful State many times. But my daughter makes her home there, together with my grandson, and the Senator from Colorado allowed my grandson  to be an intern in his office. He served as an intern briefly in my office, both without pay to the taxpayers, I hasten to say, when I make these remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But he has been a great friend. We have worked together on many things. He has dignity. But above all it is his enthusiasm and love for this institution. There is not a day when he walks on this floor, either to say to other Senators or to say it quietly to himself: How fortunate I am to be a Senator, to come here to represent the people of Colorado, to represent the people, as each Senator does, of the whole of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as I step down, and others, we do so with a sense of confidence, behind us remain individuals like yourself and indeed the distinguished Presiding Officer who for 30 years, he and I have  served together on the Armed Services Committee. He will remain on. The Senate will be in good hands with you and our other colleagues to carry on and solve the problems for this great Nation and indeed much of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
