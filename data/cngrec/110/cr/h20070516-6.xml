  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday I spoke on the floor of this House about the Food Stamp Challenge, an initiative where public officials live for 1 week on a food stamp budget in order to raise awareness of the Food Stamp program. Three of my esteemed colleagues, Representatives JO ANN EMERSON from Missouri, TIM RYAN from Ohio, and JAN SCHAKOWSKY from Illinois, are also taking part in the Food Stamp Challenge. We started yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not easy eating on $3 a day. But it is nothing compared to the hardship faced by millions of Americans every single day. I urge my colleagues to read more about our experiences on the Food Stamp Challenge blog at foodstampchallenge.typepad.com.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week my colleagues will be joining me in talking about the Food  Stamp program and how we can better meet the needs of low-income Americans.</paragraph>
