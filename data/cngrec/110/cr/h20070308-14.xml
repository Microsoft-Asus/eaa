  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my college, the University of North Texas, back in my district, on Tuesday night won the Sun Belt Conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Calvin Watson, a forward, scored 24 points and hit six of seven 3-point shots against Arkansas State University and was named the tournament's most outstanding player.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of North Texas was locked in a tight game but made all the key plays down the stretch to pull out an 83-75 win at the Cajundome to claim not only the Sun Belt title but an NCAA tournament bid as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of North Texas, my college men's basketball team, last went to the NCAA tournament when Reagan was President during the 1987-1988 season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mean Green claimed its second NCAA bid by closing the game on an 11-5 run to set off a wild celebration. My team is under the leadership of head coach Johnny Jones. They were the No. 5 seed in the tournament and had to win all of their games to win the tournament title. They came up with standout performance throughout the tournament and in the finals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the fine men of the men's basketball team, their coaches and the staff of the University of North Texas on a great win.</paragraph>
