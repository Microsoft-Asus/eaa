  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="CORPORAL KYLE WESTON WILKS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join Arkansans today in mourning the loss of Cpl Kyle Weston Wilks of Rogers, AR. He paid the ultimate sacrifice to stand up for democracy and peace. We are grateful for Corporal Wilks' service to our Nation and we will honor his memory. I know his family and friends will remember this fallen hero's great smile and penchant for life, including playing sports and watching Razorback football and NASCAR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A marine with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit since September 2004, Corporal Wilks helped with the evacuation of Beirut in 2006 and most recently served in Afghanistan. During this time, Corporal Wilks was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before his second deployment, Corporal Wilks visited New York to see Ground Zero, which reaffirmed his commitment to military service and his country. He was a true patriot who planned to use his training as a military policeman to begin a career in law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Arkansas has now lost over 70 soldiers in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As long as I serve in public office, I will work to honor their service, live up to their courage, and protect the principles they fought to preserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Wilks has said his parents, Randy and Kathy Wilks, were his heroes. My prayers are with them, as well as his sister Makayla, during this difficult time.</paragraph>
