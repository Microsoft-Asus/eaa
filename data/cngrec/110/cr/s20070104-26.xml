    <paragraph>Mr. President, I send to the desk en bloc 12 unanimous consent requests. I ask unanimous consent that the requests be considered en bloc, that the requests be agreed to en bloc, and that they appear separately in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the Chair rules, I wish to point out that these requests are routine and are done at the beginning of every new Congress. They entail issues such as authority for the Ethics Committee to meet, authorizing the Secretary to receive reports at the desk, establishing leader time each day and floor privileges for House parliamentarians.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
