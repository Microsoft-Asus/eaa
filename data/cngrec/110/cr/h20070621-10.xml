    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our current trade policies have had devastating consequences for families and communities in northeast Ohio and across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effects of these damaging trade policies are no longer theoretical; they are real. We need a truly new trade model that addresses the concerns raised by the American people in the last election. Congress must reclaim its constitutional authority over trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must have strong and enforceable standards in our trade agreement. We must address the ever-evolving unfair trade practices used by foreign governments to protect their markets, such as currency manipulation, illegal subsidies and product dumping. We must replace policies that reward businesses for outsourcing jobs with incentives and sensible tax policies that will help our businesses and workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a new trade model now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
