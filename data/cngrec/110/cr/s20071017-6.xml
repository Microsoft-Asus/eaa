  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to underscore and confirm we are working hard to try to get a bill or bills to the President as quickly as we can. The conferences are moving along well. I instructed my folks to make sure that Republicans know what is going on with all these conference reports. I think we have to show good faith that they are going to be some real conferences, and I am confident that will take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all our new rules, with the earmarking rules we have, we cannot do things as quickly as we used to. But there has been work going on between the staffs--Democratic and Republican staffs--on both sides of this building with the Appropriations subcommittees. As a result of that, I think the final conference product should move fairly quickly.</paragraph>
