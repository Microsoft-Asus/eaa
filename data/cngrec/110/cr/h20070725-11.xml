  <narrative>INTRODUCTION OF THE CHAMP ACT SHOULD RECEIVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8402]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday House Democrats introduced legislation that will provide additional low-income children with health insurance coverage they need and deserve. The Children's Health and Medicare Protection, or CHAMP, Act would reauthorize an extremely effective State Children's Health Insurance Program, known to many as the SCHIP program, which will expire September 30 if Congress does not act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If SCHIP is allowed to expire, millions of our American children could lose their health insurance. In a letter issued last weekend, bipartisan Governors at the National Governors Association meeting called for urgent action to reauthorize SCHIP. They know, as do Democrats in Congress, that this program is vital for ensuring children in low-income families to have better access to health care. That is why passing the CHAMP Act is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, SCHIP was created almost 10 years ago by this Congress with bipartisan support and now enjoys the support of many Governors across the other aisle. I hope Republicans in this body will listen to their gubernatorial colleagues and join us in passing the new CHAMP Act.</paragraph>
