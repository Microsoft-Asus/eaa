    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when the Democratic Congress was elected last November, we pledged to enact measures to protect and support our military troops and veterans. Since taking office, we have honored that promise by passing important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the House has passed the largest increase for veterans health care in the history of the Veterans Administration, has made major improvements in equipment and training, including protecting the mine resistant ambush protected vehicles that reduce the strain on our servicemen and women and protect them in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we continue that commitment by passing the Defense authorization conference report, which includes a much-needed 3.5 percent pay increase for our troops, improves military health care, and requires a report on the current state of readiness for our forces, which are stretched very thin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Congress has a proud record this year of supporting our troops and veterans. I hope all of our colleagues will join in continuing these efforts by supporting the Department of Defense authorization conference report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Veterans Day and Memorial Day, we honor those who have served and given their lives. This vote today honors those who serve us every day. I urge the President to sign this legislation once it has passed the Congress.</paragraph>
