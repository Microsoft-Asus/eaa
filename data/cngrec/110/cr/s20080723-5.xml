    <paragraph>Tomorrow, July 24, there will be a 10th anniversary commemoration of the murder of U.S. Capitol Police Officers Chestnut and Gibson. As I indicated yesterday, there will be a moment of silence throughout the Capitol at 3:40 p.m. in remembrance of the fallen officers. That was the time they were killed. Senators are encouraged to be at their desks in the Senate Chamber for that moment of silence.</paragraph>
