  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we will once again hear from the Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, on the prosecutor purge. When it comes to the U.S. Attorney firings in public corruption cases, we have heard plenty of different explanations from the Attorney General and his associates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have not heard is the simple truth. We know many of the fired U.S. Attorneys were pursuing public corruption cases. Contrary to the administration's earlier assertion, we know the decision to fire these prosecutors reached the highest levels of government in the administration and involved Members of Congress and Republican Party officials. So this administration either originally hired incompetent U.S. Attorneys in the first place, or hired competent attorneys but incompetently fired  them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Which is it? Are the public corruption cases that implicate Members of their own party off limits in the Bush Justice Department? Is this blind justice? Democrats have been asking these questions for months and for months, and we have been consistently told other stories. Now the time for misdirection is over. Today we will demand and seek the truth.</paragraph>
