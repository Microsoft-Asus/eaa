  <speaking speaker="412198" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the President's 2008 budget proposal does not properly address the concern of American families. President Bush once again proposes substantial cuts to programs so important to our districts like Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. He then uses those funds not to offset our country's massive debt, but instead to fund expensive tax cuts that do not grow our economy and give it to people who need it the least. Unfortunately, budgets like this are  what we have come to expect from an administration with the worst financial fiscal record in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 6 years of the Bush administration, the government has posted the highest deficits in history,  squandering billions of dollars in budget surpluses and making massive cuts to vital programs. The President's misguided priorities have forced him to borrow money from foreign nations like China and Japan, more than all of 42 Presidents combined. This is not a record to be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot handle more of the same, and unfortunately that is what this budget proposes. I stand ready to work with Democrats and Republicans to take our Nation in a new direction of fiscal responsibility. We plan to do that.</paragraph>
