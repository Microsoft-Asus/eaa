    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is the 112th day since a great injustice took place in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 17, 2007, two United States Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11- and 12-year sentences respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Agent Compean and Agent Ramos were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our borders into Texas. These agents never should have been prosecuted. Yet, the U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler. The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and has sued the border patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. And he  is not an American citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people have not forgotten Agents Ramos and Compean, who should have been commended instead of indicted. I encourage citizens across this country to continue calling the White House and ask the President to use his authority to immediately pardon these two heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of Congress and the American people are outraged and concerned with this administration's indifference to the plight of two honorable men who have been crucified unfairly by a Federal prosecutor. These two agents have given years of their lives in service to this Nation; yet they have been unjustly punished for doing their job to protect the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By using the power of his office to pardon these two agents, the President has the opportunity to reverse a grave injustice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to share part of the comments made by Chairman John Conyers on the floor last week following my remarks on these two border agents, and I quote the chairman: "It's important that the kinds of concerns you have raised are known to all of our men and women who carry badges and weapons defending us, not just at borders, but in every State in the Union." Again, that is a quote from Chairman John Conyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Conyers for his interest in this issue, and I am encouraged that the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee will soon move forward with hearings to investigate the injustice committed against these two border agents.</paragraph>
