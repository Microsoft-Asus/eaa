    <paragraph>Mr. President, with gas prices soaring, the effects are being felt all across my State of Ohio. In the last year and a half, I have held 110 roundtables, talking to people in 75 of Ohio's 88 counties, listening to what they are telling me about gas prices and about other challenges: food prices, the cost of energy to heat their homes--all of those. School districts in Appalachia are contemplating going to 4-day school weeks just to cut down on the amount of gas the buses will use.  The bicycle police academy in Columbus is being forced to turn applicants away, as community after community is looking to put police on bicycles in order to keep fuel costs down. Police and fire departments across Ohio are struggling to keep community services going while facing crippling gas prices. Our truckers, our farmers, and our businesses are struggling and are often forced to raise the prices of their goods and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This price increase is devastating to our poorest populations, who, come winter, will be facing a double whammy: trying to pay for gasoline to get to work and for either natural gas or heating oil to heat their homes. We are deep into this energy crisis, and while Americans are currently most affected at the pump, we cannot forget that winter is around the corner. Fuel prices are still on the rise. We have witnessed a nearly 40 percent rise in heating oil already this year. That means Americans  are going to need all the relief they can get this winter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When pocketbooks are drained to pay heating bills, families are forced too often to make very difficult decisions. It is money families can use to put food on the table, pay for transportation, buy winter coats or other necessities for their children. That is why we have LIHEAP, which we just voted on and which, on basically a party-line vote, Republicans oppose. The LIHEAP program is geared toward preventing families from facing this heat-or-eat dilemma. But despite its success, current funding  levels do not meet its demands. That is why LIHEAP is so crucial. It would assist the elderly, assist moderately low-income families, and other low-income individuals who already experience financial strain as their wages remain stagnant but they have</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An increase in LIHEAP funding would also increase the Weatherization Assistance Program, which prevents families from wasting energy while also providing good-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Marietta, a few weeks ago, I met a crew of four young men who were learning a skill and assisting the elderly. They were paid $12, $13 an hour, fixing up homes, weatherizing them, cutting energy bills for the elderly, for low-income elderly residents of Washington County. They were saving on energy for all of us as energy prices keep going up, and they were learning this trade and making a difference for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given current energy strains and current financial strains Americans have already experienced, the time for Congress to act on LIHEAP is now, before Americans get left out in the cold.</paragraph>
