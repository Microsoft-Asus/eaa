    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you know, today President Bush presented his budget to the American people, and even though it is bigger and more bloated than I think it should be, I am pleased that it does include a balanced budget without raising taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As stewards of the taxpayers' money, we must be diligent in working to achieve savings and making this government run more efficiently. We have plenty of data from the GAO and from our Inspector General showing that money is wasted throughout the Federal Government, and the President's budget does target 140 programs that could and should be removed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, there is consensus among the American people that we do have a spending problem in the Federal Government. It is not a revenue problem. Tax reductions have generated record revenues. It is definitely a spending problem, and it is time that we begin to fine-tune our focus and decide what is a priority with this government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope that my colleagues on either side of this center aisle will join together, will take a good hard look at this budget, and will find a way to balance it without raising taxes.</paragraph>
