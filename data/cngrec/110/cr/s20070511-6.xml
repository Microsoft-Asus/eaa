    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we are only going to be in morning business. There are no rollcall votes today, nor will there be on Monday. However, on Monday, Senators Boxer and Inhofe, the managers of the Water Resources legislation, will be here for Members to come to the floor and debate amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that at least one Member on the majority side has agreed to be here Monday to discuss his amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, Senator Feingold discussed an amendment relating to Corps project prioritization. Senator Feingold is willing to have that amendment voted on Tuesday morning after a brief period of debate. Therefore, Members should expect a rollcall vote or multiple votes prior to the 12:30 recess on Tuesday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are unable to have the debates arranged so we have the votes on WRDA Tuesday morning, we will have a Federal district judge vote Tuesday morning. So we will have a vote Tuesday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
