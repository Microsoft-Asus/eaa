    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was driving my 14-year-old son to school this morning, listening to the radio, and it mentioned that the price of oil had increased to over $130 a barrel. My son said, Dad, why don't we just tell OPEC to produce more oil? I thought about it and I said, Well, son, as a matter of fact, President Bush was over in Saudi Arabia the other day and asked if Saudi Arabia would increase its output.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I suspect that the leaders of OPEC might turn that question around on the United States and say, Why doesn't the United States increase its output of oil?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer is Democrats have blocked every commonsense effort to expand production in this country for years now, and it's time for that opposition to stop and face reality. We need a balanced energy program in this country, one that recognizes that for the immediate future we are going to need oil and gas, and, yes, we need to develop alternative fuel sources as well. But you can't do just one. You have to do both.</paragraph>
