    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="s" number="2174">S. 2174</bill>, which designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 175 South Monroe Street in Tiffin, Ohio, as the "Paul E. Gillmor Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2174">S. 2174</bill> was introduced by Senator Voinovich of Ohio on October 17, 2007, and reported by voice vote on December 12, 2007. Congressman Gillmor was serving his 10th term in the United States House of Representatives representing the Fifth Congressional District in Ohio until his untimely death in September 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the entire House grieved and was shocked to learn that Representative Gillmor died right here at his home, the place where he prepared to come to this very House. He is very much missed on both sides of the aisle. This is a very appropriate way to remember this long-time Member of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend Senator Voinovich for seeking to honor the legacy of our late colleague and offer condolences to the family of Representative Gillmor and his colleagues in the Ohio congressional delegation and those in his district. I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield for such time as he may consume to the gentleman who now seeks to fill the shoes left by the passing of our colleague and friend, Mr. Gillmor, Mr. Bob Latta.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="2174">S. 2174</bill> sponsored by Senators Voinovich and Brown to name the United States Post Office in Tiffin, Ohio, after Paul E. Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first met the Congressman when he began his public service career over 40 years ago. Congressman Gillmor admirably served as a State senator, as president of the Ohio senate, and also of course as a United States Congressman since 1989. Congressman Gillmor cared for the people of his district and was dedicated to serving them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was taught by my father who served in this Chamber for 30 years that a true public servant is an individual who sees how much they can give of themselves to the people they represent, and I truly believe that Paul did exactly that. I think it is a fitting tribute to name a United States Post Office in Tiffin, Ohio, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He unselfishly gave of his time and energy to serve the citizens not only of the Second Senate District but also the Fifth Congressional District for over 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is truly an honor for me to follow the Congressman who served in this seat. I ask that this body approve the naming of this post office in the name of Congressman Gillmor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I express once again the condolences of every Member of this House, and for that matter the commendation to our colleague for offering this commemoration to our colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague in urging support for this bill. I traveled extensively with Paul Gillmor. He was a close friend of Henry Hyde and loved to be an advocate for a better understanding not just of the State of Ohio, but of our Nation abroad. It is very befitting that we do this and do it in a timely fashion. I move support for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of <bill type="s" number="2174">S. 2174</bill>, to designate the U.S. Post Office at 175 South Monroe Street in Tiffin, Ohio, as the "Paul E. Gillmor Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I doubt I've ever had an easier sell when it comes to convincing my colleagues to support legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As was noted repeatedly on this floor when Paul died on Sept. 5 at his home in Arlington, he was a man we all liked, even those of us on the other side of the political aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A small-town banker, a businessman, a Vietnam War vet, a former Judge Advocate General, a husband and father of five, he was known to all of us as a man who worked hard for and cared deeply about his constituents, who spent most of his life in service to his country and who, just 12 days before his death, was touring flood-ravaged areas of his beloved Ohio and trying to see how he could help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a moderate, an effective legislator and, most importantly and most memorably, a  gentleman with all the best that word represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to bestow this one last honor on our friend from the Buckeye State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) that the House suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill, <bill type="s" number="2174">S. 2174</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
