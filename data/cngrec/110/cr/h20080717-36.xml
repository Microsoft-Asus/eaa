  <narrative>HONORING ARMY MAJOR GENERAL ANTHONY CUCOLO -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6711]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia, underwent a change of command. As a member of the Armed Services Committee whose State is home to Fort Stewart, I rise today to thank Major General Rick Lynch on a job well done as he moves on to Fort Hood, Texas, and to congratulate Major General Tony Cucolo as he takes command of the 3rd ID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a command of monumental importance in the United States Army, Mr. Speaker. The 3rd Infantry Division has one of the most successful combat records of any United States Army division. It was the first conventional U.S. unit to enter Baghdad in 2003 and the first division to actually serve three tours in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major General Lynch commanded the division on this most recent tour in Iraq, during which time we saw undeniable progress. Major General Cucolo has large boots to fill. But I have every confidence that he is the right man for the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having served as brigade commander at Fort Stewart from 1999 to 2001, he is returning to familiar turf. He returns to Fort Stewart from the Pentagon, where he served as the Army's chief of public affairs for the past 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me, and all of our colleagues, in honoring these two fine soldiers for their service to our Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
