  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Dr. Al Simone, an outstanding individual in the community of Rochester, New York. Dr. Simone retires this month from the presidency of the Rochester Institute of Technology. He was RIT's eighth president, the eighth in 177 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Simone came to Rochester from a place where the weather is a little bit more predictable. He was the president of the University of Hawaii system and chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Manoa for 9 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Simone has led RIT to become the one of the Nation's leading career-oriented universities with 15,500 students from all 50 States and more than 100 foreign countries, 2,800 faculty and staff, and an annual operating budget of more than $490 million. RIT is now the tenth largest private university in the Nation in terms of full-time undergraduate enrollment. The endowment has climbed to more than $570 million during his tenancy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Simone is a prolific writer and has written several books and numerous journal publications on the application of mathematics, statistics, and computers to economics and business. In fact, Dr. Simone is collecting data and information for a book right now on higher education, which he expects to write within the next few years during his retirement on the sunny shores of Keuka Lake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Simone is a real trailblazer. He was the first American university president, for instance, to officially visit North Korea, Vietnam, and Vladivostock when these areas were closed to the United States except for cultural and educational exchange.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Boston, Dr. Simone received his B.A. in economics from Tufts University and his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has taught at Tufts, MIT, Northeastern University, Boston College, Boston University, University of Cincinnati, and the University of Hawaii.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community will certainly miss Al's leadership and I know I will miss working with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me in wishing him and his wife, Carolie, a long, happy, healthy retirement with their children and their grandchildren.</paragraph>
