    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, just 2 weeks ago today, tens of thousands of residents from the Fifth Congressional District of Massachusetts supported my candidacy because they wanted to make sure that all our children have health insurance. Two days later, I began my service to the Fifth District by proudly voting to override President Bush's veto of a children's health care bill that had overwhelming bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the veto was upheld, but the fact remains that millions of children that need health care don't have it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Thursday, I again voted to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program, a program that was first developed in Massachusetts and is now critical to the newly enacted Massachusetts health insurance plan. Every concern raised by the President has been clearly addressed in this bill, but he still threatens to veto it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will stand with the strong bipartisan majority, ready to overturn this veto and give 200,000 children in Massachusetts and millions more across the country a chance at a healthy, safe future. I urge the President to sign the bill.</paragraph>
