    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we have been greeted with a torrent of depressing news about Iraq, more violence, there is debate here about whether or not it is progress that the President plans to have the same troop level next summer that we had before the surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no good way out. Keep the troops there and have bloodshed; have them leave and have bloodshed. But there is one thing that every Member of Congress ought to be able to agree upon, no matter what their position on the war in Iraq: That we have a moral and practical responsibility to step up and help those Iraqis who have put their life at risk because they help Americans as guides, as translators. As Ambassador Ryan Crocker pointed out this last week, it is time for us to step up and  help these people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security needs to have more people processing applications for those that are trying to escape the worst humanitarian crisis in the world other than Darfur. Don't make them leave Iraq for Syria or Jordan to apply when we have the largest embassy in the world in Baghdad. Support our comprehensive bipartisan legislation, <bill type="h" number="2265">H.R. 2265</bill>, to help meet that responsibility.</paragraph>
