    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week I had the privilege of spending a morning at Food and Friends, an organization that provides high-nutrient meals and nutrition therapy for people living with life-threatening illnesses, like HIV/AIDS, cancer and diabetes. It's located right here in Washington, DC. Five of my esteemed colleagues joined me on this visit, Representatives Jo Ann Emerson, Lois Capps, Jan Schakowsky, Barbara Lee, and Eleanor Holmes Norton. Our visit was  enlightening and inspiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food and Friends began in 1988 when Reverend Carla Gorrell began making lunch for her friend who was so sick with AIDS that she was unable to leave the house. Reverend Gorrell recognized what is so basic, and yet so often overlooked. When we treat people with diseases, she recognized that nutritious food is an essential component of any medical regimen. Today, almost 20 years later, Food and Friends remains steadfast in its mission to provide high-nutrient meals, with care and compassion, to  the critically ill in Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia. Since 1988, Food and Friends has delivered more than 10 million meals to nearly 16,000 individuals. The organization that began in a church basement now operates in a multifaceted facility with over 50 staff members and, most impressively, 1,500 dedicated volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While my colleagues and I were at Food and Friends, we learned a tremendous amount about the significance of nutritious food for those suffering from critical illnesses. Laura Otolski, one of the three full-time dieticians on staff, educated us about the importance of individually treating each client's nutritional needs. To this end, the dieticians assess clients and then collaborate with chefs to prepare 14 different meal plans, including pureed meals for individuals who cannot chew solid food  and meals for the homeless who may not have access to refrigerators and ovens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Food and Friends staff members also recognize that to treat an individual, you must also provide food for his or her children and caretakers. For example, if a mother is too sick to cook and a volunteer only delivers a meal for her, she will give it to her children and go without food. Therefore, Food and Friends delivers meals for the whole family, including a specially designed children's meal plan. For those who live beyond Food and Friends' delivery area, they are eligible for the Groceries  to Go service that provides two bags of nonperishable groceries as well as perishable frozen meals prepared by Food and Friends kitchen staff. In addition to providing food, Food and Friends offers cooking classes, nutritional counseling and even a photography workshop for clients to express themselves through art. Through its diverse programs, Food and Friends nourishes the body as well as the mind and soul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a doubt, the highlight of our visit was hearing from two Food and Friends clients, Ajani Johnson and Crystal Wood. They described the hopelessness they felt when first learning about their illnesses. How quickly he felt sick. How far her cancer had spread. But then they told us about the gift of food that changed the course of their lives. The food--and the friendship of staff and volunteers that accompanied it--renewed their physical strength and belief in their ability to fight the  disease. They became passionate when talking about the power of food to improve their quality of life while battling deadly illnesses. They also wanted us to know that they're not just clients of Food and Friends, they are also volunteers of the organization. They want others to experience the nourishment and compassion that was freely offered to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Food and Friends is not alone in serving meals to the sick in this country. It is part of a national and international network of 120 agencies collectively serving 10 million meals to individuals each year. The Association of Nutrition Services Agencies is currently working with the Congressional Hunger Center on a Food as  Medicine initiative. The purpose of the Food as Medicine campaign is to educate local and national leaders, academics  and citizens about the value of nutrition services for those fighting disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the information we need to make great strides in recognizing the therapeutic effects of nutrition for those living with life-threatening illnesses, and I urge my colleagues to work together to ensure that all critically ill Americans have access to food and nutrition therapy as part of their treatment plans. These services improve the efficacy of medications and the quality of life of those suffering and their families. It is a simple but crucial step in improving the quality of health  care in this country.</paragraph>
