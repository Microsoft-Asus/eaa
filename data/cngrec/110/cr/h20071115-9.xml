  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise again today to once again bring a sense of reality and clear light to the immigrant and Latino communities of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six months ago, my family and I went to the wake of a 19-year-old soldier who died in Iraq from my hometown of Tucson, Arizona. It was very difficult, especially when his mother asked me to tell her why he died. I should say, she spoke only Spanish. I said what I could about freedom, sacrifice, and liberty. And now, this Congress wants to change legislation to have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission not investigate or prosecute cases of discrimination if the complainant doesn't speak  English, like this young man's mother. She gave this Nation a son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I challenge, no, I demand of those proponents that want to have second-class citizenship in this country to go to that mother and tell her why.</paragraph>
