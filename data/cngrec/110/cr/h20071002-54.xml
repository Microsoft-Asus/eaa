    <paragraph>Members of the House, 50 years ago on Thursday, the Russians launched a tiny moon into space called Sputnik. They built seven satellites, one they launched which burned up as it came back to Earth. One of them is right outside the main entrance on the way to Statuary Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would invite Members to take a look at what shook the world 50 years ago and got us to wake up. Sputnik is right on the way to Statuary Hall.</paragraph>
