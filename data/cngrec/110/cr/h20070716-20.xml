  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas 40,000 people in the United States, and 1,200,000 people globally, die in road crashes each year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas another 20,000,000 to 50,000,000 people globally are injured each year as a result of speeding motor vehicles, the increasing use of motor vehicles, and rapid urbanization;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the World Health Organization has predicted that by the year 2020 the annual number of deaths from motor vehicle crashes is likely to surpass the annual number of deaths from AIDS;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the current estimated cost of motor vehicle crashes worldwide is $518,000,000,000 annually, representing between 3 and 5 percent of the gross domestic product of each nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas over 90 percent of motorist-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas according to the World Health Organization motorist-related deaths and costs continue to rise in these countries due to a lack of appropriate road engineering and injury prevention programs in public health sectors; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution designating the third Sunday of November as a day of remembrance for road crash victims and their families, and called on nations globally to improve road safety: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That Congress--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals and ideals of a world day of remembrance for road crash victims; and</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hc" number="87">H. Con. Res. 87</bill>, a bill that supports the goals and ideas for a world day of remembrance for road crash victims. <bill type="hc" number="87">H. Con. Res. 87</bill>, which has 54 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Robert Wexler on March 8, 2007. <bill type="hc" number="87">H. Con. Res. 87</bill> was reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on June 12, 2007 by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third Sunday in November is designated as a world day of remembrance for road crash victims. This resolution commemorates the 1.2 million people killed in road crashes globally, including 40,000 in the United States each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Road crashes are the second leading cause of death worldwide among young people from ages 5 to 29, and the third leading cause of death among people aged 30 to 44 years. Vehicle accidents every year have injured and disabled as many as 50 million people throughout the world. Road traffic injuries cost countries approximately $518 billion each year, which is between 1 and 5 percent of the gross domestic product of each nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this legislation to encourage the people of the United States and of the world to support and participate in programs and activities to commemorate a world day of remembrance for road crash victims with appropriate ceremonies, programs and other activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Robert Wexler, for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, every year approximately 40,000 people in the United States die in road crashes. The number worldwide is even more devastating, over 1.2 million. These tragedies are overwhelming to the victims and their families and lead to numerous unintended physical, emotional and financial hardships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="87">H. Con. Res. 87</bill> supports a world day of remembrance for road crash victims on the third Saturday of every November. According to the World Health Organization, 90 percent of motorist-related deaths occur in low and middle income countries. The countries are in need of improved road systems, increased prevention initiatives, and education programs for new drivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too many of these road crash fatalities can be prevented through legislation, consistent enforcement and better education on the use of safety precautions such as seatbelts, child restraints and helmets. Drunk driving prevention programs and campaigns such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving are useful tools to bring awareness to such tragedies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Communities and families worldwide must work together to prevent road crashes and related deaths. These traffic accidents injure or disable more than 50 million people. It is time we take these numbers into perspective to end dangerous and life-threatening vehicle crashes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hc" number="87">H. Con. Res. 87</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, we will pass <bill type="hc" number="87">H. Con. Res. 87</bill>, supporting the goals and ideals of a world day or remembrance for road crash victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation sets aside the third Sunday of November as a day of remembrance for road crash victims and their families, and calls on nations globally to improve road safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also encourages our country to support and participate in programs and activities to commemorate a world day of remembrance for road crash victims with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year 40,000 people in the U.S. die in road crashes--last year Nebraska had 226 fatal crashes, according to the Nebraska Office of Highway Safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very few of us can say we have never been affected by a road crash. It is my hope, through these educational and informative steps, we can lower the total of Americans--and Nebraskans--lost to road crashes each year.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="87">H. Con. Res. 87</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
