  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the Democrat majority is going to bring the House budget resolution to the floor. Last month when they passed the budget resolution, it was the largest tax increase in American history. Today they are bringing a budget resolution to the floor that is slightly an improvement: It is the second largest tax increase in American history. And the only thing that is separating this budget from being the largest tax increase in American history is what they call  the "tax trigger," and under their tax trigger, if they actually get to spend all of the money they are hoping to spend, then the surpluses will not materialize and no taxes will be spared and it will yet again become the largest tax increase in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget is unprecedented in its scope of its ability to tax and spend. The highest levels of taxes we have ever seen in this country and the highest levels of spending. That is not a way to balance the budget and set our fiscal house in order. We should vote against this budget, which raises taxes and raises spending at unprecedented levels.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
