  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="TRIBUTE TO MONROE ROTARY CLUB">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the Monroe Rotary Club, which is celebrating its 90th anniversary this month, and I would like to take a few moments to publicly recognize their great history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rotary Club of Monroe was founded on April 29, 1918, with a membership of 31; however, they did not receive their charter until June of 1918. The stated purpose of the organization is to bring together business and professional leaders to provide humanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. In order to carry out its service programs, Rotary is structured in club, district, and international levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In furtherance of the goals of Rotary, the Rotary Club of Monroe has sponsored many local projects including, scholarships at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, Goodfellows, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Monroe Youth  Baseball, The Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, Camp Quality, The Salvation Army, and Girl's and Boy's State, to name a few. In addition they also sponsor Interact Clubs at Neville High School and River Oaks High School and sponsor two students  each year to attend District 6190's Camp RYLA--Rotary Youth Leadership Award, a program for young people intended to develop qualities of leadership, good citizenship, and personal development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year the members of the Rotary Club of Monroe also open their homes to members of the Rotary Foundation's Group Study Exchange program. They have proudly participated in this program for many years hosting teams from India, France, Norway, England, Brazil, Australia, Scotland, Belgium, Japan, Austria and several other countries. Additionally many of their members have traveled abroad as a part of the Friendship Exchange, where Rotarians seek opportunities to visit other districts throughout  the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I applaud the Rotary Club of Monroe on their 90th anniversary and thank them for their continued service to the state of Louisiana and the rest of the world.</paragraph>
