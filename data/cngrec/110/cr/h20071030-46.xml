    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3307">H.R. 3307</bill>, which names a postal facility in Bayonne, New Jersey, after Dennis P. Collins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3307">H.R. 3307</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Albio Sires on August 1, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20 of 2007 by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire New Jersey congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dennis P. Collins was a veteran of World War II and served in the U.S. Army for 3 years. In 1974, the people of Bayonne, recognizing Mr. Collins's abilities and his love for the community, elected him as mayor when Mayor Fitzpatrick decided not to run for another term. He was re-elected in 1978, 1982 and in 1986. He served for 16 consecutive years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, Mr. Collins retired as mayor, but remains active in public life. He received numerous awards and honors for his years of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Albio Sires, for introducing this legislation, and urge the swift passage of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to join my fellow Members of Congress in recognizing Dennis Collins and his extraordinary contributions to Bayonne, New Jersey. Fortunately for Bayonne, Mr. Collins missed his trip on the Titanic to visit family members back in Ireland. If it were not for this fortunate coincidence, the rest of Mr. Collins's biography most likely would not be possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Collins was born and raised in Bayonne, where he attended St. Vincent De Paul Grammar School and the Holy Family Academy. As a young man, he served in World War II, including time in the China-Burma-India theater of operations. Upon his return, he went to work for Tidewater Oil Company, General Motors, Edward F. Clark Real Estate and Insurance Agency, and Bayonne Water and Sewer Utility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately, it was his interest in the community that led Mr. Collins to seek political office. In 1962, Mr. Collins was elected to his first of three terms on the municipal council, two of which he served as council president. In 1974, he was elected to serve as mayor of the City of Bayonne. His popularity in the  community was so immense that he served for the next 16 years. He currently holds the record for Bayonne as the first individual to serve  seven consecutive 4-year terms in elective office and four consecutive 4-year terms as mayor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Collins retired in 1990 as mayor, but he continues to be an active and committed leader to the citizens of Bayonne.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Collins's reputation as a public servant was forged by his compassion and interest in helping his fellow citizens. His legacy and service to others is a wonderful example to his children, grandchildren and to the citizens of Bayonne and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With gratitude for his devotion and service to the Bayonne community, it is particularly fitting that we name the United States Postal Service building located at 570 Broadway in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3307">H.R. 3307</bill>, a bill to designate the post office on Broadway in Bayonne, New Jersey, as the Dennis P. Collins Post Office. Mayor Collins is a legend in my congressional district for his long-time public service to the people of his community and the State of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before entering elected public office, Mayor Collins served his country during World War II in the U.S. Army for 3 years, including time in the China-Burma and India theater of operations. In 1962, Mayor Collins won his first election to public life by serving on the Bayonne Municipal Council. He went on to serve two more terms, both as council president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1974, Dennis Collins ran and won his first term as the mayor of Bayonne. Mayor Collins served in his role as mayor of Bayonne for the next 16 years before retiring in 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though he no longer has an official position, Mayor Collins remains available to elected officials and citizens alike to advise and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former mayor in the same county as Mayor Collins, he served as a role model for me and many other mayors in the region. I always admired how Mayor Collins ran his city so efficiently, while never losing sight of the needs of his constituents. I see no better way to honor him today than by passing this bill to name this Bayonne Post Office after him so his legacy can continue in the city forever.</paragraph>
