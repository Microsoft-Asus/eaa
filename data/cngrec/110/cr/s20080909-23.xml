  <narrative>EXPANSION OF THE VERDE VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER -- (Senate - September 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8164">S8164</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to relate some good news from my State of Arizona. It is good news for Arizonans who live in the Verde Valley, which lies between Phoenix and Flagstaff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Verde Valley Medical Center, a 99-bed, full-service hospital, has recently completed a $35 million expansion project. The project, which took nearly 3 years to complete, increases the size of the facility and updates a portion of the existing space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The expansion and renovation will add new medical services and help the center serve patients more efficiently. For instance, the medical imaging department will be moved to a centralized location, and more beds will be added to the telemetry unit, which serves patients who need to be monitored, but do not require intensive care. The updated facility also includes improvements and additions to serve women and children. The perinatal unit will move to a new location with a C-section operating  room and a recovery room. The increase in the facility's size will also allow the creation of a pediatrics unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This recent project is only the latest expansion in the history of the Verde Valley Medical Center. For the past 70 years, the center has adapted to meet the needs of the growing community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The origins of the Verde Valley Medical Center can be traced to 1939, when a small, outpatient facility brought xray equipment and an operating room to Cottonwood. At that time, the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Clinic, as the center was then known, served a small, rural population. In 1940, Yavapai County, which contains Cottonwood, was home to just over 26,000 Arizonans. Today, the county has a population of over 167,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Verde Valley Medical Center has grown just like the region. Just 6 years after opening, the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Clinic added more beds and became a hospital. Two decades later, the hospital moved to its current location and opened a new 50-bed facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, in 1995, the medical center began extending its services into neighboring communities with the opening of a facility in Sedona. Later, new facilities would open in Camp Verde and Oak Creek. In 1998, the hospital became known as it is today, as the Verde Valley Medical Center, and 8 years later, the expansion project that has just been completed would begin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the opening of the expansion, Verde Valley Medical Center is ready to build on its record of serving the north-central Arizona community. During the 2008 fiscal year, the center served about 77,000 patients. This recent expansion will help to ensure that the medical center continues to meet the health care needs of Arizonans, just as it has for the past 70 years.</paragraph>
