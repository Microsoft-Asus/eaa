    <paragraph>Mr. President, during yesterday's discussion of the motion to proceed to the Water Resources Development Act, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator BOXER, inserted into the RECORD a chart that shows which Member or Members requested each project-related provision in the WRDA bill. This chart, of course, was our effort to comply with the intent of <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>, the Legislative Transparency bill. For some of the WRDA provisions, however, it was in  fact a particular Member who secured inclusion of the provision in the bill. Since the chart discloses each request, however, that distinction is not clear. With that in mid, I would like to provide the following list of provisions and the Members who secured them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the chart to which I referred be printed in the RECORD. </paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
