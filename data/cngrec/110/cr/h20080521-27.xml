    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, we celebrated National Teachers Day. That day represents one small token of our Nation's gratitude for the long hours and hard work our teachers endure to prepare our students for future endeavors. As a product of the Jefferson County, Colorado public schools, I can attest to the wonderful influence educators have had on my life, as well as on the lives of my three daughters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we as a Nation cannot thank enough our men and women currently serving in our public education system, such as my sister Cassie, for all that they do. I particularly want to take a moment to recognize the teachers in Adams, Arapahoe, and Jefferson County, Colorado, who enrich the education of our children and have a positive impact on our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to invest in our public schools and colleges and ensure our educators have the tools and resources they need to give our children the high quality education to succeed in this increasingly competitive economy. Our teachers are dedicated, valuable public servants whom we owe a sincere debt of gratitude.</paragraph>
