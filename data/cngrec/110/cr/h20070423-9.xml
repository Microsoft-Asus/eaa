    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Saturday a sad tragedy occurred during a Blue Angels air show at the Marine Corps Air Station at Beaufort, South Carolina. Toward the end of the show, Blue Angel No. 6, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Kevin Davis of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, crashed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Commander Davis did not survive. Fortunately, there were no other fatalities. Lieutenant Commander Davis was a decorated pilot who joined the Blue Angels in 2005. He served in the Navy for 11 years, 8 of them as a fighter pilot. He flew 26 combat missions in Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism. Lieutenant Commander Davis's parents, John and Ann Davis, are residents of Aiken, South Carolina. He has two brothers, Christian and Phil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Blue Angels are an elite team of fighter pilots to fly F/A-18s in air shows around the country. Because of their high skill level, their courage and intense practices, accidents such as this Saturday's are uncommon. The thoughts and prayers of my wife, Roxanne, and I are with the Davis family. Americans will always cherish the service of Lieutenant Commander Kevin Davis for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
