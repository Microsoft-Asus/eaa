  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to wish happy birthday to America's Vancouver, Vancouver, Washington. I rise in honor of the 150th birthday of Vancouver, Washington. As we say back home, Vancouver not B.C., Washington not D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a place up north that was not founded until 29 years later, so we were the first. America's Vancouver was the first incorporated city in what is now Washington State. It hosts its proud heritage with the Vancouver National Historic Reserve. Fort Vancouver, Pearson Field, the site of the first transpolar aviation landing, a host of historic achievements and wonders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would invite everyone to join us in America's Vancouver on July 7 of this year as we officially celebrate America's Vancouver's 150th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include for the RECORD an article from the Columbian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Happy 150th!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the most-senior city in Washington state is ..... Seattle? The biggest city in the Northwest and hub of the state's economy, is a sad non-contender in the competition. It was incorporated in 1869.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Spokane? The Capital of the Inland Empire, as the second-largest city calls itself, is practically a newborn. It was incorporated in 1881 and just celebrated its 125th birthday anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walla Walla is older than that. It came into being in 1862.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Steilacoom (near Tacoma), now there's an old city: 1854.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was just one year after the oldest incorporated city in Washington, Columbia City ..... Ooops ..... Columbia City was the name as late as 1850, when it was recognized as more than just a military or fur-trapping post. But when it was incorporated seven years later, on Jan. 23, 1857, as the first city in what would become Washington state, it was Vancouver. Our Vancouver!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real newcomer is the other Vancouver, in Canada, eh? Incorporation: 1886. So, if nothing else, on Tuesday this week, when Vancouver USA officially turns 150, you might silently pledge to pay no attention the next time someone suggests, as someone always does, that we rename our city Fort Vancouver in order to avoid confusion with the bigger city to the north. We were here first. Let them rename their city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of the story of Vancouver USA's early years and most famous people is efficiently and colorfully told in words and photographs in a special section in today's Columbian, "Vancouver, Washington--150 Years in the Making." Frankly, it's a hoot. There's also an online slide show at columbian com/video.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mayor Royce Pollard, who always calls the state's oldest city "America's Vancouver," will deliver his State of the City Address on Tuesday, kicking off a year-long celebration. While acknowledging the past, the speech will fittingly look ahead. Pollard has titled his address, "Pride, Progress, Possibilities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The signature event of the 150th birthday will be on Saturday, July 7, at the Vancouver National Historic Reserve, which long-time residents still refer to as "The Barracks" and newer residents know as the place they have the big fireworks shows on the Fourth of July. The hope is to get country singer Willie Nelson out for the event. He was a disc jockey in the mid-'50s at the old KVAN radio station, 707 1/2  Main St.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a Columbian editorial on May 31, 1921, the writer was effusive about the county and the town, noting that it was the world's greatest prune producer, had "industrial possibilities second to no other city on the globe ..... has the finest water in (the) state" and that its "beautiful homes (and) wide streets elicit wonder from its visitors ....."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such boosterism brings a snicker today, but you gotta love the spirit behind it and  wish for more like it in this, Vancouver's 150th year.</paragraph>
