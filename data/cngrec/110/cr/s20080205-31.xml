  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - February 05, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="657">S657</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="CORPORAL DUNCAN C. CROOKSTON">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of CPL Duncan Crookston, who died recently at Brook Army Medial Center in Texas from wounds he sustained when a roadside blast tore through his humvee on September 4, 2007. The attack killed three other soldiers in his vehicle. When he died on January 25, Duncan was 1 day shy of his 20th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Crookston's friends and family gathered at Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver on Saturday to share their memories of a young man of extraordinary energy and talent who chose to devote himself to the service of his country. His fellow soldiers say he chose the Army knowing the dangers and accepting the possibility of losing his life. He did his job and "he met his calling," one soldier said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Duncan joined the Army shortly after graduating from Denver West High School. With his standardized test scores, any university in the country would have been lucky to have him, but he was committed to doing right by his Nation and by those with whom he served. In the Army, it became immediately clear that he had a mind for engineering and electronics, so he became the radio-tech operator in his unit. He could fix almost anything, and in the toughest conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For almost 5 months after the Baghdad blast, Corporal Crookston hung on. His wife Meaghun and his mother Lee stayed by his side at Brook Army Medical Center, helping him in his fight for recovery. His wounds, though, were simply too grave. He had burns over 50 percent of his body, lost both of his legs, his right arm, and his left hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was no limit, it seems, to Corporal Crookston's courage. On a mission, he always wanted to be out front. In the hospital, he fought the odds to the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Crookston's courage is all the more admirable for the fact that he applied it in service to his country, fulfilling his duty with honor. "You will never do anything in this world without courage," the Greek philosopher Aristotle once wrote. "It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to imagine a more powerful example of courage than that which Duncan Crookston and his family demonstrated over the last few months of his life. There are no words that can capture the pain or grief they must have endured as they battled for his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To his wife Meaghun, to his father Christopher, to his mother Lee, and to  his five brothers, our thoughts and prayers are with you. You have made a sacrifice that a grateful Nation can never repay. I hope that one day your sorrow will salved by your pride in knowing that Duncan served the Nation with overwhelming honor, courage, and dignity. He will never be forgotten.</paragraph>
