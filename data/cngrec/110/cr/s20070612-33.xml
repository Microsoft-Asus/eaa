  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg, and I wish to recognize the considerable achievements of Claira Monier, a Goffstown resident who recently announced her retirement after leading the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority for nearly two decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Claira is a gold standard public servant. A New Hampshire native, she has devoted her life to improving her community, State and Nation. Moreover, in what limited spare time she has, Claira is someone to whom Senator Gregg and I can turn for steady counsel on policy--housing tax credits, bond caps, affordable housing--and politics. She is a rare and irreplaceable friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether in the classroom or leading efforts to expand access to housing or health care, Claira has demonstrated the highest commitment to service over a 40-year period. Although her record of achievement is well-known in New Hampshire, it is worth repeating here on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1967 to 1974, she held teaching and administrative positions at New Hampshire College and St. Anselm College. Claira subsequently served for 5 years as the director of the New Hampshire State Council on Aging, completing her tenure in 1981.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having demonstrated uncommon competence and creativity in these roles, Claira was selected as Region I Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In 1988, she began her legendary career as executive director of the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority--an organization on which she has left an indelible mark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While working by day to support affordable housing and home ownership initiatives in New Hampshire, Claira managed to simultaneously bring her leadership skills to a number of nonprofit boards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She served as a Director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston from 1990 to 1992 and was a member of its Affordable Housing Advisory Council. She also found time to serve for 2 years as chairman of then-Governor Gregg's Commission on Health Care Costs and Availability, leaving the panel in 1991. Claira was board president of the National Council of State Housing Agencies and served as cochair of the Fannie Mae Housing Impact Advisory Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list goes on: past chair of the Manchester Red Cross; former Southern New Hampshire University trustee; 2003 chair of the Heritage United Way Campaign; former chair of the New Hampshire Main Street Center; chair of New Hampshire's chapter of the American Lung Association; chair of the West High School endowment fund; member of the Dartmouth Hitchcock Healthcare System's assembly of overseers; and so on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not exactly clear when, or if, Claira had time to sleep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this much is known: Claira is one of those special people who looks at her community and is able to see how she can make it better. She is not prone to idle thoughts. Rather than stand on the sidelines saying how the order of the world should be, Claira enters the arena with vigor and inspires people to achieve difficult objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The results of her work can be seen across New Hampshire. For first-time homeowners in our State--or those who thought they might never be able to own a place of their own--it is likely that Claira's leadership at New Hampshire Housing had something to do with their securing a piece of the American dream. It is difficult to imagine work that is more hopeful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that Claira leaves behind a rich legacy at New Hampshire Housing. Her successors, no doubt, share her commitment to that organization's mission and will continue the important work she has started. It should be noted, though,  that Senator Gregg and I will certainly miss working with her on critical issues that impact so many New Hampshire residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Claira may be retiring from her day job but in no way is she retiring from her community. Her knowledge of New Hampshire, her warm demeanor, and her strong leadership will continue to benefit the organizations she supports. Additionally, candidates--notably those seeking the highest office in the land--will turn to Claira for advice and counsel that only she can provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Claira is a good, true and loyal friend. A great citizen of New Hampshire, Senator Gregg and I extend our warm regards to Claira on the occasion of her retirement. We look forward to seeing her in the communities she has served and will serve.</paragraph>
