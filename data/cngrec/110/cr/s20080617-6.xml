  <narrative>UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 5749 -- (Senate - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5669">S5669</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my distinguished friend, the Senator from the State of Arizona, is here. As a result, I am going to propound a unanimous-consent request so as not to cause him to have to spend any time here he would not ordinarily have to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has passed an unemployment compensation bill. I am going to show the Senate in a little while that we are at 76 filibusters. I am not going to go through another one on unemployment compensation. If we do not agree to pass this bill at this time, there will not be a long floor debate on unemployment compensation. What we will do, it is my understanding this legislation will be in the supplemental we will get from the House. That being the case, we will have ample time to talk about  the issue if anybody wants to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished majority whip is going to speak on unemployment compensation, as are some others today. But right now I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 780, <bill type="h" number="5749">H.R. 5749</bill>, a bill we recently received from the House, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act. I ask that the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do object. I wonder if I may make one brief comment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to make the point that when we do extend unemployment benefits, if we do, the Senate needs to weigh in on its ideas about how it ought to be done, for one thing. The House-passed bill, which I don't think we want to consider, eliminates the 20-week work requirement which has been the law now since 1981. So theoretically someone could work a very short period of time and be entitled to this 13-week extension, something I don't think we want to change. As a result,  we would like the Senate to weigh in and get it done the right way. For that reason, I have to object to bringing the House bill up at this time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will be willing now to accept that change in the legislation and pass it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I might further address the majority leader  then, I have several concerns. I highlighted one.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, this, I believe, will be in the package we get from the House, and we will be happy to work with the minority if they feel some changes should be made. There are a number of people on my side who would agree to this, and maybe there are other points on which we can agree.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. I think there are some issues the Senate wishes to modify in the proposal. The offer to work together is a fair one, and that is how we ought to proceed.</paragraph>
