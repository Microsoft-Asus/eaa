    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are plenty of challenging news stories about the economy, and we in upstate South Carolina have had some of those experiences ourselves. It is worth celebrating some of the successes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 10, BMW announced an additional $750 million expenditure at their Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant, bringing their total investment to $4.2 billion. They will add 500 employees to the 6,300 already there and 1,500 employee jobs will be added among the suppliers. Those suppliers, by the way, have invested $2.1 billion in South Carolina and have 12,000 employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very exciting to have this kind of news. It is also exciting to see the technology that BMW plans to employ in Spartanburg. They are going to bring clean diesel for the first time to the United States. It is going to be in the brand new X-6, all of which will be made in Spartanburg, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That car will also get 30 miles per gallon. Frank-Peter Arndt, their board member, explained that even at 125 miles an hour on the autobahn, the X-6 with the deep clean diesel will get 30 miles per gallon. It is a wonderful success worth celebrating.</paragraph>
