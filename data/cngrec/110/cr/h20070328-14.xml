  <speaking speaker="412205" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to one of my distinguished predecessors in representing the district I am now privileged to serve in Congress and to celebrate his recent 80th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. John Brademas served the then-Third District of Indiana in the House of Representatives for 22 years, from 1959 until 1981. While in Congress, Dr. Brademas played a leading role in writing most of Federal legislation enacted concerning schools, colleges and universities, services for the elderly and the disabled, libraries, museums, the arts and humanities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his last 4 years on Capitol Hill, John Brademas served as House majority whip under Speaker Tip O'Neill. Our distinguished former colleague was a dedicated and highly effective legislator and shaper of national policy. He has also been president of the Nation's largest private university, New York University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, many Members of both this Chamber and the Senate on both sides of the aisle served with Dr. Brademas. I believe they will share my sentiments in expressing our admiration for his outstanding public service and join me in wishing him well.</paragraph>
