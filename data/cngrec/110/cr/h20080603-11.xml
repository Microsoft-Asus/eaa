    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the weekend I had the opportunity to visit three schools in my congressional district, and I want to take the opportunity to commend and congratulate all three of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Walter Lutheran High School in Melrose Park, Illinois, where I attended their graduation Sunday, and I was pleased that my nephew Dante Davis was one of the graduates; then the Austin Polytechnical High School, which focuses on manufacturing, in Chicago yesterday; and last night I had a town hall meeting at the Richard T. Crane High School in Chicago on stopping school violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of them are outstanding, and I commend them.</paragraph>
