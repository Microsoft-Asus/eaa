  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas African American men and women have served with distinction, courage, and honor in the United States Armed Forces throughout the history of the nation, even when they were denied the basic constitutional freedoms promised to all citizens;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the practice of racial segregation and discrimination in the military prevented African Americans from receiving the full recognition to which they were entitled as a result of their service;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas African Americans, in leading the effort to protest discriminatory treatment in the armed forces, paved the way for successful integration of women, Asians, Hispanics, and other ethnic minorities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the dedicated and heroic service of African American men and women during World War II led to President Truman's historic executive order 60 years ago that marked the beginning of racial integration in the United States Armed Forces; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas as a result of President Truman's action, the United States Armed Forces has become one of the nation's best examples of an institution committed to equality, opportunity, and advancement based on merit rather than race, religion, or ethnicity; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the heroic contributions of each member of the United States Armed Forces should be honored and celebrated: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this concurrent resolution provides for the use of the Capitol rotunda to mark the 60th anniversary of the integration of the United States Armed Forces. I support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago, President Harry Truman issued Executive Order 9981, which established the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces. Determined to end segregation in the Armed Forces, President Truman issued this historic directive to end discrimination experienced by African American soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Executive Order 9981 was successful in ending racial segregation in the military and its effect is long-standing. As a result of the directive, segregation based on creed, gender, and national origin was also abolished. It is important we recognize such an historic victory for civil rights and for our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while we wait to find out what we are going to do tomorrow and whether there will be a real energy bill presented to this floor, or some more energy fluff, I do rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="377">H. Con. Res. 377</bill> which would authorize use of the rotunda of the Capitol to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the integration of the United States Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981, which provided for the equal treatment of blacks serving in the military. We should remember that previous attempts had been made to integrate the Armed Forces. In fact, during our Revolutionary War, approximately 5,000 African Americans served in integrated units. They served in many different capacities, including as artillerymen infantrymen, laborers, and even entertainers. Each served our Nation proudly, protecting the  freedoms that they themselves had not yet come to know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With a new century, though, came political realities that would once again segregated the military. Nearly 50 years passed until once again blacks and whites were able to stand shoulder to shoulder, as a unit defined not by color, but by a commitment to freedom and love of country. President Truman's executive order to integrate the military also laid the groundwork for other minorities to gain those same rights, paving the way for the diverse group of men and women of all backgrounds who today  serve in our military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="hc" number="377">H. Con. Res. 377</bill>, so we may mark the historic occasion of the integration of our Nation's Armed Forces with a ceremony here in our Nation's capital at the Capitol rotunda in a manner that would truly honor the sacrifice that men and women of all backgrounds have made to our Nation throughout history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand the gentlelady has no further speakers, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I just urge that Members support <bill type="hc" number="377">H. Con. Res. 377</bill> which provides for use of the Capitol rotunda marking the 60th anniversary of the integration of the United States Armed Forces.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="377">H. Con. Res. 377</bill> to authorize the use of the rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony commemorating the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the integration of the United States Armed Forces. The historic document that began the process of integration was Executive Order 9981 issued by President Harry S. Truman, my fellow Missourian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History has well documented that President Truman was a man of great principle and courage. He was by all accounts a man that did not shrink from responsibility even when the decisions were very difficult. The employment of atomic weapons at the end of World War II, the Berlin airlift at the beginning of the cold war, and the Korean war are but few examples of his leadership during crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I believe it is his decision to declare that each person in the military is deserving of equal treatment and opportunity, regardless of race, color, religion, and national origin that most reflects his personal commitment to his core beliefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His July 26, 1948 Executive order was no weak-kneed statement designed to fit the political expediency of the era. Executive Order 9981 was a bold statement that reflected his heartfelt commitment to the civil rights of all Americans and the American style of freedom that became a beacon of hope for so many people throughout the world during World War II. This powerful statement of equality in treatment and opportunity reflects the highest standards of democracy and lived up to the American spirit  that we all cherish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Truman saw much in the professional and heroic performance of African Americans during World War II that demanded he issue his Executive order. The exploits of African Americans that carried out the Red Ball Express, flew with the 99th fighter squadron, and served as Tuskegee Airmen are legendary. There were also stories of the many individual heroes during World War II like the seven African Americans who were finally awarded the Medal of Honor for their long-overlooked World War II  heroism in 1997. Like all the other wars that preceded World War II, African Americans had played an important role during war and Harry Truman was determined to set the record straight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 60th anniversary of President Truman's Executive order to begin the integration of the Armed Forces is a pivotal event in United States history that is deserving of a ceremony in the rotunda of the Capitol. I thank Chairman Brady and the staff of the House Administration Committee for helping to move this resolution so expeditiously and I strongly encourage my colleagues to support <bill type="hc" number="377">H. Con. Res. 377</bill>.</paragraph>
