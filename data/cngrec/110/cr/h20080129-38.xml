  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO THE LATE MARGARET TRUMAN DANIEL -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H537]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to rise to follow up on the announcement that my good friend Mr. Skelton from Missouri just made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, all Missourians are proud of President Truman and his family. He was a man of great humility. In fact, one day recently in Washington I happened to be driving by, on Connecticut Avenue, the small apartment that he and Margaret and Mrs. Truman lived in when he was Vice President and for I think the first 3 days of his Presidency. Not the grandeur that anybody would expect, but something that the Trumans, a family who actually never lived in a house that they owned for most of Margaret  Truman's life, appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was just sharing with Mr. Skelton the memory of Margaret Truman when we recommissioned the Battleship Missouri when it went back into active duty in 1985 or 1986, and I had the honor at the recommissioning dinner in San Francisco to introduce Margaret Truman, who had been the principal sponsor of the ship the first time when her father was in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By that point in the evening, about every speaker had pronounced the name of our State differently. Some said "Missouri," some said "Missoura," and I made a couple of comments about that. And Margaret Truman got up and she said, "It is `Missoura.' My father always said `Missoura.' My family always said `Missoura.' I was there when this ship was commissioned. We commissioned it the `Battleship Missoura,' and that should settle it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But she was a lady that led an interesting life, the truly adored daughter of her father, and she saw politics the way that very few people do. I appreciate her life and her family.</paragraph>
