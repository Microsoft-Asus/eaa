  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me express my deep concern for the three soldiers who are now missing in Iraq and applaud their brothers-in-arms for never giving up on their search, for we as Americans will never leave our comrades, our brothers and sisters, in battle or never leave them on the battlefield. That is why this Congress, with the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, believes that we can craft a resolution and a solution, and that is that we begin to redeploy our troops  and focus on the Iraqi Government, to have them stand up and to have them ensure the safety of the Iraqi people and also Americans to ensure the safety of their soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our soldiers have been successful on the battlefield. They can claim victory. It is time now for the President, the White House, the leadership to get together and to be able to solve these untenable problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we allowing our young people to be on the battlefield without the support, the full support, of a reasoned White House? Let us work together.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
