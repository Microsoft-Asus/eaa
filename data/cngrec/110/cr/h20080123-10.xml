    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Children's Health Insurance Program, and hope that we would override the President's veto today. This will cover 3.4 million uninsured children. The number is almost too large to comprehend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity to live in an oncology ward several years ago with my young daughter. There was a young boy, 2 1/2  years old, with acute leukemia, who had to listen, or, rather, his parents were listening, as social workers came and went to see if he could potentially be covered, because they did not have health insurance, covered to receive the care my daughter was receiving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we enter what is possibly a recession, I see that number growing. This is something not morally right for these children. It is also a necessity for our economic betterment, to have healthy, productive individuals. I urge my colleagues all to vote to override the President's veto, for this Nation and for our children.</paragraph>
