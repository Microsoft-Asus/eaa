    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of <bill type="s" number="2216">S. 2216</bill>, a bill to extend the Indian Employment Credit Depreciation Rules for property within an Indian reservation, and that the bill be read a third time and passed. I further ask that the bill then be held at the desk until the House companion arrives and that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate-passed bill be inserted, and the House bill, as amended, be  read a third time and passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is one of those I just referred to on the floor of this body.</paragraph>
