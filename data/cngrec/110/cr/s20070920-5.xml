  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, following any time Senator McConnell and I may use, the Senate will conduct a period of morning business until 10:30. We need to start at that time. There is so much left on the Defense authorization bill. The time in morning business is equally divided and controlled between the two sides; the majority will control the first portion. Following that, the Senate will resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill with debate  continuing on the Cornyn amendment.</paragraph>
