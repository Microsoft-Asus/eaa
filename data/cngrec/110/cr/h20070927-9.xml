    <paragraph>Earlier this week, the world came together at the United Nations to discuss the need to take action against climate change. The United Nations Secretary General stated, "I am convinced that climate change and what we do about it will define us, our era, and ultimately the global legacy we leave for our future generations." Missing from the discussion, however, was none other than the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than engage, the Bush administration continues to bury its head in the sand, organizing summits to discuss aspirational goals and ignoring real science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The science is certain. Human activity impacts human security, and without a mandatory agreement, the costs of climate change will continue to be socialized. Business as usual cannot go on. We must commit to mandatory reductions in order to protect health, environment, and security around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our cities, States, and Democrats in Congress are leading by example. I hope the administration will join us and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Vulnerable communities in the United States and around the world deserve nothing less.</paragraph>
