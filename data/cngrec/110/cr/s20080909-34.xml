    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great sadness I rise to honor a great American, a great Arkansan and my friend. Bill Gwatney, a valiant public servant, was taken from us on August 13, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill was my friend for many years. This included his days as an elected official in Arkansas where he served as a State senator for 10 years. He was committed to improving the State of Arkansas by taking the lead on legislative redistricting, reforming ethics rules, and encouraging economic development throughout the State. While serving in the State senate he fought against insurance companies to pass the Any Willing Provider legislation. This allowed patients more flexibility in choosing their  doctors. He inspired other great leaders to lift the State and the country into a prosperous future. He worked tirelessly every day to make Arkansas a better place for his children and for children from the Delta to the Ozarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He became chair of our State party in 2007 and was a leader in getting the party to where it is today. His work ethic and ability to bring people together were unmatched. His personality was contagious, likable, and he was an all around wonderful person. In the days following his death, he was praised on both sides of the aisle. Bill was taken from us too soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I echo a comment by Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe who said: "Arkansas has lost a great son, and I have lost a great friend." These words ring true to any Arkansan who had the privilege of knowing him. He believed strongly in integrity and good leadership within the State of Arkansas. His death put in perspective what he believed, that public service is about people, and with his passing Arkansas has lost one of its finest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill leaves behind a wife Rebecca and children, Christian and Chase, along with two step-children, Zachary and Emily.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my collogues to join with me in paying tribute to the life of a great family man, business leader, and public servant, Mr. Bill Gwatney.</paragraph>
