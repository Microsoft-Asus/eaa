  <narrative>INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (Senate - February 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1150">S1150</bill>]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the previous order, the Senate resumes consideration of <bill type="s" number="1200">S. 1200</bill>, which the clerk will report by title.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A bill (<bill type="s" number="1200">S. 1200</bill>) to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to review and extend that act.</chair>
  <chair>Pending:</chair>
  <chair>Vitter amendment No. 3896 (to amendment No. 3899), to modify a section relating to limitation on use of funds appropriated to the Service.</chair>
  <chair>Dorgan amendment No. 3899, in the nature of a substitute.</chair>
  <chair>Smith amendment No. 3897 (to amendment No. 3899), to modify a provision relating to development of innovative approaches.</chair>
  <chair>Murkowski (for DeMint) amendment No. 4066 (to amendment No. 3899), of a perfecting nature.</chair>
  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe by previous unanimous cons ent the Senate will now consider the Vitter amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.</chair>
  <chair>The Senator from Louisiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this mainstream amendment. The Vitter amendment codifies the Hyde amendment and simply says in Indian health care no taxpayer funds will be used to support abortions, with the normal exceptions of the Hyde amendm ent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Up to now, this has been the practice and the law, but only because the Indian health care law points to whatever the current appropriations language is on the subject in Labor, Health, and Education. And so it is a very tenuous policy that is subject to change and a vote and a change in policy every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will solidify that policy. It will put the Hyde amendment in permanent Federal authorization law with regard to the Indian health care act, just as was done decades ago in the De fense authorization bill. It is a solid mainstream amendment, and I urge support from both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is not a debate about whether Federal dollars should be used for abortion services. Current law already prohibits that.  I oppose Federal funding for abortions, and I have supported the Hyde provision. But the Vitter amendment is completely unnecessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, we have a provision in the underlying bill that relates to the Hyde provision that applies to all other appropriations bills. But I do want to say this: This is not a mainstream amendment that everybody is clear about. In fact, there is a provision in this amendment on page 2, section B. I don't know what it means, and I don't think Senator Vitter knows w hat it means. There have been no hearings, no discussion, yet onward through the fog on amendments like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, we ought to have a hearing, but there has been no hearing. I don't understand what section B means, nor does the author, I believe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said all that, again, this is not a debate about whether Federal dollars should be used for abortion services. Current law already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortion services, and the underlying bill contains a provision that relat es to current law and continues the same policy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> All time has expired. The Senator from Louisiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will agree, provided I am allowed 30 additional seconds following Senator Vitter.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do this to ask t he distinguished Senator about the provision he is talking about. Maybe we can have a discussion about it rather than him vaguely alluding to it without pointing out the language and claiming nobody knows what it means.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. President, the appropriate place for that kind of discussion would have been a congressional hearing. That is where you discuss what provisions mean and how they are written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision reads: As to provide or pay any administrative  cost of any health benefits coverage that includes coverage of an abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't understand what that means with respect to facilities or other issues. There are a series of issues that relate to that. And that is not, incidentally, just codifying the Hyde amendment, as the Senator alleges. This provision doesn't exist with the Hyde amendment. This is something the Senator conceived of and added.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is, it ought to be the subject of a hearing. We don't disagree on the issue of Federal funding</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my remaining time, that was language I pointed out to the distinguished Senator 3 weeks ago when I introduced my amendment and we discussed it. So I think it is a little disingenuous to bring it up at this point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>And, Mr. President, he indicated when he pointed it out to me that this is why it was different than the Hyde amendme nt, which doesn't point to what he claims today.</paragraph>

  <chair>The Senator from Oregon.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Presiden t, 8 years ago, Congress asked the Indian Health Service and the tribes to revise a failed system for allocating facilities funding. The compromise they reached may amount to nothing without this amendment. That is why I feel so strongly about it. It is not only about one region or group of regions; this amendment is about holding true the government-to-government relationship the United States holds with all tribes. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment to ensure</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members should know it is unlikely that Native Americans in their States are receiving construction funding for Indian Health Service facilities. All this does is say to the Indian Health Service: Come up with a formula that is fair. Otherwise, your State, the tribes you represent, will receive nothing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Smith's amendment, No. 3897, to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, <bill type="s" number="1200">S. 1200</bill>, and urge my fellow Senators to vote against this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would expressly authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, to utilize a new "area distribution fund" methodology to allocate Indian Health Service, IHS, health care facilities construction, HCFC, funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This approach could resul t in critical projects that are on the current IHS HCFC priority list from receiving funding. These projects have been waiting for many years, and in some cases decades, to receive funding. Furthermore, section 301 of the underlying bill, which the Smith amendment would amend, represents the results of hours of bipartisan negotiations on this issue throughout the last 2 years. While I understand Senator Smith's desire to provide a possible avenue for his tribes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the IHS staff briefings, the entire concept of an area distribution fund does not guarantee that all IHS service areas receive HCFC funding; instead, it creates a new criterion that must be used to determine IHS HCFC funding priorities. The current criteria utilized by IHS are focused on directing funding to the IHS areas in most need, where IHS patients are most isolated and least likely to have access to care. This  geographic criterion does not represent good policy but simply</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that Navajo Nation also strongly opposes this amendment. Th e following discussion provides a summary of their concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I. CONGRESS SHOULD LEAVE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF SECTION 301 AS CONTAINED WITHIN <bill type="h" number="1328">H.R. 1328</bill> AND <bill type="s" number="1200">S. 1200</bill> UNCHANGED</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current language of section 301 "grandfathers" in those health facility projects that have completed phase one and two of the current health care facilities construction priority system, and places them on the construction priority list upon enactment of the Indian Health</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The following projects have completed phase one and two of the current health facilities construction funding process: Winslow Dilkon, AZ, Pueblo Pintado, NM, Bodaway-Coppermine, AZ, Gallup Indian Medical Center, NM, Alamo, NM, Albuquerque, NM, Ft. Yuma, AZ, Rapid City, SD, Sells, AZ, Crown Point, NM, and Shiprock, NM. These projects should not be penalized for following the rules by eliminating the old process and instituting a new ill-defined funding system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Conference Report for <bill type="h" number="2466">H.R. 2466</bill>, the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill, the managers recognized the need for a "base funding amount" for facilities: "Given  the extreme need for new and replacement hospitals and clinics, there should be a base funding amount, which serves as a minimum annual amount in the budget request." Unfortunately, the managers' intent was never fulfilled, and funding levels have dropped consistently for several years. Congressional funding</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the limited amount of funding, tribes are now competin g over an ever-decreasing pool of money for tribal health facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of the health facility projects on the current priority list have been in the planning process for 20 to 30 years. These projects have done all that is asked of them including adapting to any new requirements imposed on them midway through the planning process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current health  facilities construction priority system prioritizes projects based on several relevant factors such as volume of services provided; square footage needs; size; age; condition of existing facilities; demographics; population density; isolation; and distance to inpatient, outpatient, and alternative facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current priority system favors providing health facility construction dollars to those facilities that will provide a large volume of services over 10 years. For example, if a facility will ser ve 90,000 patient visits a year, calculated over 10 years, then this amount would total 900,000 patient visits in a 10 year period. The current system favors providing a volume of services that provides the most access to health care by the largest pool of people and need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, any system that distributes funding based upon equal distribution among the Indian health care regions could not provide a sufficient volume of services because some regions have larger native populations with less  access to health care than others. In other words, fewer people would be provided health care by more facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping the current priority system would provide certainty and reinforce the work put into developing existing health facility projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is currently no consensus as to the meaning or impact of an area distribution fund. In fact, the Federal Appropriation Advisory Board, the workgroup cr eated by the IHS to evaluate various facilities construction funding schemes, did not define the area  distribution fund. It is at best only a concept without a set methodology, structure, or any idea of what effects such a change may have on the current funding system. Randall Gardner, Acting Director</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some groups have argued that their IHS service areas have not received much needed health facilit y funding. However, the statistics, when weighed against isolated areas like Sells and the Navajo Nation, do not support the need for another hospital in, for example, the Portland, California, Bemidji, or Nashville service areas. According to the IHS, the Portland area has 218 hospitals providing health services to 157,000 tribal members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The California, Bemidji, and Nashville areas are similarly situated with respect to health care. In fiscal year 2001, California tribal health programs had 119,362 r egistered users with 69,238 active users served by 438 hospitals. The Bemidji area comprising Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, is made up of 34 tribes with 90,000 individual patients served by 494 hospitals. Finally, the Nashville area, which is the largest service area, has a native population of 45,000 Indian people with access</paragraph>
    <paragraph> However, the Navajo Nation area, which is as large as West Virginia, has 238,515 users living on, or near, the reservation with access to only 6 hos pitals. That is 1 hospital for every 39,753 users. The need for more health care facilities within the Navajo Nation area is clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Further, IHS statistics show that while the Portland, California, Bemidji, or Nashville service areas have not received any health facility construction dollars, the native people in these areas have always had access to superior health care. All Native Americans living within IHS areas also do not receive health facility dollars receive contract health care dollars that c over expenses incurred at non-IHS facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The current priority system rewards basic health care access over building redundant hospitals in areas with many non-IHS facilities that can provide much needed health care services. Building another hospital in the Portland, California, Bemidji, or Nashville service areas when the Navajo Nation and other IHS area have significant unmet needs is redundant and inefficient use of federal funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> VI. CONCLUSION</paragraph>
    <paragraph> The current HCFC system now provides funding to ensure that large populations without access to nearby hospitals receive health care facilities funding. The area distribution fund concept has yet to be established with any certainty as to its meaning or impact. A new ill-defined system should not replace the existing priority system without some study. Authorizing such a concept without investigating thoroughly the overall effect of such a dramatic change to how IHS health care facilities fund ed</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in strong support of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Today has been a long time in coming. I want to particularly recognize the work of my friend Senator Dorgan, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. We would not be here today without his d edication and persistence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report on the Native American health care system. One item in the report struck a very somber note with me. The report notes that as early as 1926 the adequacy of the delivery of health care to Native American was formally questioned by the government. In response, a report was issued 2 years later that sparked a host of statements by the Federal Government that the health status of Native Americans was "intolerable."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U nfortunately, the Commission notes that much of the 1928 report remains true today. It is indeed sad that in the 21st century Native Americans still do not have the access to and quality of health care to which they are entitled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague from North Dakota has so poignantly illustrated time and time again, there is a health care crisis in Indian country. Native Americans are 200 percent more likely to die from diabetes, 500 percent more likely to die from tuberculosis, 550 percent more likely to d ie from alcoholism, and 150 percent more likely to die from accidents. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for Native American adolescents, 2 1/2  times the national average. Native Americans have a life expectancy</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is unacceptable. And it is why it is so important that we pass the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 1.8 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives rely on the Indian Health Se rvice for health care. Since the act was first authorized in 1976, the ways in which health care is delivered in this country have changed enormously. The bill before us helps meet the contemporary needs of Indian country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the inability of many Indian people to receive preventive and nonemergency care is one of the reasons why there are such significant health disparities that exist between Native Americans and the rest of the U.S. population. In North Dakota, when the IHS clinic closes at</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also takes important steps to provide training and incentives to increase the number of health care professionals in Indian country, especially Native he alth care professionals who understand the unique conditions facing their own communities and can provide care with greater cultural awareness. At the University of North Dakota, three programs authorized by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act--the Quentin N. Burdick Indians Into Medicine, Indians Into Nursing, and Indians Into Psychology</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also includes much needed provisions to address the youth suicide crisis that exists throughout Indian country by authorizing grants to deliver more counseling and suicide prevention services to tribal communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am pleased my amendment to increase the use of video service delivery to assist in the outreach and enrollment of individual Indians in Medicare and Medicaid was incorporated into the managers'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not expect that we will be able to solve all of the health care challenges that exist in Indian country with this one bill, but I expect that we will be able to make substantial progress in addressing some of the most pressing needs and creat ing a stronger system for the future.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Se nate will pass the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2008. This bill would reauthorize and modernize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act which funds and authorizes health care services and programs to Native American Indians and Alaska Natives and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that we meet our treaty and legal obligation to provide these communities with access to quality health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act has been long overdue. The last time the Congress rea uthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act was in 1992, and this act has been up for reauthorization since 2001. The Indian Health Service has not been updated for far too long. As health care evolves and improves programs must be modernized to reflect new advances in the health care system. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has not been modernized since 1992, 16 years ago, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The disparities that exist between Indian communities and other Americans are overwhelming. The life expectancy for Indians is almost 6 years less than the rest of this country's population and the suicide rate is 2.5 times higher than the national average. Death due to alcoholism or tuberculosis is more than 600 percent more likely; and, Indians are 318 percent more likely to die from diabetes. These statistics are unacceptable and we need to continue to ensure that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of this bill brings us one step closer to ensuring that the Indian Health Service is adequately funded and that programs to address the health care needs of these communities are available.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to support final passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the Senate's work on this bill, I have been impressed with the bipartisan work that Senator Dorgan and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee have put into moving this bill forward. It was not any easy process, but I commend the committee for its ongoing dedication to significant consultation with Indian Coun try in drafting this bill and seeing it through to completion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are significant unmet needs in Indian Country throughout this Nation, and addressing the unmet health care needs ranks as one of the most significant problems that we must address. The Federal Government has a longstanding and well-established trust responsibility with regard to American Indian affairs, and this trust responsibility extends to providing good health care to communities throughout Indian Country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, the Fe deral Government has not lived up to its Federal trust responsibility commitments, but I hope that passage of this legislation will set the Federal Government on a course toward better supporting the needs of our American Indian communities, whether they be health care, education, or housing needs. While this bill is a vital step in the right direction, we need to follow through with fiscally responsible increased funding for the important programs authorized in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has the suppo rt of tribal governments throughout the United States, including the 11 tribes in my State of Wisconsin. I have heard from a number of constituents in Wisconsin about the need to pass this bill this year. The improvements that the legislation will make to various Indian Health Service programs including clinical programs on the various reservations throughout the State and urban Indian programs in Milwaukee and Green Bay are significant, and it is my hope that this bill</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health care is consistently the No. 1 issue that I hear about all over my home State of Wisconsin. When I hold my annual townhall meetings across the State, many people come to tell me about problems with our overall health care system, and data shows us that these problems are often most acutely felt in Indian Country. Lack of access to good health care is a problem that disproportionately affects American Indians throughout the United S tates. According to recent studies, American Indians and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may doubt whether this legislation is needed or whether it will really help improve the lives of Americans. The staggering statistics that highlight the health care disparities faced by American Indians show just how imperative it is that we pass this leg islation, which is long overdue. These statistics also help illustrate the vast  amount of work that remains to be done to improve the quality of health care in American Indian communities beyond</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reauthorization of this bill will help encourage health care providers to practice at facilities in Indian Country and encourage American Indians to enter the health care profession and serve their communities. Recruiting talented and dedicated professionals to serve in IHS facilities, whether urban or rural, is a key challenge facing many  tribal communities in Wisconsin and around the country. I hope these provisions will help bring additional dedicated doctors, nurses, and other health care</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also reauthorizes programs that assist urban Indian organizations with providing health care to American Indians living in urban centers around the country. The Urban Indian Health Program represents a tiny fraction of the Indian Health Services budget, but the small amount of resources given to the  urban programs provides critical health services to those Indians living in urban areas. Contrary to what some people may think, the majority of American Indians now live in urban areas</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of this movement to urban centers, Congress created the urban Indian program in the late 1970s to address the growing urban Indian population around the country. The Federal Government's responsibility to American Indians does not end simply because some American Indians left their ancestral lands and moved to urban locations--particularly when some of them had little choice in the matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this legislation takes important steps toward improving</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted for an amendment offered by Senators Smith and Cantwell that would permit, but not require, the Secretary of HHS to create an area distribution fund to allocate funding resources for IHS facilities construction to all 12 of the IHS service areas. I have heard a lot of concern from tribes in my State of Wisconsin about the way that construction facility funds are allocated and the fact tha t certain IHS service areas, including the Bemidji region covering Wisconsin, do</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also voted for amendment 4032, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, because it is critically important that sexual assault victims be able to find out</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Pr esident, Indian Country has made many compromises in order to move this bill forward, and passage of this bill is long overdue. The Senate's actions today mark an enormous victory for Indian Country, and I hope that the House will quickly take this bill up so that we can get this bill signed into law by the President this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes concrete and positive steps toward addressing some of the health care needs facing American Indian communities around the country, and I look forward to working w ith my colleagues to build on this legislation in the coming months and years. Challenges facing American Indians throughout the United States extend beyond health care issues into issues of improving economic development, educational opportunities, and affordable and safe housing opportunities, and I hope we can continue</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to take a few minu tes to talk about the vote we had earlier today on an amendment offered by Senator Vitter to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Senator Vitter described his amendment, which was adopted by the Senate, as codifying a longstanding policy that prohibits Federal funds from being used to pay for abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree that Federal funding should not be used to pay for abortions. I have always supported the existing funding prohibition known as the Hyde amendment that has been added in the approp riations process every year since 1976.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That being said, I opposed Senator Vitter's amendment because the amendment would only codify the Hyde amendment with respect to the Indian Health Service. I think we should apply the same standard to all Federal health programs and not set up a separate standard that only applies in Indian Country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the next vote will be a vote on final passage. I will take just 30 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say that Senator Murkowski has helped get us to this point in a very significant way. As to Senators BAUCUS, GRASSLEY, KENNEDY, ENZI, KYL--and especially Senator Reid, who allowed us to spend time on the floor on this bill--and the 31 cosponsors of the legislation, I thank all of them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate has taken an important step today by passing <bill type="s" number="1200">S. 1200</bill>, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am now pleased to join the other 30 cosponsors of this legislation in sending it to the  House for their consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When signed into law, this legislation will:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>increase and improve recruitment and retention programs for Indian health professionals;  improve communicable and infectious disease monitoring and provide for more research on issues unique to those living on reservations;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>improve and expand diabetes screening and treatment programs;  expand programs to prevent domestic violence, sexual abuse, and substance abuse, in Native American com munities;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>incorporate and encourage the use of technology in delivering health care services and  providing treatment, which is so important to our rural Indian communities;  and encourage States to increase outreach to Indians to help them to enroll in Medicaid and SCHIP programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by a broad, bipartisan coalition, those in Indian Country, and many organizations that advocate for eliminating disparities in health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportun ity to acknowledge the support and leadership of particular Senators and their staffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill managers have been strong and articulate advocates for the bill, and shown great flexibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator Dorgan and his staff, particularly Allison Binney, Cindy Darcy, Heidi Frechette and Ben Klein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator Murkowski and her staff, including David Mullon and Nathan Bergerbest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator Baucus, and his staff, particularly David Schwartz and Richard Litsey;  and Senator Grassley and his staff, including Rodney Whitlock, who have insisted on improvements in the administration of Indian health programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator Kennedy and his staff, particularly Caya Lewis, and Senator MIKE ENZI and his staff, including Randi Reid, Shana Christrup, Greg Dean and Amy Shank, who helped us negotiate many difficult issues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>She has served me, the Indian Affairs Committee, and the Senate very well. And most importantly, she has served the residents of Indian Country exceedingly well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank my colleagues, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, and his health policy advisor, Megan Hauck, and Senator JON KYL, and particularly Jennifer Romans, for th eir agreement and commitment to see that this bill finally received its due consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I want to acknowledge the support of the late Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. Before he passed away last year, his leadership on the Indian Affairs Committee was helpful in bringing the Senate to this moment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="NOT VOTING--7">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to recognize the passage of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I again thank the majority leader and minority leader</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for their commitment in considering this legislation, addressing the issues, and supporting our efforts to improve health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with many bills, the provisions fall  under more than one committee's jurisdiction. The Committee on Indian Affairs, on which I serve as the vice chairman, has shared this bill with the Finance and HELP Committees, and both of these committees have worked in earnest to assist us in crafting a bill to carry the Indian health care system into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am fortunate to have a chairman on the Indian Affairs Committee--Senator Dorgan--with whom I share a close working relationship. We both have significant populations of Native peop le in our States with similar issues and challenges in many areas such as health care, education, housing, economic development and transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had numerous opportunities to work together in our committee, particularly on youth suicide prevention and treatment and telemedicine. I truly appreciate his persistence and dedication in advancing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators Grassley and Baucus have also worked with us closely to advance this measure through the Finance Committee last y ear which reported the bill out favorably in both the 109th and 110th Congresses. I also wish to recognize their staff Rodney Whitlock, Becky Shipp, and David Schwartz, who worked so closely with the Indian Affairs staff on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, Senator ENZI, in his capacity as chairman and now as ranking member of the HELP committee--worked very diligently on this legislation to refine key pieces of the legislation during the 109th Congress and again this year. Greg Dean, Shana Christrup, Randi Rei d and Amy Shank devoted countless hours of work with the Indian Affairs Committee to work out issues, which I appreciate. I especially appreciate the leadership and commitment of Senator Kyl. He has one of the largest</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not forget that this bill reflects the work of our dear colleague and my predecessor, the late Senator Craig Thomas, who held the reins as vice chairman last year. He eagerly pursued efforts to improve health care services for all American Indian communities, including those in his home State of Wyoming on the Wind River Indian Reservation, and it is most fitting that we will honor his work with the passage of th is bill. I pointed out on the floor yesterday, in the 109th Congress, Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between Chairmen Campbell and McCain in the 108th and 109th Congresse s, there were 8 hearings on the reauthorization, including joint hearings with the HELP Committee and with the House Resources Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our efforts had also great help from my good friends Senators Stevens, Domenici, Smith, Cochran, Hatch, and Thune. These Senators have been long-time friends of our country's Native people, and I want to acknowledge their dedication in promoting American Indian and Alaska Native health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican staff of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs has w aited a long time for this day to come. David Mullon, the Republican staff director and chief counsel, and Rhonda Harjo, the deputy chief counsel, came to the committee during Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell's tenure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rhonda Harjo has been the lead Republican staff member of the committee for Indian Health Care Improvement Act reauthorization since 2003. Indian country takes pride in her devotion to the betterment of her Native people and I share that pride today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to acknowledge the effo rts of Jim Hall and Jon Murphy and two Alaskans who recently joined the committee--Gerald Moses and Megan Alvanna-Stimpfle--in preparing this bill for floor consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also acknowledge the tireless efforts over the past 8 years of the Indian tribal and health care leaders and advocates across the U.S. in helping develop the legislative proposal which served as the basis for this bill. In particular, the National Tribal Steering Committee, consisting of tribal leaders and Indian health representative s, brought together the diverse interests of over 560 tribes across the country to a consensus on this very important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is no small task and it was handled dutifully by the cochairs of the National Tribal Steering Committee, Chairman Buford Rolin of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Atmore, Alabama, Rachel Joseph, former Chairwoman of the Lone Pine Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, in Lone Pine, California, and staff, Kitty Marx from the National Indian Health Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three key Alaska Native leade rs played significant roles on the National Tribal Steering Committee: Sally Smith, the chairman of the National Indian Health Board and the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation; Don Kashevaroff, the president of the Seldovia Village Tribe and chair of the Tribal Self-Governance Advisory Committee; and Valerie Davidson from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. I appreciate their leadership and thoughtful consideration in the development of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of good work went into this bill a nd our efforts should not go in vain. I look forward to working with my House colleagues and getting this bill on to the President's desk for signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we had a brief opportunity to express our thanks to those who have worked so hard on the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Again, my sincere thanks and gratitude to C hairman Dorgan for all that he has done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good day for Indian country, for Alaska Natives who are just waking up back home right now. They are going to wake up to news that they have been waiting to hear for a good decade: that finally we have advanced the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We have taken that step. We recognize this is not the end-all and be-all in terms of providing for the health care needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives. We know we need to do more, and we are c hallenged to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked about the funding issue and how we must make that next step to make sure it is not just what we put in the authorization, but we back that up with the dollars for the programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a long way to go, but I think we have made a very significant step today. I am proud of the work of my colleagues today and those who came before us on this very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"EXXON VALDEZ" OILSPILL</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to take a few minut es this morning to talk about tomorrow because tomorrow the United States Supreme Court will hear the appeal of the ongoing litigation between ExxonMobil and commercial fishermen and other plaintiffs whose livelihoods were negatively impacted, devastated, in fact, by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oilspill. The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. on March 24, 1989. It spilled 11 million gallons of oil--this is about the same</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, the spill area is still affected some 19 years later. In 2001, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studied the shoreline of Prince William Sound for any re maining effects of the spill. Scientists reviewed 91 sites within Prince William Sound and found that 58 percent of these locations were still polluted by oil. Again, this is 19 years after the fact. Some estimates note that beaches and streams in this area are still polluted with over 25,000 gallons of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the fisheries in Prince William Sound were affected. The herring fishery in this area experienced a dramatic decrease in the years immediately after the 1989 spill. As of 2007, the herrin g fishery had not improved to the pre-1989 levels. Another example is what has happened with the value of the fisheries permits in this part of the State. In 1988, a fishing permit in Prince William Sound was worth $400,000. As of 2004, the value of each such permit was less than $70,000, a drop of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a class action jury trial held in Federal court in Anchorage, AK, in 1994. The plaintiffs at that time included over 30,000 commercial fishermen, among those whose livelihoods  were gravely affected by the disaster. The jury awarded $5 billion in punitive damages to the plaintiffs. This punitive damage award has been on repeated appeal by ExxonMobil since that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 22, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reduced the punitive damage award to $2.5 billion. In early 2007, ExxonMobil petitioned the Ninth Circuit for  a rehearing en banc. Within a few months, the Ninth Circuit denied  this petition and ExxonMobil appealed to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, in this intervening time period, with years and years of litigation bringing delay in resolution, we have had several thousand plaintiffs pass away</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to the limitations in admiralty law with respect to the recovery of compensatory damages, many Exxon Valdez plaintiffs were not able to recover the financial losses they sustaine d in the aftermath of this spill. So the punitive damages that are under consideration by the Supreme Court will provide them that level of compensation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the Supreme Court decided to hear this case, I joined with Senator Stevens and Representative Young in submitting an Alaska congressional delegation amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court. In that brief, we argue that the award of punitive damages in this case of reckless and wanton conduct by Exxon not only is permissible under the Clea n Water Act, but it is supported by Federal maritime law. Only punitive damages will provide those who were harmed--and who continue to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This litigation needs to end. Nineteen years is far too long for these plaintiffs to wait to be compensated for their loss of income. I am hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, and I, along with so many Alaskans, look for a final resolution to this great tragedy</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
