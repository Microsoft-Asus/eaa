    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Captain Adam Snyder of Fort Pierce, Florida, who passed away on December 5, 2007, from battle injuries suffered in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adam was 26 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Snyder belonged to the 101st Airborne Division, stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He was the fourth generation Snyder to proudly serve the United States military. Adam was serving his second tour in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adam was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, where one of his professors, John McVan, described Adam as "one of the best and brightest I've ever had."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adam's brilliance was not limited to his military career. He impressed whomever he encountered in all walks of life. Adam looked forward to returning home and pursuing his dream of acting. His modesty, bravery, and humanity are qualities rarely found in such great measure in one man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart but great pride that I stand here today in this sacred hall to honor Adam and his family. I want to thank Adam's family for giving America a hero who went to work every day defending his country so that we can enjoy liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adam, our Nation for all eternity will be in your debt for the ultimate sacrifice you have made.</paragraph>
