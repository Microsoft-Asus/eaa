    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is day 46; that is, 46 days so far that our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits and health care. That is $18.5 million a day not able to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has been done for months and the President has already agreed to sign it. Now, Veterans Day has come and gone and the Democratic leadership continues to delay this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am calling on the Speaker not to adjourn for Thanksgiving until this bill has been sent to the President. And I call on all Americans to contact their Representatives to tell the Democratic leadership to send a clean veterans appropriations bill to the President. How can we celebrate a holiday with our families knowing that there are benefits that our veterans don't have access to simply because of a leadership decision to hold our veterans funding hostage?</paragraph>
