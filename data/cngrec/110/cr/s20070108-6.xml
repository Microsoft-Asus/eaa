    <paragraph>Mr. President, I never had the opportunity to meet with Gerald Ford when he was President, but I did when he was Vice President. I was chairman of the National Lieutenant Governors Conference. This was during the height of the energy crisis, and we came to Washington. One of the pleasures was meeting with the Vice President in the White</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House. That was really a big deal for me, a young Lieutenant Governor from Nevada. And a week or so after having met with the Vice President, he sent a picture to my home, a picture of me and the Vice  President. That was really a significant event in the Reid family, but also my boy thought it was a significant event, and he took a crayon and marked all over that picture--my prized picture of my being in Washington, sitting with the Vice President. So  my wife and I labored for some time and worked to get the crayon off that picture. We did a pretty good job. I still have the picture, but you can see my boy's marking on that with his crayon. I wish I had the opportunity to talk to the Vice President about that. I am sure he would have laughed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Ford was a wonderful man. We all know he died the day after Christmas. He was 93 years old. There were celebrations, as there should have been, in the Capitol Rotunda, at the National Cathedral, the Ford Presidential Library in Grand Rapids, MI, and the Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, MI, where I had the opportunity to attend at the invitation of the former First Lady. The speeches were good. Former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld spoke, President Jimmy Carter spoke, a noted historian  spoke. It was really a quite moving event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard tales during the past couple weeks of Gerald Ford and the athlete he was. We have even read from Chevy Chase, who became famous literally making fun of Gerald Ford. He made fun of him because--he was a big man--coming out of an airplane once, he hit his head on the airplane door, and that was the beginning of Chevy Chase's career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, even though Chevy Chase became famous making fun of President Ford, we have never had a more athletic President than President Ford--All-Big Ten; he was a great, outstanding football player at the University of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress, he was outstanding. He was praised by people who served with him. He served for about 25 years in the Congress and became the Republican leader. He, of course, was Commander in Chief as President of the United States. But one of the things we have learned so directly during the last couple weeks is how great he was to his wife Betty. She, during the time of their real public presence, had breast cancer and had a bout with alcoholism, and she approached both in a very  strong, courageous way. The Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Springs is a place where people go to find that they are addicted and need help. But we have learned what a wonderful wife she was to President Ford and what a great First Lady she was to her entire country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard tributes from Senators, Governors, clergy, newsmen, and Presidents. They differed in tone and substance, but they all made the point of stressing one thing: Gerald Ford was, above all, a man of integrity, a man of honesty, and, ultimately, a role model for all of us who serve in Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He, of course, is the only man to become President who was never elected. Yet, time and time again, he proved himself the right man at the right time, healing the Nation after the scars of Watergate and moving our country forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Husband to his wife Betty, father to his beautiful children, Michael, John, Steven, and Susan, World War II veteran, star athlete, even an Eagle Scout--Gerald Ford was the core of what America is all about, a shining example of what we hold best in America. He took office at a dark time in our country's history and shepherded this Nation through the trials of Vietnam and Watergate, with a bipartisan spirit of reconciliation and grace, a shining example to us all. He reminded a wounded nation  of the honesty and decency of its leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we all hope when we pass on our friends and colleagues will look back and say we left the world a better place. With Gerald Ford, there is no doubt. This Government, this Nation, this world are better from Gerald Ford's life and service to our country, and for this the Senate honors his life today.</paragraph>
