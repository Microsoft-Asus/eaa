  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this morning on behalf of 47 million Americans who go to sleep every night knowing that tomorrow they may go broke solely because they cannot afford health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People without coverage often delay treatments they desperately require, and we are all paying the price, for early treatment saves lives and saves money. We saw that in Blacksburg, Virginia, and we see it every day in emergency rooms and in amputations due to diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a better way of doing things, a way to guarantee access to affordable care for all citizens. Let's build the largest insurance risk pool possible, 300 million strong. If you are a citizen, you are in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's openly disclose prices so we know the price of a pill before we swallow it. And let's be kind to those who are in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the President to extend the lifesaving SeniorCare drug program in Wisconsin, and please, please, please, do not veto the children's SCHIP health care program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a better way of doing things. Let's find it together, with no patient left behind.</paragraph>
