  <speaking speaker="412235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, being from Tennessee, the Volunteer State, I volunteered to visit the men and women in uniform in Iraq this past weekend. I wasn't disappointed. Our troops are well trained, well motivated, and successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my visit to Iraq, I visited Ramadi, which until just a few months ago was a killing field overrun by al Qaeda. For the past 4 years, the people of Ramadi were caught in a decision-making battle of which group, us or the extremists, offered them the best chance for a normal and free existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The insurgent extremists chose to win the local people over with the use of force, force against our American troops and against any local who did not support their radical agenda. Our troops, on the other hand, have reached out with friendship and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The local people, seeing the difference, have chosen to have their lives return to normal and live in freedom. Ramadi has gone from a city of death and destruction to one of rebuilding and hope. I was able to see it firsthand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost to the American family is just too great to allow any other outcome than success in the global war on terror. We must win this war to protect our American way of life, now and into the future.</paragraph>
