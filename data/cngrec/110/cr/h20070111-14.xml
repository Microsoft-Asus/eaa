  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we will fulfill an important promise to the American people by authorizing ethical embryonic stem cell research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of people across our Nation and around the world will be paying close attention as we affirm our commitment to finding cures for diseases that have touched all of us: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and many more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been truly touched by letters of hope from constituents and from organizations representing those suffering from illnesses that may eventually be cured through stem cell research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And our Nation's leading scientists are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to make the United States the world leader in this groundbreaking research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members of Congress, we are blessed with the opportunity to take such an important vote that will pave the way to saving lives. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="3">H.R. 3</bill> today and be part of this monumental effort.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
