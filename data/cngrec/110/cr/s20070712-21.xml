  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="SPECIALIST DUSTIN WORKMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army SPC Dustin Workman II of Greenwood, NE. Specialist Workman was killed on June 28 by an improvised explosive device in Baghdad. He was 19 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Workman graduated from Ashland-Greenwood High School in 2005. Faculty at Ashland-Greenwood remember his talent for writing and his love of books, though not necessarily the ones assigned to him, his skill in mechanical working, and most importantly, his hard work and commitment to finishing school. From the time he was a freshman at Ashland-Greenwood, Specialist Workman's teachers noticed a strong desire to serve in the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Workman enlisted with the Army and served with B Company, 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, based at Fort Carson, CO. We are proud of Specialist Workman's service to our country, as well as the thousands of other brave Americans serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Workman is survived by his parents Dustin and Valerie, younger brother Korey, and younger sister Krysta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SPC Dustin Workman II.</paragraph>
