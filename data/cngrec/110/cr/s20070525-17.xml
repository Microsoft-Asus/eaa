    <paragraph>Madam President, today I congratulate the Georgia Tech women's tennis team for winning the 2007 Women's NCAA Tennis Championship in Athens, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Georgia Tech women's tennis program celebrated its first NCAA title on May 22, 2007, with a 4-2 win over UCLA. The Yellow Jackets' win over UCLA marked its 21st straight match win, and they finished the season at 29-4.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate team members Amanda Craddock, Kristen Fowler, Whitney McCray, Amanda McDowell, Kirsti Miller, Tarryn Rudman, Alison Silverio, and Christy Striplin for their hard work and achievement. Additionally, I congratulate Alison Silverio on being named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. I further extend my thanks to the players' families and fans for continually supporting these outstanding young women throughout a long but  exciting tennis  season. The team's success, undoubtedly, would not have been possible without the leadership of head coach Bryan Shelton, assistant coach Mariel Verban, and volunteer assistant coach Robin Stephenson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations again to all of these young women for their accomplishment.</paragraph>
