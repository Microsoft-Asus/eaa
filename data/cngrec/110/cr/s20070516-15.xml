    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that on May 15 I was unable to vote on certain provisions of <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. I wish to address these votes, so that the people of the great State of Kansas, who elected me to serve them as U.S. Senator, may know my position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding vote No. 163, on amendment No. 1090, I would not have voted in favor of this amendment. My vote would not have altered the final result of this vote.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I missed today's votes on Iraq because I was attending the college graduation of my daughter, Elizabeth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to express my unqualified support for the amendment offered by my colleagues, Senator FEINGOLD and Senator REID. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment says that our entanglement in another country's civil war has gone on long enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment says that Congress must stop playing the role of spectator and start standing up for our over-taxed and inadequately protected troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment says we must stand up for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment says that we have an obligation to support our men and women in uniform, not only by funding them, but by bringing them home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funding for our troops is assured, whether they are deployed in Iraq or redeployed from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment calls for their redeployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who claim this amendment would cut off funding for our troops are actually saying that the President, if required to redeploy our troops, would instead cut off their funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I may not see eye to eye with our President, but I don't believe him capable of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Feingold-Reid amendment says "enough is enough."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A majority of Americans want our troops to come home. It is time to bring them home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator FEINGOLD and Leader REID for having the conviction and the courage to stand up for our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patriotism is not passive. It is not swayed by inflammatory rhetoric or false accusations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the case of Iraq, patriotism does not mean blindly following the current path, it means carving out the right one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bringing our troops home is an act of patriotism. The Feingold-Reid amendment is an act of patriotism, and I fully support its intent.</paragraph>
