    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="42">H. Con. Res. 42</bill>, which honors the heroic service of glider pilots of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. I would like to commend the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) for bringing this measure forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution recognizes the more than 20,000 individuals who volunteered and were trained to serve as glider pilots during World War II. These brave men served alongside airborne forces and participated in many of the major invasions: Sicily, Burma, the Battle of Normandy, France, Holland, Germany, the Philippines, and the Battle of the Bulge. These unarmed gliders landed behind enemy lines transporting vital troops and equipment to support the Allied Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major General Henry "Hap" Arnold, commanding general of the Army Air Corps, directed the development of a transport glider program, and the United States military glider program officially began on February 25, 1941. These gliders provided the Army Air Corps with a unique ability to transport soldiers and equipment that could not be reached by conventional ground units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the end of 1942, the Army Air Force had graduated a total of 9,802 glider pilots. Within just 3 years, the United States had 21,240 military glider pilots available, according to the Army Air Forces Statistical Digest of World War II. Less than 3 years after the first graduating class of glider pilots had finished their training, these fearless pilots flew numerous combat teams into France on D-Day. Gliders transported 12 to 15 fully equipped soldiers and four portable machine guns with 500  rounds of ammunition for each gun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the American military glider pilots are a vanishing breed. The Department of Defense ended the military glider program in 1952. Today, we are here to honor these daring and fearless World War II glider pilots for their services and sacrifices and to urge all Americans to remember the significant contribution that they made on behalf of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 42, a bill to honor a  group of servicemembers who are oftentimes forgotten, the glider pilots of the United States Army Air Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Army Air Force began training glider pilots in 1942. These exceptional men provided an innovative and silent method of transporting troops and equipment in unarmed gliders during World War II, built of fragile balsa wood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the son of a member of the Fourteenth Air Force during World War II who served with the Flying Tigers in China, I especially appreciate the courageous airmen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The glider pilots, along with airborne forces, participated in eight successful missions, landing behind enemy lines in their unarmed gliders in Sicily, Normandy, southern France, Holland, Bastogne, Rhine Crossing, Luzon in the Philippines, and Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>During Operation Husky, which took place in Sicily on July 9, 1943, glider pilots carried British airborne troops, completing their mission despite heavy casualties resulting from landings at sea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Operation Broadway, which took place in Burma on March 5, 1944, glider pilots took the Japanese completely by surprise; carried troops, airborne engineers and equipment by night; seized and prepared landing strips for forthcoming transport planes; and evacuated the wounded, accomplishing in 2 hours what would have taken 2 months by ambulance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Overlord, D-Day, on June 6, 1944, glider pilots took part in the Battle of Normandy, the largest combined airborne and seaborne invasion in history, carrying troops of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and their equipment to landing areas behind enemy lines during the D-Day liberation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, many heroic glider pilots were killed as the hedgerows of Normandy of D-Day were actually rock walls that instantly destroyed the gliders. A survivor of the glider invasion was the legendary major, J. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who was elected to the U.S. Senate, achieving the age of 100 while still in office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Operation Dragoon, which took place in the coastal area of southern France on August 15, 1944, glider pilots delivered troops and cargo despite wooden poles erected in open fields to impede their landings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Market-Garden, the largest glider operation of World War II, took place in Holland on September 17, 1944. Glider pilots carried their usual cargo of troops and heavy equipment, thereby providing cover for an attempt to clear a road to Berlin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Operation Repulse, which took place in Bastogne on December 27, 1944, as part of the Battle of the Bulge, glider pilots, although flying directly through enemy fire, were able to land every glider, delivering badly needed ammunition, gasoline and medical supplies that enabled defenders against the German offensive to persevere and secure the ultimate victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America did not redeploy in the Ardennes offensive, but it stood with resolve for victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Operation Varsity, which took place at the Rhine crossing in Wesel, Germany, on March 24, 1945, more than 1,300 glider pilots took part in their final European mission, delivering a fatal blow to the Axis forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gliders' final, and only, Pacific mission took place in the Philippine island of Luzon, Philippines, on June 23, 1945. In Operation Gypsy Task Force-Appari mission, glider pilots carried members of the 11th Airborne Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of one pilot, "Imagine flying a motorless, fabric-covered CG-4A glider, violently bouncing and jerking on a 11/16-inch nylon rope 350 feet back of the C-47 tow plane. You see the nervous glider infantrymen behind you, some vomiting, many in prayer, as you hedge-hop along at tree-top level instinctively jumping up in your seat every time you hear bullets and flak tearing through the glider. You try not to think about the explosives aboard. It's like flying a stick of dynamite through  the gates of Hell."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we must not forget the sacrifices these pilots made for the betterment of our country and the world. Let us remember and honor the heroic service and the sacrifices made by the glider pilots. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hc" number="42">H. Con. Res. 42</bill> and commend Congresswoman McCarthy for her leadership on this issue</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to my friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank some of my colleagues who have been instrumental in getting this legislation to the floor today. Chairman Skelton of the Armed Services has done a tremendous job. We were under a lot of pressure to try and have the bill on the floor today, and I appreciate everything that he has done. Also, my good friend Congresswoman Nancy Boyda and Congressman Joe Wilson have been great friends to the glider pilots, and I thank you both for the issues that you  have been fighting for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here today to honor the glider pilots of the World War II. Glider planes were lightweight aircraft without engines that were used to drop supplies and reinforcement personnel for troops and surveillance. They were effective because they made no noise, and they could fly into enemy areas undetected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gliders would be towed by larger planes in order to take off, but then would fly and land on their own. The glider pilots flew dangerous missions and were constantly at risk of being shot down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard in the past that some of these pilots that volunteered to be glider pilots were suicidal. They were not. They wanted to fly, and they wanted to be part of protecting this Nation. So they became glider pilots because that was the only way they were going to get into the air at that particular time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glider pilots were instrumental in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, despite the fact that pilots had to improvise where to land, since no appropriate landing strips were known to be behind enemy lines. Later in the war, Germans would plant wooden poles in open fields to prevent glider pilots from landing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Army Air Forces began training glider pilots in 1941. The program quickly grew during the war. Eventually, thousands of men were trained to be glider pilots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout World War II, the glider pilots flew many successful missions. The glider pilots' first mission occurred on July 19, 1943. Operation Husky, which it was called, called for glider pilots to carry British airborne troops into Sicily. Despite the heavy casualties from landing at sea, the glider pilots did complete their mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March of 1944, the glider pilots completed Operation Broadway in Burma. The glider pilots took the Japanese completely by surprise, carrying troops, airborne engineers and equipment by night. They seized and prepared landing strips for forthcoming transport planes to evacuate the wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you think about World War II and you think about the equipment that these glider planes were carrying and how they were able to accomplish this feat as far as making roadways for wounded, they did it in 2 hours, in 2 hours. Completing a mission like that would have taken much, much longer. Usually a trip like that to the front lines to get the wounded back would have taken so much longer by ambulance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most famous mission of the glider pilots was the Battle of Normandy. On D-Day, the glider pilots participated in the largest combined airborne and seaborne invasion in history. They carried troops of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and their equipment to landing areas behind enemy lines. Their work helped to secure victory in World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, each year we lose more and more of these courageous veterans. We are lucky enough to have a glider pilot in the gallery with us today. His name is Michael Samek, and he is the gentleman that asked me to do whatever I could to recognize the glider pilots. I believe Congress must recognize their accomplishments for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you think about even the war today that we have, so many of our  young men and women and many people are coming home, and they are veterans. From the beginning of time, we have honored our veterans, and I am sure that we are going to find many other veterans that we have not honored, and I hope the committees will honor each and every one of them as time goes on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that is why I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 42. This bill recognizes the glider pilots and the many troops who put their lives on the line to defend the ideas and the freedoms of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of the glider missions were successful. Unfortunately, casualties were still suffered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier today, "Silent Wings," a DVD on these brave men, was released. Robert Childs, who was the director who became interested in glider pilots, started working on this project almost 11 years ago. I will be sponsoring the screening of the film tonight for all Members and staff. These events help to truly honor the sacrifices and bravery of the glider pilots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope you will all join me in celebrating with these veterans. We must remember and teach future generations about the sacrifices that glider pilots and all our veterans made for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the glider pilots and to vote for <bill type="hc" number="42">H. Con. Res. 42</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I will say there is not enough that we can do for the men and women certainly of past generations and for this generation that support our country, fight for our country to give us our freedom, and for that, I truly am honored to be able to sponsor this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, again I want to congratulate Congresswoman McCarthy for her obvious appreciation of the veterans of World War II, her obvious sincerity for the veterans of World War II. We are so grateful that we have present today veterans who are the greatest generation. With my six visits to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan, I have seen the new greatest generation, and again, I want to congratulate Congresswoman McCarthy for her leadership and urge  my colleagues to vote in favor of House Concurrent Resolution 42.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are very, very fortunate today to have one of these courageous glider pilots with us in the gallery, and I would like to take this opportunity to ask him to stand and to have us give him our recognition, please. Michael Samek is in the gallery, and we thank you so much for your courageous contributions to our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members are reminded that it is not in order under the rules to draw attention to persons in the gallery.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Kansas and, of course, my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York, for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was here on the floor doing 1-minutes, and then I started to listen to the debate, and I think it is very important that this resolution be introduced for a number of reasons, but I also wanted to relate it, if I could, to my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that many of the exploits of veterans during World War II, including Air Force veterans, and I know the Army Air Force, that is what they were called then, are kind of unsung. People are not aware of it. People are not necessarily aware of the different units and how they served, and including the Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I notice that in the resolution she particularly mentions that not only are we honoring the service and sacrifice of the glider pilots, but we are also urging the people of the United States to remember and teach future generations about the contributions and sacrifices that glider pilots and all veterans have made to and for the United States, and I have to relate a story with my own dad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My father was in the Army Air Force during World War II. He served in the Pacific, and he was a tail gunner with the reconnaissance forces, the planes that came in and took the pictures before I guess the other missions with bombs and other things took place. And for a long time, he is 83 now, for a long time when I was growing up, he would never talk about it, and I could never really understand why. In fact, he would never even want to take an airplane. He apparently served in the Pacific,  came back, and went across the country by train instead of using an airplane to get back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One day, we were down in Washington, and we went to the Air and Space Museum with my son, who is now 11 years old, but then maybe he was 6 or 7 years old. My father all of the sudden started to tell the story about his time during World War II because he saw some of the planes in the Air and Space Museum that were involved in some of those combat operations. It was such a tremendous experience for my son to hear my father talk about his experience during the war with reconnaissance planes and  also as a tail gunner. He never told about it in a heroic way; although everyone knows that was a very difficult position. Most of the tail gunners never came back. The majority actually were killed in action, even those that were involved in reconnaissance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was such a valuable experience for my son to hear his grandfather talk about that experience in the Army Air Force during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But I think a lot of the veterans simply don't tell the story. I don't really know why. I really think that when you draw attention to this, in this case the glider pilots, but there are others, when you draw attention to it and you make it a point that we need to follow up with our veterans and have them tell the story, it really is a very important thing, a lot more than I think a lot of people realize.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, I will certainly yield to the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is so important for those that are watching this when you have veterans out there. We have the oral history of our veterans that is going to the Library of Congress. I know projects that I have been doing back home, we have been working with an awful lot of veterans who were prisoners of war, because what you said earlier is so true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans need to be remembered for everything that they have done for this Nation, but certainly there are so many veterans out there that are not honored. I just wanted to say that with your words and talking about your father, and I know that our colleague here probably wants to talk about her dad, who was also in the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I really appreciate your words, and I really think that all of us should be encouraging our veterans to talk about their experiences so the younger generation does know about it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate your comments, and, I, again, appreciate the fact that you have introduced this resolution and that we are moving it today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my father, again, and it's so good to hear us talk about the generation that has come before us, my father was actually in a submarine in the South Pacific during World War II. Like many of our fathers, mine only recently has begun to really tell us what went on and those experiences as he was fighting for our country back during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so appreciative of my colleague and friend, Mrs. McCarthy, for bringing this to our attention. I hope that at some point we can take the same opportunity to honor those who have served in those submarines, not only during World War II, but today. It is a dangerous service and clearly these men love their country and are willing to do what it takes to defend the rights and to keep our country free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I appreciate the gentlewoman from New York in bringing this bill forward and any support that we can bring to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Kansas (Mrs. Boyda) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="42">H. Con. Res. 42</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
