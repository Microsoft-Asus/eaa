    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="3180">S. 3180</bill>, a bill to temporarily extend programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the beginning of February, the House took steps to reauthorize the Higher Education Act in passing <bill type="h" number="4137">H.R. 4137</bill>, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. We now find ourselves in the near final phase of completing the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act as we work toward a compromise bill with the Senate to ensure that the doors of college are truly open to all qualified students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our goal to ensure that a final bill encompasses the major issues addressed in <bill type="h" number="4137">H.R. 4137</bill>, including skyrocketing college prices, a needlessly complicated student aid application process, and predatory tactics by student lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill under consideration today, <bill type="s" number="3180">S. 3180</bill>, will extend the programs under the Higher Education Act until July 31, 2008, to allow sufficient time for final deliberations on the two bills reported out of the respective Chambers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been nearly 10 years since the Higher Education Act was last reauthorized, and I believe the Members on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers are anxious to complete the work on this bill in this Congress. We believe it can happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to joining my colleagues on the committees in both the House and the Senate in completing our work on behalf of this Nation's hardworking families and students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="3180">S. 3180</bill>, a bill to temporarily extend the Higher Education Act of 1965. This bill will provide a clean extension of the Higher Education Act for 1 more month as we continue to work with our Senate colleagues to hammer out a conference agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying reauthorization of the Higher Education Act is long overdue. Since 2003 Congress has passed twelve extensions, two reconciliation bills, an emergency student loan bill, and the House has passed two reauthorization bills. In the reauthorization bill passed by this Congress, we strengthened Pell Grants, improved the Perkins Loan program, and expanded access to college for millions of American students. The reauthorization bills also included important reforms that will provide more  transparency to American families on the cost of college. A recent report found that since 1983, the cost of keeping colleges running has outpaced the consumer price index by 48 percent. The average total for tuition fees, room and board, for an in-State student at a public 4-year college is $13,589. It jumps to $32,307 for a student attending a private 4-year college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is a clean extension bill that will allow the current programs of the Higher Education Act to continue past their current June 30, 2008, expiration date until July 31, 2008. Programs like Pell Grants and Perkins Loans are the passports out of poverty for millions of American students. We must complete our work on the conference agreement prior to the August recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="s" number="3180">S. 3180</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
