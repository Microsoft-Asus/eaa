    <paragraph>Mr. President, finally, I wish to urge this administration to provide a 100-percent disaster declaration for at least these parishes. Our Governor has asked for 100 percent for all the parishes--and I am going to put up that chart in a minute--but the Governor believes the entire State deserves to have a 100-percent reimbursement because Gustav went through our whole State, and then Ike came up a few weeks later and flooded and did a tremendous amount of wind damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not designated as a 100-percent cost share yet, which means the Federal Government would step in and pick up 100 percent of some of these parishes that are on their last leg. They have been through four storms in the last couple years. Unfortunately, and I am not sure why, but several counties in Texas have been granted the first 0 to 14 days at 100 percent. Yet our parishes, which were hit equally as hard, have not yet received that designation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am asking, on their behalf and with the full support of our Governor, our Lieutenant Governor, and others who are leading our effort in the recovery, if the administration would please consider at least giving equal treatment--100 percent, 0 to 14--for the parishes that were as hard hit as the Texas counties were in this aerial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But do not forget, as I close, that when Hurricane Gustav was in the gulf, our Governor called for a mandatory evacuation, and 2 million people, the largest evacuation in the country's history, left their homes to move temporarily, for a couple days, and then came back. The damage was very bad. It wasn't catastrophic such as Katrina, but it was as bad as Hurricane Rita. But when they came home, the Federal Government said: Well, thank you for evacuating, but there is virtually no help for you  or your counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is expensive to evacuate. I know people don't understand, those who have never had to go through it, but it costs hundreds of dollars to fill your tank with gas, if you have a car; it costs hundreds of dollars to stay at a hotel, even if it is just for a day or two; it costs hundreds of dollars to drive down the road to pick up your elderly aunt or your grandmother, who lives in another parish, to get her to evacuate. I can't tell you the expense that people incur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think the Federal Government should pick up 100 percent of the expense of mandatory evacuations, but I do think, for some period in some parishes, particularly those that have been very hard hit, that the Government, the Federal Government, if they can do it for some of the counties in Texas, most certainly should consider the parishes in Louisiana. So I am going to submit that as my last plea for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know it has been a long day, but I feel as if we got some things accomplished. I don't know what the schedule will be as the leaders decide on how we bring this particular Congress to a close, but I have to say the work of the recovery is still going on. It will go on for many years. My heart goes out to my neighbors from Texas who are just now discovering with awe and shock, shock and awe, what a hurricane can mean. They haven't had one in 50 years, such as the one in Galveston, and they had  one last week. So I know what they are experiencing because we have been through that. I will stand ready to work with them in my committee, as chair of the Subcommittee on Disaster, when we return. Whether it is floods in the Midwest or hurricanes in</paragraph>
