    <paragraph>Mr. President, when the Texas A&amp;M sailboat Cynthia Woods capsized off the coast of Texas, Safety Officer Roger Stone was trapped below deck with two other men. It was a frightening event, which would have put anyone into a panic. But Stone, thinking of his crewmates before himself, pushed Steven Guy and Travis Wright out of the upturned sinking boat's cabin, saving their lives. He did not have time to escape. Roger Stone was a heroic Aggie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The remaining crew was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard 26 hours later. Only after Steven Guy and Travis Wright retold the story did Roger Stone's family find out what happened. While the pain of losing a loved one is tremendous, the Stone family should find some comfort in Roger's courageous and selfless acts. His brave sacrifice is a lasting testament to his great character and personal strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Roger was originally from London, England, but came to Texas to work at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He had been sailing his entire life. Roger and his wife Linda were engaged on a sailboat and were married in the port--Veracruz--that the Cynthia Woods was bound for. Throughout Roger's career he was always serving others, from teaching younger sailors to helping competitors. In addition to his wife Linda Stone, Roger was survived by his daughter Elizabeth Stone, son Eric  Stone, mother Doris Stone, and sister Valerie Stone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These heroic actions are something we all can admire. At the age of 53 Roger gave his life to save the lives of others. This ultimate sacrifice is embodied in chapter 15, verse 13 of the Book of John, "Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends." This courageous deed leaves a lasting legacy for his wife and his children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Roger's friends and family will mourn his loss, the people of Texas will honor with solemn pride his heroism. I join today in commending his courage, and honoring his sacrifice.</paragraph>
