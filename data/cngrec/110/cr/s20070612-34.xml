    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Councilwoman-at-large Pearl D. Williams of Slidell for being named volunteer of the year by the United Way of St. Tammany Parish. I would like to take some time to make a few remarks on her success and her contributions to Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Councilwoman Williams has long enjoyed volunteering with various organizations in order to assist the community, especially needy children, and this award recognizes the hard work and success she has constantly rendered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Councilwoman Williams has shown tireless dedication to the United Way. Williams has served on the St. Tammany United Way Leadership Council as a progressive, active fundraiser who helped establish various committees and celebrations in order to benefit different charities. She also served on the board of directors for the Children's Wish Endowment and as past president of the Slidell Memorial Hospital Women's Health Alliance, among many other great accolades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Councilwoman Pearl D. Williams passed away of heart failure at the age of 64 on Thursday, May 17, 2007, at her residence. She is survived by not only proud family members but also the grateful city of Slidell who will never forget Councilwoman Williams' selfless acts of generosity and charity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, today, I rise to honor Councilwoman Pearl D. Williams so that more people can understand the kind of sacrifices she gave for others.</paragraph>
