  <narrative>HONORING SENATOR GWENDOLYN BRITT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H537]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the civil rights movement was full of heroes whose names we know and many whose names we will never know despite the depth of their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, this Nation remembered Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose good works are known to our Nation and to the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am honored to remember and celebrate the life of another extraordinary civil rights leader who helped stand up against injustice in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State Senator Gwendolyn Britt passed away recently, but she left behind an extraordinary legacy. She first stood up against racial segregation not in Montgomery, Alabama, but in Montgomery County, Maryland, at Glen Echo Park, just a 20-minute drive from this Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a hot summer evening in June 1960. Glen Echo Park was segregated at  the time, and Gwendolyn Britt, an African American, purchased a ticket to ride on the carousel. She was arrested that day, and her case went to the Supreme Court of this country. It was the first of many brave acts in standing up against injustice by Gwendolyn Britt, a person who changed our community and changed our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The civil rights movement was full of heroes, some whose names we all know, and many whose names we never learned despite the depth of their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently we remembered Dr. Martin Luther King, whose name and accomplishments have become well known as part of our country's history. And we know the story of Mrs. Rosa Parks, who showed courage when others were silent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am honored to remember and celebrate the life of another extraordinary civil rights leader, a woman who, like Dr. King and Mrs. Parks, never sought credit for her actions, but only sought to do what was right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was only 18 years old when the world first met Gwendolyn Greene. It was a hot summer evening in June 1960 when Gwendolyn Greene, a student at Howard University entered Glen Echo Park. At that time, blacks were not allowed to enter that amusement park. This park, incidentally, is within 20 minutes of the floor on which I am speaking, just outside the District of Columbia in Montgomery County, Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Greene joined a small group of young people at the gates of this popular local park, determined to introduce freedom and equality through desegregation to Montgomery County, Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen Greene chose to stand up. Despite the fear these young people felt, despite all of the turmoil they knew would arise from their illegal action, they entered Glen Echo Park. Gwen bought a ticket for the merry-go-round, and bravely and boldly sat upon a spotted horse, refusing to move until arrested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that very moment, this young woman chose to effect change. She didn't take the easy way out; she didn't stick with what was comfortable and safe. Not even after a trip to jail and the United States Supreme Court--not even after again being arrested, this time in Jackson, Mississippi, and spending 40 days in jail for refusing to leave a "whites-only" waiting room at a train station--would she be dissuaded from taking her fight for equal rights around the Nation as a Freedom Rider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen Greene later married, became Gwen Britt, and the mother of two sons. She worked for the telephone company for many years. But the effect of her action at Glen Echo and as a Freedom Rider was not lost on her. As she said many years later, "I became determined to do what I could to make a person's life better."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, throughout her life, that's what she tried to do, eventually culminating in her election to the Maryland State Senate in 2002. There, she quickly became a leader on issues that matter, such as education, health care, and civil rights. As one of the State senators in my congressional district, I was pleased to work in partnership with her on issues and projects that benefited our constituents and our State. At every meeting, I was inspired by the courtesy with which she treated everyone and  the collaborative spirit she brought to every issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gwen Britt never shied away from standing up for those who could not stand up for themselves. She went about her life's work with quiet dignity and humility, accomplishing so much for so many. Many who have benefited from Senator Britt's work never knew of her courageous stands on behalf of justice and equality. Many never knew that this brave woman, this woman who rarely sought the limelight, made such a profound difference in so many lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Gwen Britt was dedicated to doing what was right. She serves as an inspiration to us all to fight for what is right regardless of the consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Webster's defines "courage" as mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty. In Gwen Britt, this word is personified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heartfelt condolences go to Travis Britt, Gwen Britt's devoted husband and partner, and to their two sons, Travis, Jr. and John. Our country thanks you for sharing your wife and mother with us so that she could make a difference in our lives.</paragraph>
