  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the service and memory of my friend, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. His exemplary service in the Congress over the past 18 years is a shining example of the good that can be accomplished for the public benefit. A 1955 graduate of the University of Wyoming, Senator Craig demonstrated considerable leadership early in his life; he entered the Marine Corps soon after graduation and rose in rank from private to captain  in just 4 years. Following his service, Senator Thomas returned to Wyoming to make a difference in his native State, serving as executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau and later as general manager of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association. In 1984, Senator Thomas first entered public service as a State representative, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1989, and finally ascended to the Senate in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my honor to work with Senator Thomas during his Senate career. He was a firm believer in compromise and bipartisanship. This was no more evident than when he and I introduced legislation to protect taxpayer privacy. We worked together on a broad range of issues from protecting consumers to stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons to Iran. Senator Thomas and I shared a belief in this body and what it can achieve. I am very saddened by this tremendous loss, but the memory of Senator  Thomas and his good deeds remind us all of a long, rich life that should be celebrated, and I respectfully request that this statement be entered into the RECORD.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, Senator Craig Thomas was a wonderful friend to all of us. He was an accomplished Senator, and he was a true cowboy. It is that spirit that won't be replaced in the Senate, and it is that spirit that I would like to remember today. Craig's record in the Senate will reflect his significant accomplishments, and I wish to honor the quality of the man who achieved them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a special affinity for Craig. Not only did he and I come to the Senate at the same time, we had also served in the House of Representatives together. Craig came to the House in 1989, 2 years after I did, when he won a special election to replace our current Vice President, DICK CHENEY, who had been made Secretary of Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We, of course, were also fellow westerners, and I admired the manner in which he embodied the values of the West: the self-reliance, grit, and quiet determination of pioneers that shape Americans still today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These values were impressed into Craig as he grew up on a ranch near Cody, WY. Those values of the American West, instilled by the rugged landscape of Wyoming, would serve him well in the Marine Corps and in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig did not talk a whole lot, but he always meant what he said. He communicated in a way that didn't require a whole lot of "jibber-jabber," as he would say. Everyone appreciated this quality in him. You never had any doubt about where Craig stood, something our public officials could learn from today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig understood that words and rhetoric easily vanish from our memories. He recognized that honor is not won by keeping up appearances but by working hard and accomplishing what you set out to do. He understood that the best way to accomplish difficult things was to get busy doing them. To Craig, this was common sense, but oftentimes common sense is all too uncommon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his commonsense manner, he served the people of Wyoming who overwhelming elected him to the Senate on three occasions. Craig let the interests of the State guide his work in the Senate. He never let his ego get in the way of doing what was best for Wyoming and the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Caryll and I grieve with Craig's wife Susan and their family. But, in our grief, we also celebrate his life. There is much to celebrate not only in Craig's accomplishments--whether on behalf of our national parks, farmers, or rural families, to name only a few of his legislative priorities--but also in his character. He was a humble servant for Wyoming who stood up for the people of his State. Even in his illness, he never wavered from his duties as a legislator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The values of the American West are the commonsense values that make self-government possible. Craig Thomas, the cowboy and statesman, embodied these values that made this country what it is and are needed to sustain it in years to come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join with my fellow Senators and so many in Wyoming and throughout the country in expressing my profound sadness on the passing of my colleague and good friend, Senator Craig Thomas. I also want to offer my most sincere condolences to his wife Susan, their four children, and the entire Thomas family at this most difficult of times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we mourn the loss of a true patriot whose love of country and loyalty to its principles were always an inspiration and example to us all. A U.S. Marine captain, an advocate for rural concerns with the Wyoming Farm Bureau, American Farm Bureau, and the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, and an indefatigable public servant as a Member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate--Senator Thomas always placed a premium on bettering the lives  of the citizens of his state, ensuring that their concerns were not only heard--but were addressed vigorously, effectively, and with results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall the distinct honor and privilege of serving with Craig for more than 17 years both in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. Indeed, we entered the Senate in the same class of 1994, and I remember with tremendous regard our service together on the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Finance Committees. Time and again, regardless of the issue, Craig exhibited a stalwart dedication to his country and his constituents--with a steadfast devotion that was ever mindful of the public trust placed  in his hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was unwavering in his allegiance to the tenets that guided his life. True to his core beliefs and unshakable in the values he drew from his beloved Wyoming, Senator Thomas held fast to his philosophy of fiscal conservatism. And yet when he advanced his arguments, he did so without rancor and with the utmost respect and cordiality. He possessed an unyielding decorum that contributed to his esteemed presence in the Senate, and he had at his disposal that indispensable tool of politics--humor,  which he used to great effect and at times with incredibly disarming outcomes. Even when we disagreed, he was never disagreeable, rather choosing to give no more than an occasional good-natured ribbing--always with a smile on his face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleague MIKE ENZI stated in his tribute, Craig Thomas was not one who necessarily sought the limelight. He lived his life and comported himself in a manner that exemplified the words President Ronald Reagan displayed on his desk in the Oval Office: "There's no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit." Whether on matters of rural health, safeguarding the interest and concerns of farmers, or reducing the deficit, Craig focused on making  concrete strides, not amassing accolades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the arena of public life, regardless of trial, tribulation, or triumph, Senator Craig Thomas remained a compassionate person of immense caliber who served the best interests of the people of Wyoming with unyielding advocacy, integrity of purpose, and uncommon civility. We will miss his benevolent nature, his good will, and his great deeds. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and staff here in Washington and in Wyoming.</paragraph>
