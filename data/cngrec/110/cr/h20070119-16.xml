    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor this morning with my good friend and colleague, RICHARD NEAL of Massachusetts, to draw attention to the Northern Ireland peace process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many remember Northern Ireland's troubles with the endless bombings, bullets, bloodshed and continuous cycle of violence. The fight was for civil rights and national aspiration. The combatants made a conscious decision to end the killing and reach a compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the efforts of the British, Irish and American governments and the political leaders of Northern Ireland, we have had peace for about 10 years. But they are still struggling to implement the Good Friday Agreement that provides for power sharing, proportional representation and self-governance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, in the face of significant criticism, Sinn Fein has delivered on every commitment outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now look to Ian Paisley and the Democratic Unionist Party to step up and deliver on behalf of the Unionist community. It is time for the DUP to validate their word given at St. Andrews by unequivocally committing to a devolved power sharing government with Sinn Fein. They must make good on their word and consummate their remarkable achievement. An historic moment is dawning on the island of Ireland. It is time to act.</paragraph>
