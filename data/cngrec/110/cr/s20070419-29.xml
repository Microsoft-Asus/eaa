Throughout his career, Officer Winget demonstrated a passion for law enforcement and commitment to helping others, qualities that enabled him to become a beloved member of the Ripon Police Department. Officer  Wignet's colleagues and the people whom he protected shall always remember him for his devotion to serving the community.</paragraph>
