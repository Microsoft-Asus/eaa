  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the December 24, 2007, "Year in Pictures" edition of Sports Illustrated featured a mud-soaked and elated Brandon Day on the cover. Day is a junior linebacker for the Fighting Saints of Carroll College in my hometown of Helena, MT. This amazing image was captured by photographer John Russell following the Fighting Saints fifth National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics football title in the past six seasons on December 15, 2007, in Savannah, TN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story of this team and the cover photo on Sports Illustrated has really moved me. With all the negative stories recently in the sports world, it was both heartening and appropriate for the magazine to honor the spirit of intercollegiate athletics by shining the spotlight on such a hard-working and deserving group of student athletes. The young men that make up Carroll's football squad truly embody the best of these ideals and Montana values. They have worked hard both on and off the field  and have achieved not only athletic glory, but also success in the classroom and have given much back to the Helena community and their hometowns. Coming from small towns across Montana and the West, these student athletes certainly don't demand or expect this kind of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This strength of character is certainly a tribute to their fine and caring coach, Mike Van Diest, who has taught his players that devotion to school, family, and faith come before football. He demands excellence from his players both on and off the field, as does the president of the school, Dr. Thomas Trebon. Dr. Trebon recently wrote a letter to Sports Illustrated that tells the story of the Fighting Saints. I thank Dr. Trebon for all of his hard work and leadership at Carroll College, and  I look forward to cheering on the Saints again in 2008. I know that they will continue to make Montana proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask to have the letter from Dr. Trebon printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material follows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR SPORTS ILLUSTRATED: All of Montana is thrilled by the SI "2007 Pictures of the Year" front cover featuring Carroll College junior linebacker Brandon Day's euphoric reaction to the Fighting Saints' fifth NAIA National Football Championship win.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The untold story about the Saints found honest reflection in the SI cover photo, with Day and his victorious teammates soaked in mud while overcome with joy. It's a story about humble happiness through hard work, where every standout member of the Saints who receives recognition promptly points to his teammates as the real reason for their success. It's the story of Fighting Saint Luke DenHerder, who returned to the gridiron after beating a lethal cancer, while his fellow student-athletes cheered  him and even shaved their heads in solidarity during his chemotherapy. It's the story of a team comprised of men hailing primarily from rural Western towns, ranches and farms, from struggling middle-class families, who know the meaning of hard work and who haven't seen much glory in return. Until now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carroll's story is about two-time NAIA National Coach of the Year (2003 and 2005) Mike Van Diest, who led the Saints to all five national championship wins, all while demanding that our athletes' priorities must be God first, family second, school third and football last. Indeed, the press corps following our team to Tennessee took more photos of our players studying for their final exams and volunteer reading to school children in Savannah, Tenn., than engaged in pre-game practice. This fall,  seven Fighting Saints were named national Daktronics-NAIA Football Scholar-Athletes, the team maintains a grade point average over 3.2, and nearly half of our football squad is selected yearly as All-Academic honorees in the Frontier Conference. Yet, the true story about</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these days when more of us long for a return to civility and yearn to see our star athletes and athletic programs meet the high standards of role models, SI's cover photo was distinctly gratifying. In one shot, photographer John Russell captured both a moment of athletic triumph and distilled our dream of bringing back the values of simpler times, when good men from humble beginnings win out in the end and become heroes.</paragraph>
