    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take 10 minutes to talk about a situation that is happening in the West. I thank my colleagues for giving me that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spoke last week, and the background of my speech was this graph called a Budget Inferno. I was en route to Idaho to look at a fire complex known as the Murphy Fire Complex. That is now under control. In other words, a perimeter is around the fire. It happens to be 1,038 square miles of fire, nearly 700,000 acres, and $6.6 million spent. Type 1 teams, 2 of them; 24 crews, 1,230 personnel; 120 engines, 5 helicopters, 27 water tenders, and 10 dozers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The firefighters who went in harm's way to work and stop this fire were gallant and I honor them. As I speak, there are literally thousands of young men and women out on the fire line in Idaho and Montana and parts of Nevada and elsewhere standing in harm's way to stop raging wildfires that are devastating the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was the largest fire Idaho has had in literally decades. It is now the largest single fire this year in total acreage. Why did it happen? Is there a reason? Was it simply the hot weather or are there other reasons that are creating these huge infernos of wildfire across the West as we speak?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, 10 million acres burned. This year, it appears we are on schedule to have an even greater fire season than we had last year. A month ago, I put a half a billion more dollars in the Interior appropriations budget to fight fire. My guess is when we get back in September, I and others will be on the floor asking for supplemental spending to pay for more wildfire devastation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good news, in the great tragedy of the Murphy Fire, was that no one was killed. There were four firefighters injured, there were hundreds of cattle burned up, hundreds of sheep, probably hundreds of wildlife that we simply do not know about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have this huge area, some 600,000 acres that will be of no use to anyone, including cattle grazing, including wildlife, for a period of several years. It is totally burned out. I flew over it in a helicopter with our Governor and Senator Crapo. None of us has ever experienced anything like that. You fly for half an hour at 100-plus miles an hour across a firescape, and all of it is black, the hilltops, the valleys, no trees, nothing left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what happened a few years ago. Here is what is happening now in the West. We ought to be doing something about it. Two years ago, there was a fire out there, 200,000 acres right in the same area. We rehabbed it. We grassed it, and the BLM said you cannot graze it for a couple of years now. Cattle might damage it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there was another fire last year, 60,000 acres right beside it. We rehabbed it. We seeded it. You cannot graze it. At least that is what the scientists say. That is not what those who have lived out there for a hundred years say. We left it alone and the fuel built up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we had someone sue us to protect the sage grouse habitat and the slickspot peppergrass, and a judge ruled. So we stopped grazing on half of that area, and the fuel built up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we are in a fire scenario, with temperatures in the West that we have never seen. So we had 3 weeks of 100-degree temperatures in the Boise Valley, and the dewpoint dropped to nearly zero. You know the rest of the story because I told you that story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An unprecedented fuel buildup because a judge, and what I now call ecoterrorists, are destroying the landscape by not allowing reasonably managed, multiple-use approaches to our management. That is why the fire destroyed what it destroyed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An unprecedented fuel loading is on the grasslands of our country. Now, because it is a little hotter, it is a little further into the summer, our timberlands are starting to burn. They, too, are loaded with fuel, and they will burn at unprecedented rates as they did last year and the year before and the year before that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we are spending billions of dollars and destroying millions of acres of wildlife, watershed, wildlife habitat, all of those things combined. Our courts are saying: Get the people off the land, get the livestock off the land, rule in the favor of single-use management, here, there, and everywhere, tying the hands of our managers at the BLM and the Forest Service level, denying them the right to use their knowledge, use their scientific understanding for reasonable flexibility in the management  we so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the story of the Murphy Complex; that is the story of nearly 700,000 acres of total destruction; $6.6 million, and by the time we are done rehabilitating it, it could go to nearly $8 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is there something we can do about it? Well, there will be interest groups who will rush back here, and in the name of the environment say do nothing--in the name of the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please, let us do something. Because the habitat the judge and the ecoactivists argued for to save the sage grouse and the slickspot peppergrass is no longer there. The enemy, some were the cattle that were grazing, they are no longer the enemy. The fire has become the enemy and that which they who ruled sought to save is now gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That story that I have related to you, whether it is played out in the Murphy Complex in Idaho and Nevada, or whether it is in Northern California, or whether it was in the Tahoe Basin this year, or whether it is in Eastern Oregon, or whether it is in the mountains of Idaho, will be played out and millions of acres will burn and billions of dollars will be spent and homes will be destroyed and we will say: Gee, I think we got a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress will fail to respond and act to give our managers the flexibility, and we will continue to allow judges in the Ninth Circuit and environmental interests to game us and create these single, unique special kinds of management units that are impossible in any way to manage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to relate to you this story. The State BLM director, our Governor, myself, and my colleague, Mike Crapo, flew over this devastation. In the terms of a cowboy who has lived out there all his life and his father before him and his father before him:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator, you ain't never seen anything like this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, boy, we have not. The great tragedy is, more will come, and more is burning now. Several fires are burning in Idaho. We are already nearly over a million acres in my State alone. Yet our hands are tied by a bureaucracy that is strangled by court decision after court decision because Congress will not act in the name of the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been scared into environmentalism instead of good and reasonable management. We are allowing our courts and our activist organizations to create the wildfire which has become a budget inferno.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the reason I give this speech now is because we have entered the fire season. August is our fire season. September is our fire season. My guess is I will be returning as one of the members of the Appropriations Committee and the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee saying: Please, my colleagues, could we have a couple billion more dollars to fight these fires? Because we are burning up out there, and there is not much we seem to be able to do about it because we have decided to allow public  land management to be turned over to the activists and the judges instead of the professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Idaho burns tonight. Montana burns tonight. Nevada burns tonight, California, parts of Oregon, parts of Utah. I think it is important you hear this story and try to begin to understand that when we talk about balance and flexibility, you help us get there so we do not have to spend our budget in a useless and irresponsible way.</paragraph>
