  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. On June 29-July 1, the residents of Granville will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Granville is a friendly rural community located in northern North Dakota. William Christianson, along with his wife Minnie, were the first non-native people to settle the soon-to-be prairie town of Granville in 1895. William was an employee of the Great Northern Railway, and the town of Granville was named after Granville M. Dodge, a civil engineer for the railway. Established in 1901, the Granville State bank was one of the first businesses established. Granville was officially declared a city  in 1907.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, like so many smaller rural communities in North Dakota, Granville is a tight-knit town where everyone knows their neighbor. Granville is known for its welcoming hospitality and conversation and it is easy to witness this local atmosphere at Granville's Memorial Diner. A beautiful city park offers a chance for parents and their children to have fun and play together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community of Granville is a wonderful place for its citizens to live and experience life together. The people of Granville take great pride in their community and all it has to offer. To celebrate their centennial anniversary, the town will be holding a barbeque, wagon train, parade, and fireworks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Granville, ND and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well through the next century. By honoring Granville and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Granville that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Granville has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
