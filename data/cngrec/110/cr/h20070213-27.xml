  <speaking speaker="412196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring legislation, <bill type="hj" number="21">H.J. Res. 21</bill>, which would add a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment sets the financially responsible goal of balancing the budget by the year 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the national debt is $8.6 trillion. Each taxpayer's share of that debt is almost $29,000. In fiscal year 2006, over $400 billion of taxpayers' money was spent on interest payments to the holders of the national debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year the interest paid on the national debt was the third largest expense of the Federal budget. The debt is increasing by over $1 billion every day. Our economy is ready for us to set this important priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year alone Federal revenues increased 11.8 percent. Receipts this year have grown by 8 percent so far in the first quarter compared to last year in that first quarter. Forty-nine out of 50 States, including my home State of Florida, currently have a balanced budget. It is time that we follow the lead there and balance the budget for the country.</paragraph>
