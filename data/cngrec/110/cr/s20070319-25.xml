  <speaking speaker="300081" topic="Introducing S. 911. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to advance medical research and treatments into pediatric cancers, ensure patients and families have access to the current treatments and information regarding pediatric cancers, establish a population-based national childhood cancer database, and promote public awareness of pediatric cancers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="911">S. 911</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Coleman, in introducing the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan legislation seeks to achieve several important goals in our battle against childhood cancer. Specifically, it will expand support for pediatric cancer research, foster the career development of more pediatric oncologists, establish a population-based national childhood database, and provide essential information and support to help families dealing with this devastating disease. Childhood cancer impacts thousands of children and their families each year. While we have made great  strides in treating cancer, we have made relatively little progress in advancing our understanding of the most common forms of pediatric cancer. This legislation will provide the focus and resources to hopefully one day find a cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, more than 12,500 children are diagnosed with cancer, and more than 2,300 of them lose their courageous battle with the disease. Pediatric cancer not only takes a toll on the child, it affects the entire family--the parents, siblings, friends, and extended family all suffer when a child has cancer. I have had the honor of meeting one such family from Warwick, RI who has taken the pain and devastation of losing their nine year old son to neuroblastoma, a very aggressive childhood cancer,  and turned their tragedy into a message of hope. The Haight family is committed, in memory of their son Ben, to providing education, advocacy, and support to other families going through a similar struggle with pediatric cancer. I never had a chance to meet Ben Haight but his mother</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that the bill we are introducing today will help to step up our efforts with regard to childhood cancer so that one day Ben's story, and thousands of other children like him, will be one of survival. In Rhode Island alone, about eight children each year succumb to various forms of childhood cancer. Each of these children had hopes, dreams, and desires that will never be fulfilled and one cannot quantify the impact each of these children could have had on their communities and on  society as a whole. We need to be doing more to give these children a chance to grow up and reach their full potential. It is expected that by 2010 one out of 350 adults will be a survivor of childhood cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act will build the foundation necessary to enhance federal efforts in the fight against childhood cancer and will also complement the incredible work of the network of organizations around the country dedicated to the prevention and cure of pediatric cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues toward swift passage of this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="Introducing S. 912. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the incentives for the construction and renovation of public schools; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="912">S. 912</bill>] Mr. President, today I am reintroducing America's Better Classroom Act, an essential initiative to respond to the overwhelming needs for school construction and renovations. I welcome the support of my colleagues, Senator Harkin, and Senator Kerry, who have been strong leaders on school construction and education policy. This bill is a wise investment in education and economic development; it creates jobs while we build and renovate our schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Education reports that the average public school building is 42 years old. In 1995, GAO estimated that we needed $112 billion for school construction and renovations of the three-quarters of our schools that need funding to bring the buildings into good overall condition. A more recent survey in 2001 in the Journal of Education Finance indicates that the need is increasing, and the unmet need for school infrastructure over the next decade is over $200 billion. My State of West  Virginia will need as much as $2 billion for school construction and renovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Combine these statistics with the fact that there is a proven relation between the condition of school buildings and the performance of students, and it is not difficult to see that the state of our schools is entirely unacceptable. It is our responsibility to do all we can to remedy this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's Better Classroom Act provides the financial tools to do this. It will continue the Qualified Zone Academy Bonding (QZAB) Program, which, in recent years, has provided $4.2 million for support of school construction and renovations in disadvantaged communities. This provision would provide $2.8 billion to continue and expand the successful QZAB Program. Effective programs deserve continued support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the truth is that many school districts need help with school construction and renovations, but cannot qualify for the QZAB program. This is why the America's Better Classroom Act creates a $22 billion Qualified School Bonding Program. Funding will be allocated to the States based on the Title 1 formula so it is targeted, but the States will have flexibility in allocating support among school districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I visit schools in West Virginia, I am often stunned by the aging buildings and compelling needs. In our fast-growing Eastern Panhandle, new schools must be built or renovated to accommodate rapid population growth. In other parts of the State, older school buildings need renovations to be safe learning environments for our students. As technology plays an increasingly important role in education, classrooms need to be updated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States and communities need the America's Better Classroom Act so that we can make needed investments. School construction can play a positive role in helping to stimulate our economy and create needed jobs and is also an important investment in our children's education.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="Introducing S. 916. A bill to modify the boundary of the Minidoka Internment National Monument, to establish the Minidoka National Historic Site, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain land and improvements of the Gooding Division of the Minidoka Project, Idaho, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="916">S. 916</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with the support of my colleague Senator Cantwell to introduce the Minidoka National Historic Site Act of 2007. This act will modify the boundary of the Minidoka Internment National Monument to establish the Minidoka National Historic Site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adjacent to the Minidoka Internment National Monument is Herrmann farm. Herrmann farm plays a historically significant role to the people of Idaho and the United States. During World War II, the Herrmann farm area was part of the Minidoka Relocation Center, one of the 10 city-like camps where Americans of Japanese descent were interned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Herrmann farm is also an excellent example of how relocation center land was transformed after the war into small family farms suitable for irrigation and farming. Many of these farms were allotted to World War II veterans. These veteran settlers put forth the same stubborn American spirit and ingenuity with which they helped to win the war, to promote the farm area into a fruitful and prosperous agricultural section.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Herrmann farm became one of a few Farm-In-A-Day sites within the United States, where members of a community joined together in the creation of a farm site within one day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Minidoka Internment National Monument area is also a notable educational tool for residents of Idaho and the United States. Herrmann farm is an excellent location to inform the public about the post-camp homesteading era and agriculture in south-central Idaho as buildings, features, and artifacts from both the relocation center and the Farm-In-A-Day are present at the Minidoka site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the historical and educational importance of Herrmann farm, the Minidoka Internment National Site honors the hardships and sacrifices of those Japanese Americans imprisoned during World War II. Many of the Japanese American's who lived at this site are reaching considerable age and want to see this area preserved for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The site will incorporate the Nidoto Nai Yoni, "Let it not happen again", memorial that commemorates those courageous Japanese Americans of Bainbridge Island, WA, who were the first to be forcibly removed from their homes and relocated to internment camps during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to move swiftly on this bill, so the remaining few Japanese Americans who are still alive today can revisit this site that holds such meaningful memories. It is with pleasure and the support of the Senator from Washington, that I introduce this act which preserves areas of historical and educational importance for the people of Idaho, Washington and the United States.</paragraph>
