    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for years, President Bush has prioritized the needs of the wealthiest few while taking us deep into debt and into an economic recession. In the meantime, most Americans have been forgotten. That is, until the Democrats took control of Congress last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were the first to recognize that our economy was headed for a recession and pushed the President to join us in passing the economic stimulus package that provided assistance to middle-income Americans. While that was a good start, we know that more needs to be done to help those who are not prospering under this Bush economy. That is why we extended unemployment insurance for the growing number of Americans looking for work and why we tackled the housing foreclosure crisis, so that millions  of Americans can keep their homes. We also support a second economic stimulus plan that invests in America, rather than in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are serious about working in a bipartisan fashion to turn this economy around, and the best way to do that is to prioritize the needs of hardworking, middle-class Americans.</paragraph>
