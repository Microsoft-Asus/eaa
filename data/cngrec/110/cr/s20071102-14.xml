    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force. As you are well aware, the Air Force was created by the National Security Act of 1947, the very same law that established the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of my colleagues in this distinguished Chamber, I represent a State with a rich history of involvement with and support for the U.S. Air Force. Less than 6 months after the Air Force was officially founded on September 18, 1947, the Las Vegas Air Force Base was reactivated to host a pilot training wing. With the onset of the Korean war, its mission changed from an advanced single-engine school to one of training jet fighter pilots for the then Far East Air Forces. And thus began a long  tradition of air combat training programs held at this site that has earned this Air Force base the proud nickname "Home of the Fighter Pilot."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No single airman in Nevada history exemplified the meaning behind this slogan more than LT William H. Nellis. Born in Santa Rita, NM, in 1916, as a young man Lieutenant Nellis moved to my hometown of Searchlight, Nevada, where his father--like so many other respectable Nevadans--worked as a hard rock miner. When World War II began, Lieutenant Nellis was already married with 2 children, but this passionate young man knew he could not remain uninvolved in America's effort to rid the world of foreign  oppression. After seeing a newsreel about the Army Air Corps, the precursor to the U.S. Air Force, he decided to enlist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the course of his valiant service, Lieutenant Nellis flew 69 missions over Europe and was shot down twice, surviving each crash and making his way back to Allied lines. Unwavering in his patriotism, he continued to volunteer to fly, doing what he saw as his duty for the great cause. Sadly, Lieutenant Nellis' last flight would come on December 27, 1944. During the Battle of the Bulge, an engagement that would cost the lives of nearly 20,000 Americans, Lieutenant Nellis was killed in action  while flying with the 513th Fighter Squadron, 406 Fighter Group over Bastogne.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To honor this great Nevadan and a true American hero, the Las Vegas Air Force Base was renamed in his honor on May 20, 1950. Ever since, Nellis Air Force Base has been a stalwart of Nevada's military infrastructure and has provided U.S. airmen with the very best aerial combat training in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the pinnacle of advanced air combat aviation training, Nellis Air Force Base has provided invaluable service to the United States and its efforts in the global war on terror. The mission statement at Nellis sums it up best,  "The crews do not come to learn how to fly, but instead how to be the best combat aviators in the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate this historic occasion, we must never forget the importance of places like Nellis Air Force Base. I know many of my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate share my belief that America's ability to project its military might in the skies around the world is a direct result of the expert training programs at facilities like Nellis. Today we honor all of the men and women who have served proudly in the U.S. Air Force over the past 60 years. We owe them a tremendous amount of gratitude  for their courageous sacrifices in defending the nation that we all work so hard to preserve.</paragraph>
