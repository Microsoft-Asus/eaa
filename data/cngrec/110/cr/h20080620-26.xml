  <narrative>COMMUTER ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5776]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>As gas prices rise, an effective way to offer relief is to provide incentives for commuter rail. Commuter rail saves America 4 million gallons of gas a day and saves each individual commuter over $1,600 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, the Speaker will bring up legislation that will offer only Federal employees transit benefits. I support expanding the current Federal transit program, and believe that all Americans should have the opportunity to have this relief at the pumps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A month ago, I introduced bipartisan legislation, the Creating Opportunities to Motivate Mass-transit Utilization To Encourage Ridership, or the COMMUTER Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation offers employers a 50 percent tax credit if they provide transit benefits to their employees. According to Forbes Magazine, the average gasoline cost in the 10 worst commuter cities is over $6 a day. Should businesses take advantage of this, we would lower our gas bills, but it should be offered to more than people with a Federal job.</paragraph>
