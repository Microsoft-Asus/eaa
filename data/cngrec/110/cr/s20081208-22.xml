    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday, December 7, 2008, was the 67th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor in which more than 2,400 courageous sailors, soldiers, and marines died. To those in Hawaii who, like me, witnessed the attack, the events of 67 years ago have a deep personal significance. I will never forget the courage and commitment of the soldiers, sailors, and ordinary men and women who did not hesitate to defend our Nation despite the enormous personal risk. For all Americans,  young and old, it is important to remember that out of this dark hour arose the courage and strength of a unified Nation. I honor the memories of all the survivors of the attack as well as the fallen heroes who fought to defend our Nation's principles of democracy and freedom that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, with so many of our troops serving overseas, I would also like recognize our armed services families by honoring the sacrifices of those who lost loved ones during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Our Nation owes these family members a debt of gratitude for their strength and perseverance during such a grievous time. I want to thank all the members of our armed forces--those that served in World War II, all those that have served since, and those who still serve today. Your daily sacrifices  protect and strengthen our country and allow us to enjoy the freedoms symbolic of the United States. Your courageous and dedicated efforts humble me, and may God bless you and your families as together we remember Pearl Harbor.</paragraph>
