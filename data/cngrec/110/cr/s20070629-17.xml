    <paragraph>Madam President, next Wednesday is July 4, Independence Day, the grand national celebration of our Nation's beginning. The Senate and the House of Representatives will be quiet, in recess so that Members can join in Independence Day celebrations around the country with constituents, families, and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 4, summer is approaching its zenith. The days are hot and sunny. Water in all forms lures children into the heat--in the country, shady streams offer relief; in urban areas, fountains or even fire hydrants answer the call, while across the country, swimming pools offer watery fun with an accompanying musical soundtrack of splashing and laughter. Even summer thunderstorms do their bit to cool things down while displaying nature's power and majesty as the lightning cracks and the thunder  booms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth of July celebrations are a wonderful time to glory in all that is good about the United States. Flags and fireworks, picnics and parades, mellow afternoons and martial music--everything about Independence Day is grand. As we join together to remember the bravery that led our Founding Fathers to draft the Declaration of Independence, the long struggle to win our freedom, and the enlightened wisdom that resulted in our unique and wonderful Constitution, the love of our Nation that is the  true spirit of patriotism is renewed. Surrounded by the happy faces of our diverse population enjoying their small town parades, music under the stars, family picnics and the grand finale of the fireworks displays, we can be sure that our Founding Fathers chose well when they gambled on a new nation in which "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Independence Day, when laughing children run with their sparklers to compete with the fireflies, we are also reminded of our own obligation to preserve for them all that is good about these United States. In this, we may also look to the Declaration of Independence, which ends with "a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For our Founding Fathers, this pledge was not mere rhetoric--their signatures on the declaration that hot summer in 1776 put at risk their families, their fortunes, their worldly possessions, and their lives. Some, like Edward Rutledge, age 26, were young men, with all of their life's promise ahead of them. Others, like Benjamin Franklin, age 70, were no longer so young, and the prospect of being hunted down for treason could not have been very appealing. Still, he did not shirk from signing  and has even been quoted as saying that "We must all hang together, or assuredly we will all hang separately," his witty way of warning the signers that any failure to remain united could result in each of them being tried and executed for treason. History has shown that his warning was not needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the years of war, even as some of the signers lost their homes or put their fortunes into the war effort, not one of them backed down. For that, we may all be thankful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even as the years of war passed, the signers of the Declaration of Independence continued to serve their new Nation. They served as ambassadors for the new United States, as Presidents and Vice Presidents, as Cabinet members, and as a source of inspiration and industry for the fledgling Nation into their old ages. It is fitting that Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, third President of the United States, Vice President, Secretary of State, Minister to France, Governor  of Virginia, colonial and State legislator, founder of the University of Virginia, farmer and philosopher, died at the age of 83 on the Fourth of July, 1826, on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. He worked and wrote prolifically until the very end of his life, always for the betterment of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the same day, July 4, 1826, John Adams passed away at the age of 91. President, Vice President, Member of the Continental Congress, farmer, and philosopher, Adams remains the longest lived person ever elected to both of the highest offices in the United States. Until his record was broken by Ronald Reagan in 2001, Adams was the nation's longest living President, at 90 years, 247 days. The record is currently held by former President Gerald Ford, who died December 26, 2006, at 93 years, 165  days. Adams and Jefferson's correspondence during their later years remains an invaluable historical record of the early days of our Republic, and their respect for each other was unmatched. Even as he died, Adams is said to have breathed, "Thomas Jefferson survives," in what may have been his final earthly comfort knowing that his friend remained to watch over the young Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is a great privilege to be able to call oneself a citizen of these United States. It is my great privilege to serve the Senate and the people of West Virginia and the United States. I feel that privilege every day but especially on the Fourth of July. I am inspired by our Founding Fathers and by the great documents that are the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Like Jefferson and Adams, I am inspired to continue serving the land that I love to the very best  of my abilities for the whole of my years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I close with a poem by Walter Taylor Field, entitled "Flag of the Free."</paragraph>
