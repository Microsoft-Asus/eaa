  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, on behalf of all Oregonians, I recognize the recent accomplishments of Madras, Oregon's own Jacoby Ellsbury of the World Champion Boston Red Sox.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a child growing up, I followed the Boston Red Sox closer than any other team. I recall my father telling me stories of the four west coast boys who were members of the Boston Red Sox in the 1940s. He told me about how they put their baseball careers on hold to defend our Nation at war. Two of those west coast boys, Johnny Pesky and Hall of Famer Bobby Doerr, had connections to Oregon and the Pacific Coast League. The story of these four young men from the west coast who became members of the  Boston Red Sox was highlighted in the late David Halberstam's book "The Teammates--A Portrait of Friendship." For the four friends, Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky and Dominic DiMaggio, it was about more than baseball. Their story is about the American dream and the bonds of friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall Williams, Pesky, Doerr, and DiMaggio when I see Jacoby Ellsbury on the field with his teammates: Dustin Pedroia and Jon Lester. Dustin, the Red Sox second baseman, hails from California and Arizona State University and pitcher Jon Lester grew up in Tacoma, WA. Jacoby hails from the small town of Madras, OR, in the central part of the State and was a first team All-American at Oregon State University in 2005 when he led his team to the College World Series for the first time since 1952.  Jacoby's career has blossomed on and off the field since joining the Boston Red Sox organization, and he is considered by many to be one of the game's future superstars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jacoby exhibits many of the qualities a young man should emulate. It is apparent that his work ethic, sportsmanship, and dedication to the game he loves have propelled him to the top of the baseball world. I praise his Mom and Dad, Margie and Jim, for a job well done. Oregonians and the Red Sox Nation are very proud of Jacoby Ellsbury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I wish to note how proud I am to recognize Jacoby, not only as an American and an Oregonian representing the Boston Red Sox so proudly, but I am equally proud to recognize him as a man of Native American descent, particularly the first of Navajo descent to play in the Major Leagues. The members of the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs in Oregon should be extremely proud of Jacoby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Jacoby Ellsbury and his teammates on winning the 2007 World Series and wish him the best of luck as he continues his professional career in Boston.</paragraph>
