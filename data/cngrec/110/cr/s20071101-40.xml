    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize David Pigott, Tonya Denke, Russell Bruner, and Abbi Wells, all of whom received the Founder's Award for Outstanding Achievement from the Black Hills Workshop in Rapid City, SD. This is a prestigious award that reflects the recipients' hard work and dedication to achieving independent living. It also reflects the valuable role they have played in giving back to their local community. Also, I would like to recognize McKie Automotive group for  receiving the Community Connection Award.</paragraph>

He is an excellent member of their staff and has been recognized for his hard work by being named the Employee of the Month twice and Employee of the Year in 2006. Due to David's success at his job, he was chosen to travel to Washington, DC, to meet with Members of Congress to discuss employment for individuals with disabilities.</paragraph>
