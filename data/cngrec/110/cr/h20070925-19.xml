  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 220 years ago, 55 delegates assembled in Philadelphia, "to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The principles set forth by our Founding Fathers are still important today, and the Constitution and founding documents are essential to understand our history as a nation. They remain the bedrock of American society, and it is essential that we honor our Constitution as the embodiment of the freedoms we hold dear. That is why I introduced the U.S. History Resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution acknowledges the importance of promoting U.S. history in our schools and communities, with a particular focus on America's founding documents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the saying goes, those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. And to avoid this fate, we should repeat it often, but to repeat it in schools, to repeat it to our children so they understand where we came from so we can know where we are going. And that will promote a better America.</paragraph>
