  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a former teacher and as a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I am concerned by the fact that as the need for post-high school education increases in our country, so has the high price of attending college. Tuition fees at public universities have increased 41 percent after inflation since the year 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent report highlighted my home State of New Jersey as having the highest college costs in the Nation for 4-year public institutions. Including tuition and room and board, it costs an average of $17,515 to attend a public 4-year university or college in New Jersey, about $5,600 over the national average. Because of these skyrocketing costs, many students and their families must take out student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, thanks to the policies of the Bush administration in the past and of a Republican-controlled Congress, interest rates have increased as funding to college programs have been cut. Now this Congress has a chance to pursue a positive course by broadening college opportunities for all American students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Democratic bill coming before the House today, as part of the 100-hour agenda, will cut interest rates for the student loans, and, so, therefore, I ask, Mr. Speaker, that as our economy becomes more important day by day, it is important that we have a workforce that will be able to appreciate lower costs. This legislation will give more college-bound teens the ability to afford college, and that is why it should receive strong bipartisan support.</paragraph>
