    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am privileged today to honor an Idaho couple, Rick and Tina Betzer, who have been blessed with a heart and gift to minister to children. Rick and Tina are being honored today as Angels in Adoption by the Congressional Adoption Coalition. God grants each of us gifts; some of us use them, others don't, and the world is worse off for that neglect. Today I will share a different story--it is about two people who have chosen to use their gift to make an extraordinary  difference in the lives of others. Rick and Tina tell their story better than anyone. With the permission of the Chair, I will include their personal family statement as part of the Record. This is text from Rick and Tina Betzer's personal testimony:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We met in Jr. High and have been best friends since. We just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. We are privileged to be called mom and dad by 16 wonderful children. Our oldest 5 are biological and the youngest 11 have been adopted over the last 10 years. Our first born is Eric. He is now 31 years old married and has 2 step sons and 2 beautiful little girls. He owns his own tree-trimming business, and they raise quarter horses on their small farm in Chester Idaho. Next is our daughter Gina,  who is now 30 years old. She is married to Zac Clawson and they have 3 sons. Zac works for the Federal Government in Washington D.C. They live in Dumfries Virginia. Next is our daughter Amber. She is 28 years old. At this time she is living with us in Shelley and she works for Eastern Idaho Special services and is a transportation specialist for the homeless shelter in Idaho Falls. Our daughter Jessica is 22 years old and is married to Jacob Hackman. They live in Boise and are expecting their first child in June. Our daughter Brittney is 20 years old, graduated High School with honors, and is attending BYU Hawaii. We moved to Shelley in August 2004, from Ashton where we had been living for the past 15 years. While in Ashton, both Rick and I worked for the State of Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections as a Nurse and as a Therapy Technician. It was at the Juvenile correction center that we became aware of the need for committed foster parents. In the fall of 1990, we became licensed foster parents. Over the next 10 years, we fostered 38 children. On December 12, 1993, a case worker knocked on our door with a beautiful 2 year old boy in his arms. At first sight, we knew this little guy belonged to us. This was the first day of the rest of our lives. We adopted Shallon 3 years later. We thought we were a complete family, then, several years later, we were prompted to call LDS services to apply to adopt a special needs baby. A few months later we did not have a baby, but 3 active little kids. Breann, Daniel, and Courtney joined our family at the ages of 5, 6, and 7. At that point we were sure our family was complete. Again, several years went by and we could not get the thought out of our</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our children have changed our lives in many ways. Our world consists of therapists, special education and doctors. Our van could find its own way to Salt Lake and Primary Children's Hospital. We are on a first-name basis with doctors and nurses there and in Idaho Falls at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center. From February to November of last year, our children had 9 surgeries and countless procedures that enable them to function as best they can. We had 3 surgeries scheduled in September. Our  days are filled with medications, tube feedings, diapers, bottles, wheel chairs, leg braces, glasses, hearing aids and, above all, miracles. It is so humbling to watch these children overcome the obstacles in their lives. Nothing seems to stop them; they have more determination than all of us put together. We remember a Monday night a few years back when, as Tina sat in a chair in our living room holding our 5 year old daughter Zoe, Zoe reached over to the end table and picked up her bottle put the nipple in her mouth and took a drink. We cried. This was a little girl who doctors told us to walk away from, a little girl born with only half a brain, that specialists said would only eat and sleep the rest of her life. At the age of 3, she</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rick and Tina are more than deserving of the distinguished honor of 2007 Angels in Adoption. Their daily challenges are much more than most of us could imagine, let alone choose to experience at any time in our lives: they have chosen to become parents to children with disabilities including quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy, blindness, vision impairedness, hearing loss, auditory neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, fetal alcohol syndrome, reactive attachment disorder, attention deficit disorder  and genetic optic nerve atrophy. They are selfless examples of a loving commitment of time, energy and resources. Perhaps most difficult, but most rewarding as well, they have committed their hearts and emotions to children in need. The Betzers humble us with their actions they are the angels in their children's lives and examples to us all.</paragraph>
