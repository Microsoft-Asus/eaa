  <narrative>SOMALIA -- (Senate - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13618">S13618</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have come to this floor many times over the years to urge increased U.S. attention and resources to Somalia. Meanwhile, the United States and the international community at large have continued to respond sporadically and clumsily to the steady deterioration of Somalia's security, humanitarian, and political situations. In January, I said that we had only a very limited window to establish the conditions necessary for stability in Somalia and the volatile Horn of  Africa region, but I fear that opportunity may soon be lost. Events over the past few days suggest that strong but inclusive leadership is needed now if Somalia is to avoid the worst descent into chaos of its tumultuous history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend saw a massive setback in Somalia's security and humanitarian situation as a fresh outbreak of fighting which aid workers describe as the worst violence in months--forced tens of thousands more Somalis from their homes in Mogadishu. Most of these people are seeking refuge in communities whose coping capacities are already at the breaking point due to the strain of providing food, water, protection, shelter, and basic services to more than 300,000 existing internally displaced persons.  Some of the newly displaced have fled to areas where there is little or no access by humanitarian agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty of these aid organizations that are operating against all odds in Somalia released a statement yesterday highlighting the dramatic deterioration of the humanitarian situation and their increasing inability to effectively respond due to security and access constraints. They are calling on the international community and all parties to the present conflict to demonstrate a commitment to protect civilians, to facilitate the delivery of aid, and to respect humanitarian space and the safety  of humanitarian workers. I want to take this moment to honor the courageous individuals and their sponsoring organizations for their persistent service to the innocent civilians most affected by the ongoing instability in Somalia and to echo their appeal for concerted action to support their work and the broader objective of peace for Somalia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amidst this dark backdrop there is a glimmer of hope for progress. On Monday, the embattled Foreign Minister of Somalia's fragile transitional federal government, Ali Mohamed Gedi, resigned amid feverish political infighting. Since its formation 3 years ago, the TFG has suffered from a lack of public legitimacy due to its inability to effectively represent and provide security and services to the Somali people. The appointment of a new Prime Minister is likely to be the last chance for this transitional  government to restore some credibility and move forward with political reconciliation. I encourage all parties to seize this opportunity for progress towards a solution to the country's deepening crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, I warned that without concerted international and national action, Somalia could deteriorate into what it has been since the early 1990s--a haven for terrorists and warlords and a source of crippling instability in a  critical region. But as tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea rise once again, the ongoing humanitarian needs of civilians in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia reach international attention, and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  in Sudan stands on extremely fragile ground, I fear that our failure to protect civilians, defeat extremists, and build conditions for stability in Somalia could result in an even more disastrous outcome with consequences that extend far beyond the porous borders of this besieged nation. We cannot afford to squander this chance for progress towards peace.</paragraph>
