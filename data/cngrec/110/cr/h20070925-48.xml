  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for the goals and ideals of Campus Fire Safety Month, introduced by the representative from Ohio, Mrs. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES. Campus fire safety is an important issue for students all over the country. Since January of 2000, at least 113 young people have died in student housing fires. These unfortunate deaths may have been prevented by better education of fire safety measures and implementation of effective prevention systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own State of New Jersey, early on January 19, 2000, a fire killed three students and injured 58 others at Seton Hall University. Over 75 percent of these fatalities around the country have occurred in off-campus housing. It should be a priority to make sure that all students are aware of fire safety information, especially those students who do not live in on-campus housing. Fire safety training should be a continuing process so that our Nation's young people practice fire safety throughout  their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we send our Nation's students off to campuses this month to further their education, it is essential that they are in safe environments. Simple steps such as testing smoke detectors and having a working and accessible fire extinguisher can help keep our students safe. By recognizing September as Campus Fire Safety Month, this resolution will help bring awareness to such simple and critical measures to protect students from fire hazards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the knowledge and skills learned through fire safety training are invaluable for everyone. I would like to encourage administrators and municipalities across the country to provide educational programs to all students during September and throughout the school year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="95">H. Res. 95</bill>, a measure to support the goals and ideals of Campus Fire Safety Month. We passed a similar resolution last Congress promoting the establishment of September as Campus Fire Safety Month. Since that time, 31 States have issued proclamations recognizing September as Campus Fire Safety Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's college students should be able to live on campus with the confidence that they will be safe in their dorms, apartments or other housing. This measure will take a key step toward ensuring greater awareness of campus fire prevention and safety. I  thank my colleagues, Representatives TUBBS JONES and WHITFIELD, for taking the lead on this important topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are numerous examples nationwide that demonstrate a renewed commitment to campus fire safety. In my home State of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota system equips dorms with smoke detectors and is working now to ensure that residence halls and individual dormitory rooms have sprinkler systems. They use flame-resistant mattresses and other materials to provide students with the safest furniture available. In another example, New York State Office of Fire Prevention and Control trains  college officials and distributes materials that can be used in training college students on campus fire safety. These are just two examples of the good work being done at the State level to increase awareness of fire safety on college campuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today is sure to raise awareness even further. This is not the first time that campus safety has been discussed in the House. In the 109th Congress, we passed the College Access and Opportunity Act which endorsed an effort to ask colleges and universities to report annually on fire safety efforts. The report would include information such as a list of all student housing facilities and whether or not each is equipped with a sprinkler system or other fire safety system,  statistics on occurrences of fires and false alarms, information on various fire safety rules and regulations, and information about training provided to students, faculty and staff. Moreover, the measure asks schools to keep a publicly available log of all on-campus fires and false alarms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from Minnesota. May I ask if he has any further speakers?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Minnesota has said, we are safer, students in dormitories and off-campus housing are safer than they were 6, 8 years ago. We have learned things to do. In this case, we know what to do. The education should be carried forward. Designation of this awareness month will help in that educational effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support enthusiastically this measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="95">H. Res. 95</bill>, a bipartisan resolution that I, along with Mr. Whitfield, introduced to establish September as Campus Fire Safety Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation encourages administrators and municipalities across the country to provide educational programs to all students during September and throughout the school year on fire safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the resolution calls for evaluation of the level of fire safety being provided in both on- and off-campus student housing and taking the necessary steps to ensure fire-safe living environments through fire safety education, installation of fire suppression and detection systems and the development and enforcement of applicable codes relating to fire safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June, the Senate adopted a similar resolution, sponsored by Senator Joe Biden, that also encourages campus fire safety across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationwide, 113 people have been killed in student housing since January 2000, as identified by the Center for Campus Fire Safety, a nonprofit organization that compiles information on campus-related fires. Almost 80 percent of the fire fatalities have occurred in off-campus occupancies such as rented houses and apartments. Common factors in a number of these fires include: lack of automatic sprinklers, disabled smoke alarms, careless disposal of smoking materials, and alcohol consumption. According  to the center, April and May, followed by August and September, are the two most dangerous periods of time for student housing fire fatalities. So far 31 States have issued proclamations declaring September as Campus Fire Safety Month. Historically, September is one of the most fatal months for campus fires, but for the first time since 2000 there were no fatalities last September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="95">H. Res. 95</bill> is supported by the Center for Campus Fire Safety, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Congressional Fire Services Institute, National Fire Protection Association, International Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Fire Fighters, National Fire Sprinkler Association, International Code Council, Society of Fire Protection Engineers, International Association of Fire Marshals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past few Congresses I have introduced <bill type="h" number="642">H.R. 642</bill>, known as the College Fire and Prevention Act. This legislation would establish a demonstration incentive program within the Department of Education to promote installation of fire sprinkler systems, or other fire suppression or prevention technologies, in qualified student housing or dormitories, and for other purposes. The Congressional Fire Services Institute, the National Fire Sprinkler Association and the American Fire Sprinkler Association  have endorsed this fire prevention legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fire safety and prevention is an issue that needs to be addressed across this country. Over these few years we have seen many tragedies involving fire at colleges, places of business, entertainment venues and places of residence. We must begin to put in place suppression measures against fires and increase support and resources for our fire fighters to ensure that no more lives are lost to fires that could have been prevented. I am pleased to say that this institution adopted this resolution  in the 109th Congress and will do so again today. It is encouraging that we remain committed to bringing awareness to this issue in order to prevent more needless deaths of our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation so that we can increase awareness about this problem that affects us all.</paragraph>
