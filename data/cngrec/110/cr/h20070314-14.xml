    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to congratulate Manchester West High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Region 14 Applied Technology Center team from Peterborough, New Hampshire, on their victory at the regional FIRST Robotics Competition this past week in Manchester. FIRST is an acronym for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This remarkable program was developed in New Hampshire and has now spread to 1,500 high schools nationwide. It encourages young people to become actively involved with engineering and technology. FIRST brings innovative companies together with kids, teaching and inspiring them to pursue careers in advanced science. The brilliant students who participate actually build robots and then enter the robots in a series of competitions against the creations of other teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute the creativity and technological savvy of the winning teams. Congratulations to Manchester West and the Region 14 team and to FIRST on its aspirational mission. FIRST is helping inspire the next generation of technology innovators which our country depends on to remain competitive in our global economy.</paragraph>
