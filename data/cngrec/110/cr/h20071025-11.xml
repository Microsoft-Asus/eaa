    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of Schertz for being named one of the top 100 best places to live by Money Magazine. The city of Schertz was founded in 1843. It is the largest city in Guadalupe County, which encompasses part of my 28th Congressional District. Schertz is located between the areas of San Antonio and Austin but has retained its small town community feel, which was noted by Money Magazine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Schertz is the home to over 34,000 Texans. Part of the growth we have seen in this city is attributed to the city's vibrant economy, its schools, and the quality of life enjoyed by the residents and its leadership. It is clear why Schertz was named 40th in the top 100 best places to live by Money Magazine, and the State of Texas is ranked number 1 as the place to live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the city of Schertz for being named one of the top 100 best places to live by Money Magazine.</paragraph>
