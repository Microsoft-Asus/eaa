  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the cities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Portsmouth, Virginia, for the grand opening of a new complex that serves formerly homeless people. This is the first complex in the Nation that is financed and supported by more than one city. This complex will serve over 60 adults from our region who formerly lived in shelters, under bridges or on the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to these three cities who worked regionally and who worked together to address the very basic human need for shelter and providing other comprehensive services such as job counseling, mental health, substance abuse and drug-abuse treatment as well. Congratulations to them, and we hope other regions of the country will follow their example, and they will be a great model for our Nation.</paragraph>
