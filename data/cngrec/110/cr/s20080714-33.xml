    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ms. Marian Orfeo, director of Planning and Coordination with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, MWRA, on being named the new president of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, NACWA.</paragraph>
