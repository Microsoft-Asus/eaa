    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me respond to my good friend, the majority leader. We hope to be able to enter into an agreement to figure out how to dispose of the McCaskill and DeMint amendments on collective bargaining for TSA. There are also two district judges on the calendar who are noncontroversial whom we have no problem voting on this afternoon: Jarvey of Iowa and Lioi of Ohio. So in any event, we hope to be able to work all this out in the next few hours.</paragraph>
