    <paragraph>Mr. President, <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, introduced earlier today by Senators Reid of Nevada, McConnell, and others, is at the desk. I ask for its first reading.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will read the title of the bill for the first time.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will briefly comment on this action. It was a good occasion today. A press conference was held, led by myself and Senator McConnell, with a good bipartisan group of excellent Senators, regarding legislation that would improve America's competitiveness. It is important legislation. It has been worked on by a number of bipartisan Senators, including Senator Bingaman. The person who worked on it, from my perspective, more than anybody else is the distinguished  Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, as did Senator Ensign and Senator Lieberman. It is totally bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can, on a bipartisan basis, move it out of here in the near future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I might add something, this is a classic example of the Senate at its best. It is a significant bipartisan measure put together, as the majority leader indicated, with leadership on his side of the aisle and on our side by Senators Alexander, Domenici, and Stevens. This is a significant piece of legislation that we  hope to be able to move in the very near future.</paragraph>
