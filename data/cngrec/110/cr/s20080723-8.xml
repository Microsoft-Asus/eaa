  <narrative>ADVANCING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES -- (Senate - July 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7090">S7090</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me briefly say on the package of bills we have put together because of the obstruction of mainly one Senator, I was disappointed to read in this morning's press that a Republican Senator held most of these up, saying: I am going to do everything I can to stall this legislation, to prevent it from passing. He may be successful. If we don't get enough support from our Republican colleagues, that, in fact, will be the case. But I hope everyone understands that this has some extremely  important measures in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package we have put together has the Christopher and Dana Reeve paralysis legislation. It is so important. From the time we started moving forward on this legislation until today, they are both dead. One experienced the paralysis; the other experienced taking care of Superman, the man who was Superman and was injured in that very terrible accident where he was thrown from a horse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are trying to establish with this legislation a registry for people who have Lou Gehrig's disease. This is a terribly difficult disease. From the time one is diagnosed with it until you die is an average of 18 months. We will never, ever get ahold of this disease unless we pass what we are trying to do in this bundled legislation. We are simply trying to establish a registry so that for someone in Baltimore, MD, who has this disease--there are about 6,000 people who get this disease, and then  they die--someone in Las Vegas, someone in Louisville, someone in Chicago, there is a registry where physicians can put it all together, start computerizing it so that scientists trying to get ahold of this disease can look at the histories of these patients from around the country. That is the beginning of every successful scientific conclusion to these diseases, so that something can be done to alleviate the pain and suffering and hopefully arrive at a cure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are just two examples. There are many others. There are 40-odd bills. There is the Emmett Till bill which directs the Federal Government to do something about these unsolved murders. There is legislation in here dealing with child pornography.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope people don't look at this as taking away Senators' rights. This doesn't take away Senators' rights. I saw in this morning's press one Senator said: Well, I don't like to start taking away Senators' rights. In fact, it is just the opposite. When 98 Senators think something should happen, why should 1 or 2 Senators prevent for months and months our moving forward? We had to do it once before, bundling a bunch of bills from the Energy Committee that had already passed the House. These  bills have all passed the House of Representatives. They have all been reported out of the committees overwhelmingly. I would hope that when we get to this, it can end very quickly.</paragraph>
