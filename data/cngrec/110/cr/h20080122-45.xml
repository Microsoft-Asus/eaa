  <narrative>HONORING HRANT DINK -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H377]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. One year ago, Hrant Dink was brutally gunned down outside his office in Istanbul, Turkey by a self-proclaimed Turkish nationalist. The world lost a great human rights advocate and his tragic death was an attack on democratic ideals and values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dink was first charged with treason for upholding an irrefutable historical fact about the Armenian Genocide. He was convicted for his writings in 2005 for violating article 301, a law that makes it a crime to "insult" the Turkish state. This law continues today to be used to persecute, prosecute, and incarcerate those who attempt to exercise their universal human right of freedom of speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Turkey uses intimidation to deny its citizens their right to freedom of expression. It lobbies for its so-called rightful role in the international community and a place in the European Union. Yet it does not live up to democratic principles and standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hrant Dink is not the only one who has suffered from the consequences of this Turkish penal law. Anyone who refers to the events of 1915 for what they were, genocide, is targeted within Turkey. In addition, our own country is seeing the effects of this denial as Turkey continues to oppose human rights legislation condemning the Armenian Genocide here in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I remain deeply concerned with Turkey's failure to adopt standards and practices of both domestic and international conduct that would reverse and overturn the climate of intolerance, prejudice, and repression, as exemplified by article 301 of the Turkish penal code. It was this penal code that precipitated Mr. Dink's murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hrant Dink was guilty of nothing more than having the courage to defend freedom of the press and promote human rights and tolerance in Turkey. He was a man of conviction and principle who believed in democratic ideals and peaceful change. I urge Turkey to honor his name and repeal article 301.</paragraph>
