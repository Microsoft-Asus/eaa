  <narrative>MR. PRESIDENT, SIGN THE SCHIP BILL -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H15419]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, isn't this the season of giving? My colleagues, the Democratic majority has worked without stopping to provide funding for the health insurance of our children in America. Isn't it a shame that the minority and the administration want to be the scrooge of the season and deny millions of children health care in the Children's Health Insurance Plan; 966,000 children in the State of Texas, innocent children who cannot fend for themselves, now suffering because  we have a veto on the SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, isn't this a season of giving? I'm grateful that the Democrats prevailed on the AMT, giving middle-class taxpayers a bounty this holiday season, but who will care for the children?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. President, sign the SCHIP bill. Don't take away Christmas from millions of children here in America.</paragraph>
