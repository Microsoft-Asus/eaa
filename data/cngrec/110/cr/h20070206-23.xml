    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my district in the Tampa Bay area to herald the terrific achievement of our hometown hero, Tony Dungy. While Coach Dungy is the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl title, he is also a living testimony to faithful leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Coach Dungy's 11-year path to the Super Bowl title came through my hometown of Tampa, I think it is fair to say that everyone in the Tampa Bay area feels attached to his win, and we are proud to claim him as a resident. My friends and neighbors back home remember Coach Dungy as the former coach of the Buccaneers, who in that capacity brought a winning spirit and  gracious leadership to that team and our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We watched with pride Sunday when this man showed that nice guys can finish first. His team came from eight points behind, withstood the weather and won the game. Coach Dungy, as the first African American coach to win a Super Bowl, provides the perfect start to the month-long celebration of Black History Month. His victory follows the march of other men and women who have stood up for justice and opened doors for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to him and all that understand that perseverance and teamwork is the best answer to life's obstacles.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
