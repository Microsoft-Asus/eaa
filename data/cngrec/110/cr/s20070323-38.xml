    <paragraph>The distinguished Republican leader and I have talked on a number of occasions. We have a divided Government, with a Republican in the White House and a Democratic Senate and House. Divided Government oftentimes has allowed us to get a lot done. The Republican leader and I hope that is the case, and we will continue to try to work with the White House and accomplish things. We have been able to do a pretty good job the first 3 months. We have a lot more to do. Hopefully, what the Republican  leader and I have talked about will allow us to get a lot more done.</paragraph>
