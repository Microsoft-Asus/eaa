    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the 150th anniversary of Sacramento High School in Sacramento County, CA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 1, 1856, as the Gold Rush came to an end in California and miners migrated into newly formed cities, Sacramento High School opened its doors and began a long tradition of quality education. As the second oldest high school west of the Mississippi, Sacramento High School is a historical landmark and symbol of a quality educational institution in California's capital city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sac High, as it is locally known, has been the alma mater of a wide range of notable alumni including NBA great Kevin Johnson, Pulitzer Prize winner Herb Caen, and a number of distinguished Californians, including former California Governor Hiram Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, nearly 100 percent of the senior class will have the opportunity to pursue a post secondary education, 70 percent of whom have been accepted to a public or private 4-year college. Sac High's Dragons have also accumulated many championships in a variety of athletics over the years, including the recent San-Joaquin Division III Championship that both men's and women's basketball teams have won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the school and the community celebrate Sac High's sesquicentennial, I would like to congratulate the past and present students, faculty, and administrators who upheld Sacramento High School's traditions and campus pride for the last century and a half and wish them another 150 years of success.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
