    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, fiscal responsibility is the cornerstone of a strong economic plan, and House Republicans are dedicated to ensuring that American taxpayers are getting the best product for their money. Unfortunately, I can't say my Democrat colleagues feel the same way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are 3 weeks into fiscal year 2008, and for the first time in a long time Congress has not sent the President a single appropriations bill. One of these bills funds our veterans, and they deserve the benefits they were promised; yet politics has taken over the Democrat leadership, and their failure is costing veterans over $4 billion in new benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat majority also has failed to deliver on promised earmark transparency that would shed light on every earmark, and we're continuing to see abuses within the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At almost every opportunity, the Democrat leadership has increased spending and increased taxes to pay for these spending binges. It's time to get back on track to finding commonsense solutions and stop using taxpayer dollars like it's an unlimited source of money.</paragraph>
