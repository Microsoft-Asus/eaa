    <paragraph>Mr. President, on Monday, February 18, the United States will celebrate President's Day. President's Day takes on a particular significance this year, as the Nation is actively involved in the selection process for a new President. It is heartening to see the level of interest and participation in all of the Presidential campaign events and in the primaries and caucuses. It is a sign that Americans' faith in the basic processes of their Government is still strong, even as a recent poll  indicates that the public holds a very low opinion of the current President and of Congress. In a 1789 letter to Richard Price, Thomas Jefferson wrote that, "Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own Government. Whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied upon to set them to rights." I believe we are witnessing the truth of Thomas Jefferson's observation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As early as 1796, Americans were observing the birthday of our first, and still one of our greatest, Presidents, George Washington. According to various old style calendars, George Washington was born on either February 11 or February 22, 1732. On whichever date people preferred, President Washington's birthday was feted with "Birthnight Balls," speeches, and receptions. Here in the Senate, one of our most enduring traditions is the annual reading of Washington's 1796 Farewell Address by a  current Member of the Senate. This practice began in 1862, and became an annual event in 1893. Beginning in 1900, the Senator who read the address then signed his or her name and perhaps wrote a brief remark in a book maintained by the Secretary of the Senate. For the historically curious, both Washington's Farewell Address and a selection of the remarks from the book can be found on the Senate's Web site (www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/FarewellAddressBook.htm).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the 1865 assassination of President Lincoln, another revered President who was also born in February, similar memorial observations sprang up around the Nation. In 1865, both Houses of Congress gathered for a memorial address. President Lincoln's birthday became a legal holiday in several States, although it did not become a Federal holiday like President Washington's. However, in 1968, legislation was enacted to simplify the Federal holiday schedule. As a result, Washington's birthday  observance was moved to the third Monday in February, regardless of whether or not that day was February 22. Officially, this holiday is still known as Washington's Birthday, but it has become popularly known as President's Day to honor both Washington and Lincoln, as well as all who have served as President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why were President Washington and President Lincoln so widely and spontaneously revered by the public, even in the immediate aftermath of their deaths, before time had a chance to burnish their memories and fade their less enobling characteristics? Certainly, the great events that were shaped for the better by their decisions were a major factor. Both George Washington and Abraham Lincoln made a name for themselves as inspiring leaders of men and the Nation during pivotal wars in our Nation's  history. Both demonstrated true patriotism, a deep love of the Nation that was the prism through which they viewed all problems and made all decisions. Both men selflessly sacrificed their own personal lives to serve the Nation throughout their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of President's Day, I urge everyone to listen to or read Washington's Farewell Address and apply its wisdom to the Nation's current situation and to the decision each of us will make in November. A collaborative effort between George Washington and the authors of The Federalist Papers, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, Henry Cabot Lodge wrote of the Farewell Address that "..... no man ever left a nobler political testament." In it, Washington supported the Federal Government  as "a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence ....." warned against a party system that "..... serves to ..... agitate the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms ....." and "..... kindles the animosity of one ..... against another." He stressed the importance of religion and morality, famously warned against the entanglements of permanent foreign alliances, cautioned against an over-powerful military establishment as " ..... inauspicious to liberty ....." and urged the Nation to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington's experience and wisdom may serve us well as the true litmus test to apply to our prospective 44th President. Mr. President, I close with a poem by the author of The Life of Abraham Lincoln, Josiah Gilbert Holland (1819-1881) called "God, Give Us Men!" Penned before women had won the right to vote, it nonetheless resonates today and applies to anyone, man or woman, who would lead our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I never cease to be amazed at our senior colleague, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, for the great oratorical skills he has, the vast memory store he carries, of which we have just had an example that from memory he can recite poems and he can recite historical dates. He is such an inspiration to the rest of the Senators, and he is, indeed, the pillar upon which this Senate rests. Once again, we have been treated to the oratory of the great Senator  from the State of West Virginia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I deeply thank the able and distinguished Senator from the State of Florida in which I once lived. I thank him. I cherish his friendship. May he ever be one for whom the motto "E pluribus unum" will dwell in his heart.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, that is about the best admonition this Senator could have. E pluribus unum--out of many, one. I am grateful to the Senator from West Virginia for reminding not only me but the whole Senate of that duty, that responsibility, that obligation we all have.</paragraph>
