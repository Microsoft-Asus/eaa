  <narrative>COMMONSENSE SOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6580]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a basic rule of economics that when demand goes up, but supply remains stagnant, prices go up. That is the primary cause of the recent rise in gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy costs affect our transportation costs, our food costs and our national security. If there were a silver bullet, an alternative energy source that could replace oil tomorrow, we would all be for it. But there isn't. So while we are working with oil, it makes economic and national security sense to reduce our dependence on foreign imports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to invest in alternative energy, good. So do we. If they want to promote conservation, good. So do we. But if they continue to stand in the way of opening up new areas right here at home for oil and natural gas exploration, then they will stand alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans are ready to act because Americans want an all-of-the-above energy policy. When will House Democrats stand with the American people, rather than in their way?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops. We will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
