  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our troops are returning from all over the world having suffered from many wounds, but many of the wounds that they're suffering from are not visible to the naked eye. Those wounds are psychological wounds. And tragically, our veterans system is not equipped, as we've seen this last week from a series by the Washington Post, to address many of those concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation needs to be better prepared to address the psychological and emotional wounds that our veterans are facing. And tragically, this country has not come to grips with the mental health crisis that even our own citizens face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress needs to address this problem. It needs to address it within the Veterans Administration, and it needs to address it for this country by passing mental health parity and by making sure that we address PTSD for our veterans, making sure we have oversight of the VA, and making sure that they address the needs of our veterans, both visible and invisible wounds of our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
