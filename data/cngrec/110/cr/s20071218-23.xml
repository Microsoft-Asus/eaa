    <paragraph>Mr. President, on Monday, in Hocking County--a small-town, rural county in southeast Ohio--residents began forming a line at the Smith Chapel United Methodist Church Pantry before dawn. By 8:30, when volunteers began distributing food, the line of cars stretched for more than a mile and a half. By early afternoon, more than 2,000 residents had received food. That is over 7 percent of the local population. Mr. President, 1 out of 14 people in this county had received food from this  food pantry. Eight years ago, the same pantry was serving 17 families a month. Two thousand people in one day; 17 families for the whole month 8 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Freestore Foodbank in Cincinnati, OH, has seen a 52-percent increase in demand this year. Many of these new patrons are working people. They are working minimum-wage jobs. Some hold two jobs. They are not just the homeless. They are not just the dispossessed. They are all kinds of people who have had a series of bad luck in the last several months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With food prices going up, fuel prices going up, wages stagnating, and subprime foreclosures continuing to hit home, working middle-class Americans are finding it difficult to find room in their budgets for food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More Americans in need; less food available--the result is far too much human suffering. Think of this. In the wealthiest Nation in the world, people are waiting in line for a subsistence level of food, and some of them are not even receiving that. The men and women and children waiting in line for food are men and women and children you have passed on the street--mothers and fathers trying to feed their kids, children too proud to admit there is no lunch money in their pocket, no food in the  refrigerator, no holiday meals ahead; no food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grandmothers raising their grandchildren, living on fixed incomes, relying--because they have no choice but to rely--on food pantries, on food donations, on food banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unemployed, the sick, the aged, the homeless, the mentally ill. And in Hocking County, 1 out of 14 people went to one food bank on 1 day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are people who live in the communities that all of us serve. Food banks in Ohio, in Montana, Michigan, Illinois, Arizona, New York, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Rhode Island and in every State of the Union are underfunded and overextended. Food banks too often are rationing rations, trying to prevent children and families from going hungry over the holidays. In Lorain, OH, my hometown, the Salvation Army Food Pantry ran out of food completely and was forced to close temporarily. The society  of St. Vincent de Paul Food Pantry in Cincinnati has been forced to give families 3 or 4 days of food instead of the customary 6 or 7 days of food when people come to see them. In Athens County, OH, earlier this month, the director of the Family and Friends</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why earlier last week I offered legislation to act to alleviate the current food shortage. That is why I want to see us include $40 million in emergency food aid for food pantries across my State and across the country. I appreciate the leadership of Senator Durbin and Majority Leader Reid in wanting to include this at the next opportunity come January to get this $40 million out to the States, out to churches and food banks and food pantries so that the 1 out of 14  people in Hocking County and people in need all over this country can get the assistance we can afford to give them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the senior Senator from Illinois.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to ask through the Chair--I want to first thank the Senator from Ohio for his leadership on this issue. He is new to the Senate but not new to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Times have changed in America, and not for the better when it comes to food pantries. People need help. I just this Sunday visited the Greater Chicago Food Depository and learned that there is an 11-percent increase over last year in the number of people coming into food pantries served in the greater Chicagoland area, and most of them have jobs. These are people who, when they fill up the gas tank and need another $20 to fill the tank, realize they are not going to have enough money to buy food  for their children that they planned on buying, and they make a stop at the food pantry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio whether he is familiar with Second Harvest, which is a major national organization that involves itself in the processing of contributions from private industry and from the Federal Government into food pantries, and whether he has any experience in dealing with the Second Harvest food pantries in his area or other food pantries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last point I would like to make is that we were told on Sunday that people who care, particularly during this holiday season, should go to secondharvest.org, but find their local pantry, find where they can drop off food, volunteer for an hour, make a donation, do something that will make you feel good about yourself this holiday season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio whether he has been contacted by these agencies dealing with Second Harvest.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Illinois for his work on food issues and on other issues, including everything from subprime to minimum wage and all issues where we can play a role in improving the lives of people who, as the Senator from Illinois said, are working, in most cases, full-time jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second Harvest is one of the great organizations in this country--in Illinois, in Ohio, in Nevada, and in Vermont, all over this country. I urge people, understanding that Second Harvest is not getting the donations they used to get, they are not getting enough help from the Government, they are not getting as much from supermarkets and from businesses as they got before, and they, frankly, are not getting as many charitable donations because people who gave before sometimes are in need themselves  because it is often people who don't make a lot of money who are the most generous with their money and with their assistance, to plea to people in our States, businesses, individuals who are as lucky as we are in this Chamber, to help Second Harvest, to go on Web sites and look in the yellow pages and look around their communities where they can help people so that this will actually make a difference. So I thank the Senator from Illinois for his interest.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I mentioned to my friend from Ohio a fact that I just heard. I hope it is wrong, but if it is wrong, it is not much wrong. The average income of people who vote in America today is $70,000 a year. I am very happy we have people who have a little--people of means who are voting, but the reason I mention that is the last two issues that have been brought before the Senate, one dealing with LIHEAP--that is, how people stay warm in the wintertime; that was by the Senator  from Vermont, Mr. Sanders--and now the Senator from Ohio is talking about food banks. In Nevada, 25 percent of the homeless are veterans, and we have a very difficult problem, especially in Las Vegas. The weather is warm most of the time. We have people who are homeless there who are destitute. Food banks is the difference between being very hungry and having something to eat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, at one time, in disguise, spent 2 days with the homeless. It was a number of years ago that I did that, but it is something I will never forget. People are not there because they want to be. They are not there because they are lazy. There are some who are alcoholics, and there are some who have drug problems, there is no question about that. But there are so many of these people who have emotional problems who have no community health centers where they can go, so they are just down and out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All the Senator from Ohio is saying is that food banks, the places where the poorest of the poor go to get a meal, don't have food. I want the attention to be directed to the last two things we have tried to work on: keeping people warm in the wintertime and helping people so they are not starving. So I appreciate this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people who are cold in the wintertime don't have people to come and lobby for them. People who are homeless don't have people  here lobbying for them, coming in their limousines and parking over on Constitution Avenue, and sometimes they are in their Gucci shoes and they have to walk all the way across half a block to come and lobby for some of the tax breaks they want. For people who are hungry and people who are cold, that isn't the case. So I appreciate very much the Senator from Ohio bringing to the attention of the Senate something that needs to be done.</paragraph>
