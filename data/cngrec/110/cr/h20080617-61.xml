  <narrative>STOP-LOSS POLICY IS A BREACH OF TRUST -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5460]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for over 5 years, the American people have seen the administration break one promise after another when it comes to Iraq. Now, another promise is being broken. This time, it has to do with the stop-loss policy, a policy that forces soldiers to stay in the military when their unit deploys to Iraq within 90 days of the end of the soldiers' enlistment period. Stop-loss means that troops must continue to serve even when their enlistment period has expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January 2007, Secretary of Defense Gates ordered the military services to limit the number of stop-loss troops. For a while, in fact, the order seemed to be working. The number of troops affected by the policy dropped to about 8,500. However, now the number is back up to 11,000, and Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said just last week that the number of stop-loss troops would continue to rise over the next couple of years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stop-loss soldiers are forced to serve an average of over 6 months more than they signed up for. This creates enormous stress, Madam Speaker, and it also creates great strain on the soldiers and on their families. The multiple deployments that many of our troops face make the hardship even worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stop-loss policy is actually a backdoor draft, but it is even worse than that. It is a breach of trust with the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country. They deserve a lot better treatment and a lot more respect than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stop-loss policy is causing a great deal of suffering, but our troops and veterans are suffering in many other ways as well. It is easy for some of us to convince ourselves that everything is just hunky-dory with our troops now because Iraq has disappeared from our television screens. But while the conflict may have disappeared from television, it has not disappeared from the lives of our troops and from the lives of their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 300,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Rand Corporation. That is one in five who have served, and an additional 320,000 have sustained head injuries. The great majority of these injuries were sustained in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only half of those suffering from depression or post-traumatic stress have sought treatment actually because many fear that it will harm their military careers. And half of those who have received treatment have gotten only "minimally adequate" treatment. That, too, is according to Rand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there was also a very disturbing report in the press today that the Veterans Administration has tested drugs on veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress without telling them about the possible mental side effects. Congress must conduct a full investigation of that report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most tragically, suicides among members of the Army have been rising steadily during the occupation. In 2007, 150 soldiers committed suicide, Mr. Speaker, compared with 67 in 2004. About a quarter of the deaths occurred in Iraq. And an average of five U.S. soldiers attempted suicide every day in the year 2007. Before the occupation, the number was one per day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, not everyone is being hurt by the occupation. Some people are doing quite well, thank you, and they've got the money to prove it. Chairman Waxman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has asked the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to investigate "potentially thousands of criminal cases involving fraudulent contracts in Iraq." Hundreds of millions of dollars could be involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has already reported that millions of dollars in contracts have been wasted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must hold the administration accountable for every dollar spent in Iraq. We must do everything we can to give our veterans the best possible care. We cannot allow war profiteering to go on while our injured veterans lack the care that they need.</paragraph>
