  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to provide some comments for the RECORD with respect to <bill type="sr" number="580">S. Res. 580</bill>. This resolution expresses the sense of the Senate on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I have agreed to cosponsor <bill type="sr" number="580">S. Res. 580</bill>, introduced by Senator Bayh, Senator Thune, and Senator Smith. This resolution makes clear the need to take economic, political, and diplomatic action to prevent Iran from acquiring the capability to develop nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="sr" number="580">S. Res. 580</bill> sends an important message, and I support the policy reflected in this resolution. I did work with the authors of the resolution, however, to come to an agreement on a few minor changes to the resolution. For example, the word "importation" should be replaced with the word "exportation" on page 6. That's a technical change. I also wanted to see the word "banning" replaced with the phrase "encouraging foreign governments to ban."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, my staff and I have worked with Senator Bayh and his staff to address these two concerns, and he's graciously agreed to work toward incorporating these changes prior to any action by the Senate. On the basis of that understanding, I have agreed to cosponsor <bill type="sr" number="580">S. Res. 580</bill>.</paragraph>
