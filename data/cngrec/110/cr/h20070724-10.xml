    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend Reverend Galen Hahn, who is serving as guest chaplain for the House of Representatives today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Hahn is the pastor of the Evangelical United Church of Christ, located in my district in Portsmouth, Ohio. Reverend Galen Hahn graduated from Frederick High School in Maryland. As a high school student, Reverend Hahn led youth in contributing to the building of the President John F. Kennedy Library and served as an usher on the Presidential Reviewing Stand of Lyndon B. Johnson. After high school Reverend Hahn went on to graduate from Yale Divinity School in Connecticut and was ordained  a minister in the United Church of Christ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Hahn has pastored throughout the country. He has offered ordained Christian service to the Moravian Church and the United Methodist Church in North Carolina and started a Montessori preschool in Illinois, which continues to this day. He has led scouts in worship on the battlefields of Monocacy, Antietam, and Gettysburg, and has held a memorial service at the  grave site of President George Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Galen's wife Sandy has led worship at Camp David for President and Mrs. George Herbert Walker Bush. Today Galen and Sandy are celebrating their 36th wedding anniversary as well as their oldest daughter Whitney's 30th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Hahn has invested his life's energy in service to God and country and the oneness of these two entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in welcoming Reverend Galen Hahn to the House of Representatives as our guest chaplain.</paragraph>
