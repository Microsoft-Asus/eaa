  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I rise to recognize three Arkansans who served our country with dignity and honor and gave their lives to our country in Iraq: MAJ Michael Taylor, 1SG Tom Warren, and Army SFC John Gary Brown. They will be remembered by their friends and family as men who lived lives full of passion and love. Their Nation will remember them as men who dedicated themselves to protection of our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael Taylor's father-in-law described him as "a good guy" with a personality that attracted everyone to him since his childhood days in North Little Rock. As a National Guardsman, who worked at the Veterans' Administration, he soon learned that his true passion was in flying. He had spent a lot of time working with computers, and the relationship between modern helicopters and computers gave him a leg up when it came time to enter flight school. He retired from the VA to become a pilot with  the Arkansas National Guard flying Black Hawk helicopters. Taylor eventually reached the Bravo Company's top position and commanded the company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second member of the flight team was First Sergeant Tom Warren. 1st Sgt. Warren grew up in Jacksonville, AR, near Camp Robinson. He attended North Little Rock High School in 1976 and married his wife Doris on January 17, 1983. He raised five children and throughout his life was very active in church. He was a Mason, including being past master at his lodge in Levy, which was the same position his father had held. He also served as deacon at Lifehouse Christian Fellowship, where he was an  active member. Outside of church, Warren loved to golf, but nothing besides his family could match his love for aviation. Warren reached the position of first sergeant, making him the top ranked enlisted soldier in the company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gary Brown hailed from the small town of Nashville, AR. He was born and raised there and attended Nashville High School, where he was on the track team. He graduated in 1982 and spent a year at Ouachita Baptist University. During his time in Little Rock, he was a member of Agape Church and was active in the church's children's bus ministry and men's Bible study. His twin brother said that everything Brown did in his life meant something to him, whether it was easy or hard, and he could always  be found with a smile on his face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To him, serving his country meant something, and he served for 20 years in the National Guard. Most recently Brown was the crew chief of the Arkansas National Guard's 77th Aviation Brigade. He pursued perfection and was truly dedicated to his job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that First Sergeant Warren flew was what he called a limousine service. They ferried others around Iraq as part of "Task Force Dragon," but they became known as the "Catfish Air." Serving their fellow soldiers, these men risked their lives every day to make sure people got to and from dangerous areas as safely as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically these three men's lives intertwined on January 20, 2007, when their helicopter crashed in the area northeast of Baghdad in one of the deadliest moments of the war for our National Guard. I offer my condolences to their families, and I pray that they can find comfort in the knowledge that these three men died serving others and doing what they loved on behalf of a grateful Nation. My thoughts and prayers go out to the many people whose lives were touched by these men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SPECIALIST JEREMY STACEY &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PRIVATE FIRST CLASS BRUCE SALAZAR</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with great sadness that I also rise to honor two young men with Arkansas ties who died on back-to-back days during the July 4 recess. Specialist Jeremy L. Stacey was killed on July 5 by a roadside bomb in Baghdad, and Army PFC  Bruce Salazar Jr., was killed on July 6 by an improvised explosive device, IED, in Muhammad Sath, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Stacey spent a large portion of his life growing up in Amarillo, TX, and later moved with his mother, Betty Click, to Bismarck, AR, where he graduated from Bismarck High School in 2003. Shortly after graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Stacey was remembered by those in Bismarck as a great guy that everyone loved. He had been called a prankster with a quick wit by those who knew him well, and his death has been devastating for his family and the Bismarck community. Specialist Stacey was the first fatality of the Bismarck graduates serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Stacey was an M1 armor crewman with the 1st Cavalry Division stationed in Fort Bliss, TX, and had received the National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon. He was posthumously appointed to the rank of corporal and awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his graduation in Arkansas, Stacey's mother moved to Los Chavez, NM, and although he reenlisted in December for another 3-year term, he talked of moving to New Mexico to be near his mother once his service was complete. A talented writer who wrote fiction, Stacey also dreamed of going to college one day. He is survived by his mother and four sisters: Jessica Stacey, Shaila Stacey, Lisa Close, and Erica Close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just one day after Specialist Stacey was killed, Arkansas lost another one of its sons when Army PFC Bruce Salazar was killed. Salazar moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, in 2003 when he followed his best friend Ronnie Jacques from Davis, CA, to Northwest Arkansas. Salazar's father, Bruce Salazar Sr., lives in Springdale, and the younger Salazar worked in Springdale while completing his general equivalency degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 24-year-old joined the Army and planned on being a career solider, according to his mother and his friend. After the war, Salazar planned on helping his mother, Suzie Ruiz of Modesto, CA, buy a house, and he looked forward to moving to Florida. His mother remembered him as a good kid who was always there when she needed him. He was an avid baseball fan and wanted to be a fighter pilot. A few weeks before his death, Salazar spoke to his mom about family and friends and asked for a baseball  glove to play catch. Ms. Ruiz mailed the glove and a book on becoming a pilot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private First Class Salazar was an infantryman with the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division based in Fort Stewart, GA. He is survived by his mother Suzy father Bruce sister Alicia Salazar and four half-sisters in Southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The deaths of these two young men, like the thousands who have already given their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan, touch many families and many communities across our State and throughout this great land. Our Nation is grateful for their service, and in the days and weeks ahead, our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I also wish to remember a young Arkansan who paid the ultimate sacrifice by giving his life for our freedom in Iraq earlier this year, CPL Zachary Baker. Coporal Baker was 24 years old and is survived by his wife Christina and seven-year-old son Andrew, as well as his mother, father, brother, sister, and other relatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known affectionately to his family as "Bubba," Baker was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq. He was originally sent to Iraq in 2005 and volunteered to go back after completing that tour. His family described him as a good Christian man who thought about others before himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was killed with five other members of the First Cavalry Division based out of Fort Hood, TX, when a roadside bomb exploded near the Bradley fighting vehicle they were in. His team was responding to a helicopter that Iraqi insurgents shot down north of Baghdad after two crew members radioed for help. Both crew members died in the crash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my deepest sympathy to his family. My thoughts and prayers, as well as those of so many Arkansans, are with you during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, Arkansas lost a fine young American this past year when SSG Justin Estes of Sims was killed while trying to assist a wounded soldier near Samarra, Iraq. According to reports, Sergeant Estes was in the third vehicle of a convoy when another vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device, IED. Without regard for himself, Sergeant Estes left his vehicle and rushed to pull an injured comrade out of the burning vehicle. He began administering first aid to the wounded soldier  when another IED detonated. He died in the arms of a second soldier from the explosion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Estes was remembered as a fine soldier, "The Best of the Best," who put others before himself. He was serving his second tour for the 82nd Airborne and was set to return to the United States after his first tour. However, he gave his slot to a fellow soldier so that he could see his newborn son. Family and friends also recalled his fun-loving spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Estes was awarded three medals: the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He is survived by his parents, Don and Kathy Estes of Kentucky and John and Diane Salyers of Sims. He also has two older sisters, Norma and Kelli, in addition to other family. My thoughts and prayers go out to the Estes family during this trying time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with great sadness that I also rise today to pay tribute to a Arkansan who served his country with honor, SPC Erich S. Smallwood of Trumann, AR. Specialist Smallwood died on May 26, 2007, from injuries suffered when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle outside of Balad, Iraq. Erich was a member of Company B of the 87th Troop Command's 875th Engineer Battalion based in Marked Tree, AR, and served with the battalion's Company A based in Jonesboro, AR.  He was the first loss for the 875th during Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2002 graduate of Trumann High School, Smallwood was a beloved member of his community. He was selected "Mr. Trumann High School" by his classmates and was a good athlete who played football, baseball, and ran track for THS. He was also selected "Most Involved" his senior year in high school and was a member of Future Farmers of America and the Spanish Club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days following his death, friends and loved one remembered Smallwood for the person he was and the examples he set. In an interview in the Trumann Democrat, his high school principal, Jim Montgomery, recalled that Specialist Smallwood had a great sense of humor. "He liked to kid around, but he never got into any trouble. . . He was always doing something to make people laugh . . . He was a good student and a good person."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At his funeral on June 4, his brother-in-law, Jon Redman of Jonesboro, noted that he was an inspiration to others. "He was a special kind of person. He always had that smile on his face. . . He was the greatest brother anyone could have. He was a friend to many people and never met a stranger. He was the heart and soul of his unit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arkansas National Guard Adjutant GEN William B. Wofford remembered him as "a soldier both inside and outside the wire. He wanted to be an encouragement to someone. He was a true patriot, was intelligent, and loved his fellow soldiers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a Memorial Day service in Trumann, just 2 days after his passing, Mayor Sheila Walters read a proclamation recognizing the sacrifice of Specialist Smallwood. It read: "We honor all soldiers and their commitments to this great country by their legacy of patriotism and sacrifice. We honor our very own Erich Smallwood for giving his life in the cause of freedom. He is one of the many heroes who have protected and inspired us all."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, Specialist Smallwood was a unique person who paid the ultimate sacrifice in serving his country and protecting our freedoms. My thoughts and prayers are with his fiancee, Amanda; father, James; mother, Pamela; sister, Terah;  brother J.T., who is also currently serving in Iraq; and the rest of the Smallwood family during this trying time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="SERGEANT ROBB ROLFING">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I mourn the loss and celebrate the life of Rob Rolfing. Robb died on June 30 while engaging enemy insurgents in Baghdad. He was the 23rd South Dakotan to make the ultimate sacrifice in the war on terror. My deepest sympathies go out to Robb's family, in particular, his mother Margie, his father Rex, his brother TJ, and his sister Tiffany. With Robb's tragic death, South Dakota has lost one of its finest sons and the Army has lost a dedicated professional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robb was from Sioux Falls and graduated from O'Gorman High School in 1996. His love of science and ingenuity was inspired by television's MacGyver. Those who remember Robb from high school like to recount how Robb was never without duct tape or a Swiss Army knife. Another of their favorite stories is how Robb rigged up a makeshift parachute for his graduation cap so that when he threw it in the air it glided back down to the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Robb grew it was clear that he was a gifted scholar, athlete, leader, and coach. He dedicated himself to the pursuit of excellence in every aspect of his life. He was a passionate soccer player who excelled on and off the field at Vassar College. He finished his collegiate career with a degree in Astrophysics and was twice named the captain of the Vassar soccer team, scored the winning goal to advance his team to Vassar's first ever national tournament, and was the team's second all-time leader  in goals, assists, and points. Following graduation from college, Robb coached soccer at Rollins College in Florida and Curry College in Massachusetts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001, Robb pursued another of his dreams. He joined the U.S. Army and became a member of the Green Berets, the Army's elite experts in unconventional warfare. Based on Robb's dedication to excellence and his mechanical ingenuity it came as no surprise that Robb served as the special forces engineer for his unit, Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, airborne. Special forces engineers are skilled at construction projects,  building field fortifications, and using explosive demolitions. Looking back over Robb's life, it seems that his whole experience was designed to culminate in gaining the coveted Army Green Beret that is recognized the world over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Green Berets are commonly called quiet professionals and referred to as a special breed of man. Robb was both these things and truly lived the Green Beret motto, De Oppresso Liber, To Liberate the Oppressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I truly mourn the loss of SGT Robb Rolfing and I extend my thoughts, prayers, and best wishes to his family, friends, and loved ones.</paragraph>
