    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 5 legislative days during which Members may revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on House Resolution 1463 into the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the benefits of service learning as a teaching strategy and to support the goals of the National Learn and Serve Challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Service learning is an educational model that can be used from kindergarten to the university level across all subjects and disciplines. More than just community service, service learning challenges students to apply their classroom lessons by asking them to investigate a problem in their community, plan solutions, take action through service, and then reflect on their experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By integrating classroom learning with real-world challenges in the community, service learning can make school assignments come alive for our students. At the same time, we are also encouraging our young people to help improve our local neighborhoods. Studies have shown a connection between service learning and higher academic achievement, enhanced classroom engagement, increased attendance, better problem solving skills, and a deeper understanding of cognitive complexities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research also suggests that students involved in service-learning opportunities build self-confidence, leadership skills, and increase their tolerance of others. This all makes service learning a successful strategy in reducing negative behaviors such as those that lead to dropping out, arrest, or unintended pregnancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, service learning promotes involvement in our democracy, development of strong ethics, and a sense of social responsibilities. For example, studies have shown that high school students that participated in service learning are more likely to vote 15 years after their experience than those that did not participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, students who are exposed to service learning build important social and personal skills. Service learning is an onramp to civic engagement for a lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to call attention to the many benefits of service learning, the National Learn and Serve Challenge will take place October 6-12. This week-long nationwide celebration of service will raise awareness of service learning and foster collaborative partnerships between local schools, institutions of higher education, and their surrounding communities. The organization has set an ambitious goal of having 5 million college students and 50 percent of K-12 schools engaged in meaningful service  by 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for the National Learn and Serve Challenge, and I encourage more schools to take advantage of the many benefits service learning can have on our students and our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 1463 which recognizes the benefits of service learning as a teaching strategy to effectively engage youth in the community and classroom, and it supports the goals of the National Learn and Serve Challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young Americans, from kindergartners to college students, have the desire, power, and ability to make a real difference in their communities. Service learning offers a unique opportunity for them to get involved in a concrete way by integrating community service projects with classroom learning. It enriches the learning experience, teaches civic responsibility, and strengthens communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research has shown that service-learning programs can have positive  impacts on youth in three general areas: academic engagement and achievement; civic attitudes and behaviors; and social and personal skills. The studies also demonstrate that students gain the maximum benefit when their service-learning experience includes a direct tie to the curriculum, planning, and design of service projects by students, structured reflection on the service experience  in the classroom, and continuity of service for at least one semester.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Service-learning programs work. They meet the Nation's needs by putting the talents and energies of America's youth to work solving real issues in their communities such as homelessness, elderly care, and illiteracy. In addition, students' lives are enriched through service learning as they become engaged in their own educational process. We see the results and benefits of the work they do, and they become civic-minded Americans who make a contribution to the communities in which they live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Learn and Service America is the only Federally funded program dedicated to service learning and enables over 1.5 million students to make meaningful contributions to their community while building academic and civic skills. Through its annual week-long National Learn and Serve Challenge, the program spotlights the value of service learning to youth, schools, and communities and instills an ethic of lifelong community service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the recent natural disasters that have stricken our Nation, it is important that young people are encouraged to incorporate service into their lives and make a difference in their community and country. The intangible benefits alone--such as pride, satisfaction, and accomplishment--are worthwhile reasons to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I applaud the efforts of Learn and Serve America and the millions of dedicated youth volunteers for their service, and I would like to encourage all Americans to work together so we can more effectively meet the pressing needs facing our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
