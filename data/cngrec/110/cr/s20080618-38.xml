    <paragraph>Madam President, as this Saturday marks the official beginning of summer, I rise to recognize a small nonprofit from my home State of Maine that has championed the activities that have made the State a long-time destination for seasonal travel and exploration. Since 2005, the Greenland Point Center, Inc., on Long Lake in Princeton, has served to educate both youth and adults on issues of conservation and leadership while promoting outdoor activities and learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally founded in 1978, the Greenland Point Center previously operated under the auspices of the University of Maine at Machias. Facing closure in 2004, community members and conservation groups from around the state rallied behind it, purchasing the land that housed the camp from the University and revitalizing the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the Greenland Point Center, which has become a perennial favorite for Mainers and their families, hosts a series of camps designed to allow children and families to explore the natural world and grow as individuals. At the same time, the center works to empower campers by teaching them many of the vital safety skills that are imperative to the successful enjoyment of this Nation's natural resources. The center's exciting camp programs range from the more traditional Wet 'N' Wild Camp, where  campers learn to canoe and sail, to the Downeast Teen Leadership Camp, where middle-school students from Maine's Washington County have an opportunity to learn the skills necessary to help them lead healthy lifestyles as they progress through the often challenging</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The firm has a deep commitment to making the opportunities that it offers available to all youth, regardless of their financial situation. To promote that goal, the Greenland Point Center works tirelessly to provide scholarships for financially disadvantaged individuals who wish to experience the natural wonders of the State of Maine. Of particular note, each year's Maine Moose Permit Auction raises scholarship money for the Center, affording numerous youngsters from across the State the chance  to take part in discovering Maine's beautiful surroundings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the Greenland Point Center is an active participant in the nationwide "Hooked on Fishing--Not On Drugs" program. Founded by the Future Fisherman Foundation and funded through the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, "Hooked on Fishing--Not On Drugs" seeks to keep Maine's youth off drugs by teaching angling skills, conservation efforts, and social skills, preserving proud traditions while promoting a healthy way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Maine has long been a proud bastion of outdoor adventure and protecting the environment. The Greenland Point Center has served to help maintain the appreciation of nature and all of its wonder. Coupled with lessons in healthy physical, mental, and emotional lifestyles, the Greenland Point Center has served the youth of Maine and the Nation while shaping a new generation of leaders and entrepreneurs. I congratulate the Greenland Point Center on its past achievements and wish everyone  involved success as the Center continues to nurture America's youth.</paragraph>
