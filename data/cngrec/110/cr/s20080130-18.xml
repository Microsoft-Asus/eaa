  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - January 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="478">S478</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there will be no rollcall votes tonight. We will see what we can do tomorrow to come to some conclusion on the stimulus package, at least get on the road to how we are going to have some votes. And we will have some votes; it is just a question of when we will have them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On FISA, we thought we had it worked out a few minutes ago, but it came "unworked." So we are going to continue to see what we can do. I have told Senator McConnell we are doing our very best to wrap that up so we can have agreement. But an agreement is two sided. It is not just us. We think we have a way to complete that so we can finish our work on it, but it is a work in progress. I thought we had it done a few minutes ago, but it didn't work out that way. So we will see what we  can do tomorrow on these issues, but there will be no votes tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell.) Without objection, it is so ordered.</paragraph>
