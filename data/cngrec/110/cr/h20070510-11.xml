  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it seems that every year as we close in on Memorial Day, gas prices sky-rocket to new record highs. Unfortunately, this year there is no exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 6 years under Republican leadership, Congress has failed to enact a comprehensive energy strategy needed to help stabilize the price of gas and make America more energy independent. Under the Republican leadership, energy policy was little more than corporate welfare, handing over billions of dollars in tax breaks to oil companies and gas companies experiencing record profits. As a result of those policies, American families are paying a higher price every time they go to the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the new leadership, this House has already supported a rollback of those multi-billion dollar taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies so that we can invest in efficiency and renewable forms of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is time to help the working families struggle to pay the prices at the pump. We must bring down prices and make America energy independent. With a comprehensive energy policy we can and should and will accomplish this goal.</paragraph>
