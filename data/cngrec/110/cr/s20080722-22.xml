    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community in North Dakota that recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. On July 12 and 13, the residents of Guelph gathered to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guelph is located in Dickey County in southeastern North Dakota. It was founded in 1886 as a station for the Great Northern Rail Road. The post office was established on March 8, 1887, and its postmaster, Silas R. Dales, named the town for his hometown of Guelph, Ontario.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although its population is small, Guelph is a popular destination because of its proximity to the James River for recreational boating and fishing. In addition, there are eight farms in the community that have been in the same families for 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The celebratory events on July 12 included a performance by the Guelph Community Band and Chorus, an all-school reunion, children's games, pony rides, a Shine and Show classic car/collectible vehicle show, a banquet and a dance. Activities for July 13 included a turkey barbeque, children's games and a tractor pull. Also, the anniversary committee created memorabilia rooms representing the former Guelph school classes, and the town of Guelph. Video presentations of the community history and past  celebrations were available for viewing throughout the weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Guelph, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Guelph and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. Communities such as Guelph have helped shape this Nation into what it is today, which is why this community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
