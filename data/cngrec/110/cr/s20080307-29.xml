  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of Miss Eve Carson, student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Miss Carson's life was tragically cut short on Wednesday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I send my deepest condolences to Eve's family, the Chapel Hill community, and all those who came to know of her service and compassion for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eve Marie Carson was born to Bob Carson and Teresa Bethke in Athens, Georgia, on November 19, 1985. She attended Clarke Central High School, where she served as student body president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eve enrolled at UNC in the fall of 2004 as a recipient of the prestigious Morehead Scholarship. Miss Carson left an indelible mark on the university and its community during her 3 1/2  years in college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eve excelled as a student at the University of North Carolina. She was a political science and biology major and hoped to attend medical school next year. Miss Carson was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and served as a North Carolina Fellow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eve was dedicated to helping those around her. She taught science at Frank Porter Graham Elementary School in Chapel Hill and tutored kids at Githens Middle School in Durham.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She served as cochair of Nourish International, a hunger-relief group, and an assistant coach in the Girls on the Run of the Triangle, a character-building program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She studied abroad in Cuba and spent her summers helping others in Ecuador, Egypt, and Ghana. Her compassion and hard work seemed to know no bounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Eve Carson was a special woman who will be missed. Her passing leaves a void in a community who knew her as an intelligent, hard-working, compassionate leader who loved helping others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to Eve's family, friends, and all those who benefitted from her compassion and service.</paragraph>
