  <narrative>REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OUT OF TOUCH ON THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2866]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Ms. SUTTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Senator John McCain admitted months ago that he wasn't an expert on the economy. And that certainly explained his comments earlier this month when he declared, "You can make the argument that there's been great progress economically" over the last 7 years. Great economic progress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, Senator McCain has not been talking with the middle class families across America who overwhelmingly believe they are worse off today than they were when President Bush took office in January of 2001. And there is a good reason they're feeling that way. Since January of 2001, health care premiums have increased by more than $5,000 per year for the average middle class family, while college costs for their children have shot up $2,500 a year for a public university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Middle class families are finding it increasingly difficult to find the money for these skyrocketing costs, considering the average median income has actually fallen by more than $900 over the last 7 years. And Senator McCain calls this economic progress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American middle class cannot afford another 4 years of failed Republican leadership in the White House.</paragraph>
