  <narrative>Mr. CASEY:</narrative>
  <narrative><bill type="s" number="3732">S. 3732</bill>. A bill to assist in creating substantive culture change in long-term residential care by establishing a small house nursing home loan program to provide for the establishment, renovation, and construction of small house nursing homes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Promoting Small House Nursing Homes Act. This is a bill I expect will play a significant role in the way we care for our older citizens in this country. I also hope and expect this bill to make an important contribution to the framing and substance of the landmark health care reform we anticipate in the coming year. Moreover, because our current economic problems are interwoven with out-of-control health care costs, this bill will contribute  to a revitalization of our economy and the creation of new jobs. Finally, it will establish solid criteria for long term residential care that will not only improve the quality of life of older citizens, but save money through cost-effective, comprehensive and coordinated long term and health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides a dramatically different approach to long term residential care for older citizens than is offered by the traditional nursing home model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Promoting Small House Nursing Home Act incorporates the principles of person-centered care as a cornerstone of all aspects of long term residential care. What do we mean by person-centered care? The philosophy is simple: Our older citizens deserve to live lives of dignity and respect through all stages of life. About 10 years ago, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, "Life can have quality and meaning even until the very last breath." Our older citizens have a profound right to be decision-makers  in their own care--to be at the center of their own care, with a partnership of family and providers. Our older citizens are critically important to the overall health and well-being of our society. I quote a well known expert in person-centered care, Dr. Bill Thomas, who says, "People of all ages will live better lives when we succeed in bringing elders back to the heart of our society."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill translates this profound philosophy into a specific policy prescription by doing the following: creating a low-interest loan fund for building new or renovating existing long term care facilities that follow articulated small house nursing home model guidelines; etablishing clear and specific program requirements and guidelines that build upon existing programs that have successfully implemented substantial culture change and person-centered care; creating a home-like and non-institutional model of care for long term care residential facilities that is based upon the principles of: collaborative  decision-making; respect; and significantly improved quality of life for residents and staff alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We currently have an estimated 38 million Americans over the age of 65, and that number is expected to double within the next 20 years. In the midst of this, health care costs are rising exponentially, the quality of outcomes is not consistent, and older citizens are often abandoned to navigate a confusing and complex health care system. Older citizens also report extremely low levels of satisfaction with life in nursing homes. This $122 billion industry includes 16,000 nursing homes and significant  concerns persist about maltreatment and neglect of our older citizens in 20 percent of these homes. As I know from my work in State government, most nursing homes provide quality care but that 20 percent is what we hear most about. However, a recent survey by the AARP found that fewer than 1 percent of individuals over 50 with a disability want to move to a nursing home. There has to be a better way, and in fact there is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Person-centered care provides that better way. It is a straightforward concept and yet it has taken years of hard work to get concrete initiatives underway. We have a long way to go and much to learn. But in order to succeed, we must pass legislation like the bill I have introduced today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Traditional nursing facilities require residents' lives to revolve around institutional schedules for waking, bathing and dressing. Traditional facilities far too often identify residents by their health conditions, vulnerabilities and room numbers rather than their unique strengths and gifts. Staff members are attracted to the field of direct care service because they want to help older citizens but they are just as ill-served by this institutionalized culture as are the residents. Workers are  minimally trained, over-worked and carry patient loads that make it impossible to engage in any personal time with residents--in fact, such relationships are often discouraged. They have little or no say in decision-making, relegated--like the residents--to the fringes of a system that places the needs of the institution over those of the human beings in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July of this year, I chaired a hearing for the Aging Committee that examined this small house nursing home model. One of our witnesses was a nursing assistant who previously worked for a traditional nursing home and now works in a small house nursing home in Pennsylvania. She recounted the difference, saying, "Looking back on it, now, I realize that while we offered our residents excellent nursing care, that did not always translate into a high quality of life." She described handling a  wider range of duties now, yet having more time to spend with individual residents and really getting to know--and even love--them because the staffing is consistent and the turnover is almost non-existent. Another witness at our July hearing was the daughter of a woman who moved from a traditional nursing home to a small house nursing home. She summed up the dramatic change in her mother with this simple phrase, "Suddenly, life mattered again."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be a given that "life matters" to every person. While every citizen has this fundamental right, our older citizens who have worked hard their whole lives truly deserve to enjoy their later years in homes that offer them comfort, respect and autonomy. I strongly believe the Promoting Small House Nursing Homes Act will make this possible and I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this effort in its own right as well as the significant role it can play in the larger issues  of comprehensive health care reform and revitalizing our economy. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 3733. A bill to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hold at least 1 public hearing before issuance of a permit affecting public or private land use in a locality; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3733">S. 3733</bill>] Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on legislation I am introducing that will require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hold at least one public hearing before issuance of a permit affecting public or private land use in a locality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasing demand for electricity throughout the Northeast is putting a strain on energy infrastructure in my state, necessitating new transmission lines and natural gas pipelines and the expansion of existing ones. In Southwestern and Northeast Pennsylvania transmission line expansions are planned over hundreds of miles of private property, while in the Southeast natural gas pipeline expansions are underway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt these projects can be invasive, and rarely do they fail to be controversial. I make a point of touching all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties each year. In traveling Pennsylvania this fall I heard a lot of complaints from constituents who oppose these infrastructure projects, and who felt their concerns were being ignored by the energy companies and by FERC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize there will always be some opposition to large infrastructure projects. What is unacceptable, however, is for the voices of Pennsylvanians to be ignored. It may be the case that these projects are necessary to meet increased energy demand. Nonetheless, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must seriously consider and evaluate local concerns in a sensitive manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure citizens throughout the commonwealth have a voice in the development of energy infrastructure, my legislation will mandate that FERC hold an open hearing in the affected communities. State Public Utility Commissions, who have a great say in these matters, are beyond Congress' reach. But where the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is involved we can take steps to ensure that our constituents' concerns receive due consideration. Holding a hearing may not lead to all sides agreeing  on the proper route forward, but at the very least my Pennsylvania constituents will come away with the satisfaction of having publicly aired their grievances.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="Introducing S. 3735. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the eligibility of computer technology and equipment development businesses for enterprise zone incentives; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3735">S. 3735</bill>] Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on behalf of a program which I believe has been extremely helpful in helping  rural/urban communities in my state of Louisiana. I would also like to discuss a commonsense improvement to the program which I believe will allow these and other communities nationwide to be at the cutting edge of 21st century innovation and research. In particular, to help spur economic development in distressed  communities, the Congress enacted the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community, EZ and EC, Program in 1993. In 2000, the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act further expanded this initiative by authorizing 40 Renewal Communities, RCs, and 9 more EZs. Overall, the RC/EZ/EC Initiative provides these designated communities with tax incentives, grants, loans, and technical assistance to encourage investment in communities that have experienced severe economic decline. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, which oversees the RC and EZ program, RC</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, this program is of particular interest to Louisiana as we have two Urban Renewal Communities, in New Orleans and Ouachita Parish, and also have two Rural Renewal Communities, in central Louisiana and in northern Louisiana. These designations have been extremely helpful in attracting businesses to these areas of my state and in encouraging existing businesses to expand their operations. However, the designations are set to terminate in December 31, 2009. I remain committed to work  with my Senate colleagues next year to update and reauthorize such programs as this program. That is because this program helps distressed communities nationwide and is a key engine to spur public-private partnerships in rural/urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we often think of technology companies locating in areas such as Silicon Valley, California or the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Congress should not forget the role that rural small businesses and universities play in fostering innovation and development. In Louisiana, we have multiple universities participating in these cutting edge research programs and collaborating with local small businesses. Louisiana Technical University in Ruston, Louisiana, for example has grown into a leader  in scientific research at a crucial time for the region. This is because the Barksdale Air Force base located in Shreveport, which is 70 miles from Ruston, is looking to secure the permanent Cyber Command. This command would protect the United States from cyber warfare. All of the universities, colleges, and parishes in this area, including</paragraph>
    <paragraph>would benefit from this commonsense correction to the program. Many of these rural communities are located in RC areas so it is important to support this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the next Congress, as I mentioned, we will work to reauthorize the RC/EZ program. As we do this, I believe that, among other corrections, we must address one glaring problem with these programs. That is the reason why I am filing this legislation today as it makes an important correction to this program. I am pleased that my colleague, Congressman RODNEY ALEXANDER is introducing the companion bill in the House of Representatives. All three programs share the definition for a "qualified  business" used for an EZ Business, which is Section 1397C of the Internal Revenue Code. For the EC and RC programs, this was legislated by Congress by the use of a substitution of "Renewal Community" or "Enterprise Community" for "Empowerment Zone" in the relevant section of the Internal Revenue Code, which is Section 1394(b)(2)(A) for the EC program and Section 1400G for the RC program. Under this definition, generally any trade or business can be a qualified business; however, there is an exception for a business that consists primarily to develop or hold intangibles for sale or license. This clear distinction between businesses that trade "tangibles" versus those that trade in "intangibles" seems to be made as the intent was to encourage quality, high-wage manufacturing jobs in these areas. Businesses that trade in "intangibles" include companies that develop such things as patents, formulas, processes, copyrights, literary/musical works. However,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address this issue, the bill I am introducing today would clarify that companies which manufacture technology/software development are eligible for these RC/EZ incentives in taxable years after enactment of the bill, provided they meet other requirements for the RC/EZ program. In particular, Section 1397C(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to specify that businesses that trade in "intangibles" are excluded, with the exception of computer and software development companies.  I would highlight that we are not creating a new definition from scratch or making new rules for the Internal Revenue Code, instead the bill uses the definition for computer and software companies that already exists elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code. This definition,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, my staff has reviewed the Congressional Record and committee testimony since 1985 and could not find a clear Congressional intent to exclude software</paragraph>
    <paragraph> or technology development companies from the definition of a "qualified business" for this program. On the other hand, Congress specifically prohibited the following businesses: private or commercial golf courses, country clubs, massage parlors, hot tub facilities, suntan facilities, racetracks or other facilities used for gambling, and liquor stores. Despite this specificity in relation to what industries may/may not qualify, the law is silent on software/technology development companies.  As I mentioned, this industry is simply caught up in an effort to not include companies that deal strictly in intellectual property, such as copyrights or patents. I believe that this warrants correction as we should not exclude industries that are key drivers of economic development and those which are also essential to U.S. competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you another example of how the current setup of this program is really discouraging further job creation and economic development. As currently structured, the renewal community employment credit provides a 15 percent credit for the first $10,000 of wages per year paid to each renewal community employee. So a bar in a RC/EZ community would receive a tax credit for hiring another bartender but a software development company would currently not receive any incentive to hire another  engineer. Not only  does this discourage technology companies from locating in these areas but it is a disincentive for students graduating from universities or colleges in RC/EZ areas. I do not have a specific problem with including bars or restaurants in this program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to note that while I understand that this would allow businesses currently not eligible for the program to receive benefits moving forward, it is my sincere belief that this correction would follow congressional intent with the program. This is because, in my view, the bill would further improve the ability of the RC/EZ program to spur economic development in distressed areas. It would accomplish this goal by ensuring that high-wage, high technology industries are eligible  to participate in the program. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
