  <narrative>PASS ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H484]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, times are rough right now. Signs of economic turmoil are multiplying, and we seem to be headed for, or already are in, a recession. Last week stock markets around the world dropped precipitously, and only an emergency rate change by the Federal Reserve prevented them from falling even farther.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people I represent in the Hudson Valley have been particularly hard hit. Oil has passed the $100-a-barrel mark, making it more expensive than ever for people to heat their homes and drive their cars. In suburban communities in the Northeast, like the area I represent, home heating bills are up by more than 30 percent over last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expenses are rising; wages are stagnating. As a result, families struggle to pay their everyday costs. Our debts increase and investment in our future plummets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must act quickly. I am proud that this Congress will pass legislation today to stimulate the economy to help people and businesses, but especially the working families who need it most.</paragraph>
