  <narrative>PROTECTING THE AMERICAN DREAM OF OWNING A HOME -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1892]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our mortgage market is experiencing housing finance challenges and a credit crisis. Foreclosures are hitting an all time high. My own State of South Carolina is ranked 39th in the Nation for home foreclosures. Mortgage and financial challenges are placing heavy burdens on American families, and the situation has forced thousands of families to lose their prized possession, their home. One person losing their home, Mr. Speaker, is one too many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Members of Congress, can we lend money or give credit to people? No. But we can put these families and homeowners in touch with the right people, who can provide them with information on how to escape the mortgage rift.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the break, I held homeowner education seminars and invited local mortgage lenders and nonprofits to give free one-on-one counseling sessions to constituents with mortgage questions. The event had wonderfully qualified people on hand who were able to give information away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's try to protect the American Dream of owning a home. I encourage other Members to do the same.</paragraph>
