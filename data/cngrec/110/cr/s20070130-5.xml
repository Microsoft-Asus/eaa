    <paragraph>This morning, the Senate will be in a period for the transaction of morning business for 60 minutes, the first half controlled by the majority and the remaining half controlled by the Republicans. Following morning business, we will resume <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, the minimum wage bill, and debate on the motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment to <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill> will extend until 12:15 p.m. today, and that time is equally divided. However, at 11:55 a.m., the Republican leader will be recognized  for 10 minutes for whatever time he or his designee wishes to speak, and then the final 10 minutes prior to 12:15 p.m. will be controlled by the majority. The first 5 minutes of that time will be for Senator Kennedy and the second 5 minutes will be for me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regardless of the outcome of the cloture vote, the Senate will recess for the party conferences and then reconvene at 2:15 p.m. For the information of the Senate, each Senator will have until 11 a.m. to file any additional second-degree amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will have more to say later today regarding the schedule, according to how the votes turn out.</paragraph>
