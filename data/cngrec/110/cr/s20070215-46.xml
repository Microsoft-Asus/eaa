    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor CPT Eduardo Reyes, a retired pilot who flew for Philippine Airlines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 11, 1994, Captain Reyes was piloting Philippine Airlines flight 434, from Manila to Tokyo, when a bomb planted by now-convicted terrorist Ramzi Yousef was detonated on board the aircraft. The blast immediately killed 1 Japanese businessman and injured 10 others. It also caused the plane's controls to stop functioning normally, putting the lives of everybody aboard the plane at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this most trying of situations, Captain Reyes and his crew rose to the challenge. Controlling the altitude of the plane via the throttle--which I understand is an extremely difficult thing to do--Captain Reyes kept the plane in the air for nearly an hour before making an emergency landing in Okinawa. His courageous actions and outstanding skill as a pilot helped avert a great disaster and save the lives of 272 passengers and 20 crew members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Reyes later had the courage to testify on behalf of the United States against al-Qaida master bomber Ramzi Yousef. In 1994, Yousef was working on a master plan, often called the Bojinka Plot, to bomb 12 U.S. passenger jets over the Pacific Ocean in a 2-day period, killing over 4000 civilians. The bombing of Captain Reyes' plane was a test run for that plan. And, as many here remember, Yousef was also responsible for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. Captain Reyes' testimony  at Ramzi Yousef's 1996 trial helped to put one of the world's most dangerous terrorists in prison for life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his valor and clear thinking on December 11, 1994, and for his contribution to the fight against terrorism by testifying against Ramzi Yousef, I would like to commend Captain Reyes. The United States and countries throughout the world are indebted to him for these brave actions.</paragraph>
