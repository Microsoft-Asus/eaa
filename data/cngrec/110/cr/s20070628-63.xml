  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it goes without saying I am disappointed that the two issues we have had to do--so important--ethics and lobbying reform and the 9/11 Commission recommendations implementation--that there have been objections. All kinds of reasons, but it seems to me it is an effort that is not in keeping with what is good for our country. I accept what has happened, and we will be back tomorrow with our request for the lobbying reform.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would ask one thing of my colleagues. We wouldn't want this--certainly, I wouldn't, and I believe most of my colleagues wouldn't--want to let this bill be delayed because of the cuts of a thousand deaths. We have dealt with the first objection--TSA. We did something many of us thought we shouldn't do in an effort to move the bill forward. The majority leader has said he will deal with Senator Coburn's objection. But if then tomorrow something else comes  down and they make another objection and next week another objection and another objection, that would not be fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would ask my colleagues, anyone else who has objections, to bring them forward tomorrow so maybe we can try to resolve them and move this bill forward.</paragraph>
