    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one day we will end our dependence on foreign oil and empower our economy with alternative sources of energy. But until that day comes, we have to do everything in our power to strengthen our economy by making energy more affordable by increasing domestic American production. Roughly 70 percent of what we pay at the pumps comes from the price of oil in the global market, which is driven by relationships between supply and demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To lower gas prices, we have to use American energy resources. Right now, the U.S. produces 41 percent of the petroleum we use. We can do much better than that. Just by opening up a small portion of Alaska for oil production, we can recover 15 years of Saudi Arabian crude oil. By streamlining rules for energy exploration off the Outer Continental Shelf, we can access roughly 115 billion barrels of oil, enough oil to power 60 million cars for 60 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With gas prices over $4 a gallon, this Congress must act. We have to increase supply. Doing anything else would be irresponsible.</paragraph>
