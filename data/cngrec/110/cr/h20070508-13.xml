    <paragraph>Ford Motor Company has announced the closing of a casting plant in Cleveland where they're going to be outsourcing their engine casting business, and idling production at another engine plant for a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are seeing all these blue collar jobs outsourced in this country, and many white collar jobs as well. We're losing millions of manufacturing jobs. And it's not enough to just let this slide by without trying to challenge it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to have a new manufacturing policy in America where the maintenance of steel, automotive and aerospace is considered to be vital to our national economic security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to have a new not-for-profit health care system which covers all workers, so American businesses are not collapsed by the high cost of health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we have to have a new trade policy, which means the end of NAFTA and the WTO, and the beginning of trade based on workers rights, human rights and environmental quality principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our community in Cleveland is going to rally behind our auto workers. We're going to do everything we can to see if it's possible to save those plants and to make it possible to find ways of using those plants. But all across this country, we have to rise to meet this challenge.</paragraph>
