  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when President Gerald Ford played football for Michigan, he was the team's center on offense. He touched the ball on every play. The play could not begin without Gerald Ford snapping the ball. Others on the team, however, the quarterback, running back and receivers, made all the headlines, but that was fine with Gerald Ford. As the center he was neither on the right nor the left but in the middle of the charge to move the ball over the goal line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gerald Ford and Michigan were successful. Michigan won two national championships. Gerald Ford was offered contracts with NFL teams, such as the Detroit Lions. He chose law school instead, served in World War II, fought in that great war, and was a Member of this very House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he became President, ole No. 48, President Ford, took the ball again, but this time on the field of American discontent about corruption and war. He stayed in the center and once again was successful in moving Team America across the goal line of healing and hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, when entering a room, President Ford always preferred the band not play the traditional Hail to the Chief but, rather, the Michigan fight song.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, President Ford, for playing ball for Team America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
