  <chair> The clerk will report the resolution by title.</chair>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for representation of the Committee on Finance in a proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Finance Committee has obtained from that court, in connection with a hearing the committee is holding this Thursday, a writ compelling the production of a Federal prisoner, whom the committee has scheduled to appear as a witness before it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notwithstanding the long history of congressional committee seeking, and the court's approving, such writs to authorize the production of Federal prisoners to provide needed testimony before Congress, the U.S. Department of Justice has moved to quash the writ in response to objections made by the Bureau of Prisons to decisions the committee made about the organization of its hearing and presentation of its witnesses. The Justice Department's motion to quash challenges the authority of the court  to issue a writ compelling a federal prisoner to be produced to appear in a congressional as opposed to a judicial proceeding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution will authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent the Finance Committee in connection with this proceeding in order to protect the committee's interests in obtaining testimony it needs.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
