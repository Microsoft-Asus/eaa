  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A resolution (<bill type="sr" number="472">S. Res. 472</bill>) commending the employees of the Department of Homeland Security, their partners at all levels of government, and the millions of law enforcement, fire service, and emergency medical services personnel, emergency managers, and other emergency response providers nationwide for their dedicated service in protecting the people of the United States and the Nation from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies.</chair>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator LIEBERMAN in support of <bill type="sr" number="472">S. Res. 472</bill>, commending the employees of the Department of Homeland Security on the Department's fifth anniversary, and honoring their partners at all levels of Government, the private sector, and the millions of men and women in law enforcement, the fire service, emergency-medical services, and other emergency-response professions who risk their lives to protect us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years ago, on March 1, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security commenced operations as a new organizational umbrella over 22 federal agencies and with new responsibilities for developing and coordinating an integrated, all-hazards approach to planning for, mitigating against, responding to, and recovering from major disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating DHS was a critical part of our national response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We are safer today because of the work of the Department's dedicated employees and because of their support and coordination with State, local, tribal, and non-profit agencies with emergency-management, prevention, and response responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department was severely tested in the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe of 2005, and extensive investigation by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs identified serious flaws in the Department's response. But, spurred by legislation that Senator LIEBERMAN and I authored in 2006, the Department has taken significant strides in improving its response and recovery capabilities. The Department's responses to recent disasters, such as the wildfires in California, the Patriots'  Day storm in Maine, and the  recent tornadoes in the South, visibly demonstrate these improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The task of integrating the 22 agencies and more than 200,000 employees that compose the Department has not always gone smoothly. As the Government Accountability Office justly observed in a progress report on DHS last summer, however, "successful transformations of large organizations, even those faced with less strenuous reorganizations than DHS, can take 5 to 7 years to achieve." The Department has made significant progress. Congress must help it make more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this noteworthy anniversary, I salute the men and women of DHS and all of their partners who protect our borders, transportation hubs, critical infrastructure, seaports, and--above all--our people. This Senate resolution is a small but heartfelt expression of our gratitude, our respect, and our commitment to the future of this Department.</paragraph>

  <chair>Whereas it has been almost 7 years since the horrific terrorist attacks against the United States and its people on September 11, 2001;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas al-Qaeda and affiliated or inspired terrorist groups remain committed to plotting attacks against the United States, its interests, and its foreign allies, as evidenced by recent terrorist attacks in Great Britain, Algeria, and Pakistan, and disrupted plots in Germany, Denmark, Canada, and the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Nation remains vulnerable to catastrophic natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast in August 2005;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the President has declared more than 400 major disasters and emergencies under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act since 2000, in response to a host of natural disasters, including tornadoes, floods, winter storms, and wildfires that have overwhelmed the capabilities of State and local governments;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies can exact a tragic human toll, resulting in significant numbers of casualties and disrupting hundreds of thousands of lives, causing serious damage to the Nation's critical infrastructure, and inflicting billions of dollars of costs on both the public and private sectors;</chair>
  <chair>Whereas in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the continuing risk to the Nation from a full range of potential catastrophic incidents, Congress established the Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003, bringing together 22 disparate Federal entities, enhancing their capabilities with major new divisions emphasizing information analysis, infrastructure protection, and science and technology, and focusing its more than 200,000 employees on the critical mission of defending  the Nation against acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas since its creation, the employees of the Department of Homeland Security have endeavored to carry out this mission with commendable dedication, working with other Federal departments and agencies and partners at all levels of government to help secure the Nation's borders, airports, sea and inland ports, critical infrastructure, and people against acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Nation's firefighters, law enforcement officers, emergency medical services personnel, and other emergency response providers selflessly and repeatedly risk their lives to fulfill their mission to help prevent, protect against, prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas State, local, territorial, and tribal government officials, the private sector, and ordinary individuals across the country have been working in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security and other Federal departments and agencies to enhance the Nation's ability to prevent, protect against, prepare for, and respond to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other large-scale emergencies; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the people of the United States can assist in promoting the Nation's overall preparedness by remaining vigilant, reporting suspicious activity to proper authorities, and preparing themselves and their families for all emergencies, regardless of their cause: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, commends the public servants of the Department for their outstanding contributions to the Nation's security and safety;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) salutes the dedication of State, local, territorial, and tribal government officials, the private sector, and individuals across the country for their efforts to enhance the Nation's ability to prevent, protect against, prepare for, and respond to acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) expresses the Nation's appreciation for the sacrifices and commitment of law enforcement, fire service, and emergency medical services personnel, emergency managers, and other emergency response providers in preventing, protecting against, preparing for, and responding to acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other large-scale emergencies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) urges the Federal Government, States, local governments, Indian tribes, schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the people of the United States to take steps that promote individual and community preparedness for any emergency, regardless of its cause; and</chair>
  <chair> (5) encourages continued efforts by every individual in the United States to enhance the ability of the Nation to address the full range of potential catastrophic incidents at all levels of government.&lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</chair>
