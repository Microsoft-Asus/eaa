    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, is America giving visas and diplomatic immunity to terrorist sponsors who wish to destroy our country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has designated North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Syria, and Sudan as state sponsors of terrorism. These terrorist-sponsoring states are actively engaged in espionage against America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two months ago reports surfaced that Cuba is placing top intelligence operatives known as "ambassador spies" in key embassies worldwide to gather information and provide intelligence to America's enemies. In July of last year, Germany expelled an Iranian diplomatic for attempting to acquire nuclear components for the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. In December of 2006, South Korea indicted five people on charges of spying for North Korea for allegedly passing on "national secrets" such  as U.S. troop movements, among other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you another example. Three years in a row, in 2002, 2003 and 2004, personnel from the Iranian Mission to the United Nations were actually caught, they were actually caught, photographing and videotaping the New York subway and other popular landmarks in New York City. Who knows what other things they were involved in that we do not know about?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are not our friends, and yet we allow them to use the United Nations as a cover for their activities. Over 6,600 visas have been issued to diplomats, representatives, and other individuals from state sponsors of terrorism for the past 5 years. Some of these individuals with diplomatic immunity have already been expelled for spying, or in diplomatic terms, "engaging in activities inconsistent with their duties." Most of these individuals would not be otherwise allowed into our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Public Law 357, enacted in 1947, clarified the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of November 21, 1947. In section 6, this law states that "nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any way diminishing, abridging or weakening the right of the United States to safeguard its own security," and in particular, "completely to control the entrance of aliens into any territory of the United States other than the U.N. headquarters district and its immediate vicinity."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I am introducing with my colleagues today, the LIMITS Act, Limiting the Intrusive Miles of International Terrorist Sponsors Act of 2008, would limit the vicinity for state sponsors of terrorism to a half-mile radius of the U.N. complex. Half of a mile is more than enough space for personnel to obtain lodging, food and other necessities, even medical care, and it will be easier and more cost effective for the U.S. intelligence community and law enforcement to monitor suspected individuals  when necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current mileage restrictions are far too lax to be effective. Some individuals from countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism are permitted to travel within a 25-mile radius of Columbus Circle in New York City. That is 50 miles from end to end which is a horrendously large area to effectively monitor hundreds of terrorist sponsors. And yet some countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism have no mileage restrictions at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a vulnerability that we have ignored for way too long. Foreign espionage against the United States has increased in recent years. In the case of the United Nations, there is no trade-off or reciprocity. All of the risk is borne by the United States. Why are we continuing to ignore this problem?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to level the playing field by providing a consistent, strict standard for personnel from state sponsors of terrorism, while simultaneously easing the burden on the U.S. intelligence community and the law enforcement community responsible for ensuring our safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues that have not done so already to cosponsor this bill, the LIMITS Act of 2008. I encourage the leadership of the House of Representatives to bring this bill to the floor for a vote as soon as possible. Our security depends upon it.</paragraph>
