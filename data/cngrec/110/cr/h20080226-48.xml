    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this body with yet another sunset memorial. It is February 26, 2008, in the land of the free, home of the brave; and before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has now been exactly 12,818 days since the travesty called Roe v. Wade was handed down; and since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them cried and screamed as they died; but because it was amniotic fluid passing ov er the vocal cords instead of air, we could not hear them in this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of them had at least four things in common: first, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. Second, each one of them died a nameless and lonely death and each of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all of the gifts these children might have brought to humanity are now lost to us forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation  clings to blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself in our own silent genocide which mercilessly annihilates the most helpless victims to date, those yet unborn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said: "The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government." The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constituti on. It says: "No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law." Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our citizens and their</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bedrock foundation of this Republic is that clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nati on has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet, Mr. Speaker, another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps today, Mr. Speaker, maybe s omeone new who hears this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express, and that 12,818 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children is enough and that America, the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust, is still courageous enough, compassionate enough to find a better way than abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So tonight may we each remind ourselves that our ow n days in this Chamber and in this sunshine of life are numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of the innocent unborn, may that be the day when we finally find the humanity, the courage and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is February 26, 2008, Mr. Speaker, 12,818 days since Roe v. Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children, and this is in the land of the free and the home of the brave.</paragraph>
