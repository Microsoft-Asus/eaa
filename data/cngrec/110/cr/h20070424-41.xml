  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 327 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) is recognized for 1 hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings). All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Vermont?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="327">H. Res. 327</bill> provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Science and Technology. The rule waives all points of order against the bill, except those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The rule also makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for consideration  of two amendments that  were submitted for consideration. A third amendment was submitted, but was withdrawn by its sponsors. All three amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee were offered by Democratic Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> is a bipartisan bill aimed at improving K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education through recruitment, training, mentoring and professional development of teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The major provisions of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> are in response to recommendations laid out by the National Academy of Sciences in their recent report on American competitiveness. That report, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm," identified K-12 science and math education as the highest priority policy recommendations. This legislation intends to implement those important recommendations. The report concluded a comprehensive and coordinated Federal effort is urgently needed to bolster U.S. competitiveness  and preeminence in these areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This report, initiated, as you know, by Congress, makes four recommendations along with 20 implementation actions that Federal policymakers should take to create high-quality jobs and focus new science and technology efforts on meeting the Nation's needs. Those include, one, increasing America's talent pool by vastly improving K-12 mathematics and science education; two, sustaining and strengthening the Nation's commitment to long-term basic research; three, develop, recruit and retain top students,  scientists and engineers, both from the U.S. and abroad; and, four, ensure that the United States is the premier place in the world for innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to that report, in 1999, 68 percent of U.S. eighth graders received math instruction from a teacher with no, repeat, no math certification or degree. Also, according to that report, in the year 2000, 92 percent of the fifth through ninth graders, our kids, were taught physical science by a teacher with no science degree or certification. In 2004, the United States high school students ranked 24th, 24th, out of 29 countries in math proficiency, according to the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development, obviously a situation that is not tolerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes important strides towards achieving the goals laid out by the National Academy of Sciences report. <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will authorize $1.5 billion to be appropriated for new and existing programs within the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy that support the training and professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> addresses the academy's highest priority recommendations  to invest in elementary and secondary education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In summary, <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> creates programs at colleges and universities to improve the training of science, technology, engineering and math teachers; increases the size and duration of scholarships provided for those fields for people who become teachers; authorizes teacher training for advanced math and science courses; establishes a National Science Foundation grant program to support teachers institutes, including summer institutes for working math and science teachers; establishes master's degree  programs for working math and science teachers through the NSF; and creates centers for improving undergraduate education in science, technology, engineering, and math.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also authorizes scholarships for students majoring in these STEM fields who commit to teaching in our K-12 science and math programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation has very broad support among our Nation's leading education and research institutions and broad bipartisan support in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will improve teacher preparation by providing our Nation's teachers with the necessary professional development, and it should improve our students' achievement by strengthening our math and science curriculum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason for this legislation is clear: by 2010, one in four new jobs will be technically oriented, or will involve computers. Women still lag far behind in earning computer technology degrees and working in computer technology related professions, a situation we hope to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Constituents from my home State of Vermont have expressed their belief that this legislation provides the forward-thinking policy our Nation's education system requires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> will provide a particular benefit to rural regions because of the number of rural school districts that currently don't have the resources to get these jobs done. High school lab courses not only reinforce what is going on in lecture, but obviously capture the attention and engagement of our students. These are useful tools for our students to acquire, no matter what career path they choose to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An additional 10,000 math and science teachers across the United States will help ensure that our Nation can capture the imagination of our young people and give them the tools they need to succeed in the careers of science, engineering, technology, and math. The bill also supports the purchase of laboratory equipment, absolutely essential to achieving these goals, that will upgrade facilities in the development of programs that integrate laboratory experience with classroom instruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> to invest in America's competitiveness. That is essentially what this bill is about. This bill will have a great impact on our teacher preparation, will strengthen and expand the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, and attract more of our best and brightest students into these fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and granted a structured rule for consideration of the bill 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. Only two amendments were submitted to the Rules Committee and both were offered by the underlying bill's lead sponsor and the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, Mr. Gordon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am disappointed the Democrat majority rejected, on a party-line vote, an open rule for consideration of this measure, thus denying Members of the House of Representatives the opportunity to come to the floor and offer his or her amendments to this bill. And I frankly view this as another opportunity of the promises made by the new majority that were wasted with this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the underlying bill mirrors the Science and Mathematics Education for Competitiveness Act, which was approved by the House Science Committee unanimously in the last Congress. The underlying legislation aims to increase K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics or "STEM" teachers annually by 10,000. Specifically, the bill authorizes competitive awards through the National Science Foundation to institutions of higher education to improve the training of STEM teachers and  provide scholarships to students in STEM fields who commit to teaching after graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the Science and Technology Committee for working in a bipartisan manner to help address the need for America to be more globally competitive in math, science, technology and engineering fields by focusing on increasing the number of quality math and science teachers in our Nation's classrooms. Our students and educators certainly stand to benefit from this bipartisan bill which I support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just in response to comments on the rule, the Rules Committee believes that this is a judicious rule. All of the amendments that were presented to the Rules Committee were made in order. This is essentially from our point of view an open rule, subject to a filing requirement. The filing requirement obviously gives Members as well  as the Rules Committee an opportunity to review what is being proposed. The rule was adopted by a voice vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Washington.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>The gentleman stated that in his mind this is an open rule. An open rule historically in this body has been where the committee of jurisdiction marks up the bill, takes it to the committee, and then the Rules Committee, with no restrictions, allows Members that are not on that committee to come down if they wish and submit their thoughts or improvements to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are about to vote on is a structured rule. Only two amendments were offered. Actually three, and one was withdrawn. Two amendments were made in order. Those amendments were sponsored by the chairman of the committee that has primary jurisdiction on this and the sponsor of the bill, to which it has strong bipartisan support because, as I mentioned in my remarks, this mirrors a bill passed out of the Science Committee last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill very easily could have been amended in the committee by the chairman, because he is the one who wanted to have the amendments, and it could have been on the Suspension Calendar. It would have passed with strong bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with due respect to my friend from Vermont, this is not an open rule. This is a structured rule where Members are denied the opportunity if they wish to come to the floor of the House and offer amendments or improvements to this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would inquire of the gentleman, were any rules offered by Members on the Republican side that were rejected?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will simply say that a requirement of an open rule is not necessarily to have amendments submitted to the Rules Committee. The committee of jurisdiction is the one that marks it up and they take a lot of give-and-take within the committee. That is how we break this down, we break this whole cumbersome process down so committees can work in specific ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is after that process, when it goes to the floor, that Members should have an opportunity to submit whatever they wish. And there is no requirement, never has there been a requirement on something like that where they have to go to the Rules Committee and essentially ask permission to offer an amendment on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with this rule, contrary to the promises your party made going into the election, this is a closed process. Only two amendments are made in order. So Members are denied an opportunity to offer their thoughts on the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, every amendment that was offered was allowed. There was one amendment that was offered and withdrawn. That is the reason it is not being offered. There was no denial of any proposed amendment by anybody in this body, Republican or Democrat. The only requirement under the rule is that if somebody had an amendment to propose, they had to do it in a timely way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me thank our leaders on the committee. This is a very important bill. It is most especially for me, because for the last 15 years that I have been here, I have been preaching about this. So I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> for 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Science and Technology has worked to produce legislation to act upon the recommendations of the "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" report which was published by the National Academy of Sciences. This bill addresses the issues that they recommended to improve the quality and number of math and science teachers across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of particular interest to me is the Noyce teacher scholarship program. This program provides grants to universities to give scholarships to math, science and engineering students who become math and science teachers. Original law stated that for every 1 year the scholarship was awarded, new teachers must spend 2 years teaching in a high-needs school. This high-needs school requirement was softened by <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>, but I am pleased that the chairman agreed to modify the bill in conference to restore  incentives for teachers to serve in high-need schools. We are losing so many students because they are are from poor communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new design will provide more money per scholarship for students who agree to teach in underserved classrooms. This incentive will hopefully entice passionate and high-quality Noyce scholars to share their talents with students most in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the chairman's sensitivity to the great disparities that exist in availability of highly qualified math and science teachers in schools across the country. As a matter of fact, in my district we have the number one high school in the country in this area, but not without a great deal of effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subcommittee chair, where I was ranking member for about 6 years, Mr. Baird, and ranking member, Mr. Gingrey, of the Research and Science Education Subcommittee have been great advocates for lessening the achievement gap as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill> also contains a laboratory science partnership pilot program that I have worked on with Mr. Hinojosa from Texas, and he has been a strong advocate because many of these schools don't have equipment. Overall, this legislation is designed to strengthen our Nation's scientific competitiveness by producing thousands of talented and well-educated math and science teachers. That is the only way we are going to remain competitive in this country. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of <bill type="h" number="362">H.R. 362</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have had a discussion on the structure of this rule, and I just want to ask this question of my friend from Vermont, and I will be more than happy to yield to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will be debated on the floor later on this afternoon. Is it possible under this rule for any Member, Democratic or Republican Member, to come down and offer an amendment on this bill?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Vermont.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>No.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you for your honest response on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I make the point that this, therefore, is not an open rule as was presented by my friend in his remarks. This is a structured rule, and what has happened is very simply that Members not on the committee are not given the opportunity to try to improve this bill. With that, I oppose the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this bill has received bipartisan support. There has been a slight argument here about the nature of a structured rule, but I have heard from the gentleman from Washington that there is broad support for the content of this bill. It is a step that is going to move this Nation ahead in the important areas of improving science, math, technology, and engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is absolutely crucial that our country remain competitive. It is a disgrace that we are 24th out of 29 countries as measured in our performance in K-12 instruction in these critical areas to our present economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we support this bill and ask full support of the Members of the House of Representatives for its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the resolution.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.</chair>
