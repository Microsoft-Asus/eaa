    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 20 years ago Brent Bozell, armed with a handful of employees, a black and white TV and a rented computer, set up shop for what is now the acclaimed Media Research Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Believing that an overwhelming percentage of news media exhibit a distinct liberal slant, Bozell intended to document and prove the bias existed. Bozell created a news-tracking system that provides comprehensive analysis based on scientific research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From its humble beginnings, the Media Research Center has grown to be the Nation's largest news monitoring operation, employing 60 staffers with a $6 million annual budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bozell, his employees, and their compatriots will celebrate 20 years of success tonight at the company's annual gala. As a former reporter, I congratulate them for their success; and while I remain hopeful liberal bias in the media will dissipate, I am proud the Media Research Center will be on watch until it happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
