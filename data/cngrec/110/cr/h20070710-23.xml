    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Mr. Speaker, our Nation's judiciary has been the repeated targets of death threats and sometimes even violent acts. In 2005, for example, the family members of a Federal judge in Chicago were murdered. Two weeks later, a State judge, court reporter, and a sheriff's deputy were killed in an Atlanta courthouse. And so it is these acts of violence in the judiciary that bring us together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with others, we have begun on the Judiciary Committee to realize the need for legislation that will perhaps try to deal more effectively with these concerns of safety in the courts. So I am pleased that the gentleman from Virginia, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, BOBBY SCOTT; and Judge LOUIE GOHMERT of Texas, a distinguished member of the committee, have joined with me in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we seek to do is improve the security for court officers and the safeguards of judges and their families. We achieve this objective by making several revisions in the current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we make the current redaction authority of Federal judges under the Ethics and Government Act permanent. What this provision will do is prevent would-be aggrieved litigants and others who might use a Federal judge's personal information to determine how they might threaten him or her or a family member of the court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another thing we do in this legislation is authorize an additional $120 million for the United States Marshals Service over the course of the next 6 years. These monies will enable the service to increase ongoing investigations and expand protective services that are currently provided to the Federal judiciary. This is a long overdue item, and we were glad that we reached authorizing agreement on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also makes it a Federal offense to publish the personal information of a judge, law enforcement officer, or witness with the intent to cause some act of intimidation or harassment, or to commit a crime of violence. This measure authorizes $100 million over the course of the next 5 fiscal years to create and expand the witness protection programs to assist witnesses and victims of crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has taken a couple years to put these various pieces together in the bill, and we think that time for its passage is immediate, if not overdue, and I urge my colleagues to give favorable consideration to this very commonsense proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill>, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation is a bipartisan effort, as the chairman just mentioned, to improve the security of those who administer our justice system, as well as those who serve as witnesses, victims, and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, Mr. Speaker, we have seen an increase in violence and threats against judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, law enforcement officers, courthouse employees; and the list is virtually endless. It is critical that we address this violence in order to preserve the integrity of, and the public confidence in, our justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The murders of family members of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow and the brutal slayings of Judge Rowland Barton and his court personnel in Atlanta are just a few of the many examples that underscore the need to better protect those who serve our judiciary and their respective families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, almost 700 threats a year are made against Federal judges. In numerous cases, it has been necessary to assign Federal judges security details for fear of attack by terrorists, violent gangs, drug organizations, and disgruntled litigants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem of witness intimidation and threats has also continued to grow, particularly at the State and local levels, where few resources are available to protect witnesses, victims, and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill> improves coordination between the United States Marshals Service and the Federal judiciary and bolsters security measures for Federal prosecutors handling the dangerous trials against terrorists, drug organizations, and other organized crime figures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also prohibits public disclosure on the Internet and other public sources of personal information about judges, law enforcement officers, victims, and witnesses, and protects Federal judges and prosecutors from organized efforts to harass and intimidate them through false filings of liens or other encumbrances against personal property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, <bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill> provides grants to State and local courts to improve their security services. I want to thank the majority for working with us to include other important provisions that were not in the original legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under our bipartisan agreement, the legislation we consider today, Mr. Speaker, also contains increased criminal penalties for assaults against Federal law enforcement officers, makes permanent the redaction authority for judges filing ethics disclosure forms, and reauthorizes the Presidential Threat Task Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although we were unable to include in this legislation a provision that ensures retired and off-duty police officers permission to carry firearms under a Federal law enacted in 2004, I appreciate Chairman Conyers' and Subcommittee Chairman Scott's promise to move and pass on suspension the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2007, which accomplishes that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative, it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that we continue to work together on a bipartisan effort to ensure that judges, witnesses, courthouse personnel, and law enforcement officers do not have to face threats and violence when discharging their duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the State and local level there is a dire need to provide basic security services in the courtroom and for witnesses. <bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill> represents a significant first step in this area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I served as chairman of the Crimes Subcommittee in the previous Congress, the House passed legislation to improve court security, only to see it die in the other body. I commend Chairman Conyers, the distinguished gentleman from Michigan; Ranking Member Smith, distinguished gentleman from Texas; as well as Crime Subcommittee Chairman Scott, the distinguished gentleman from Virginia; and another distinguished gentleman from Virginia, Representative</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to acknowledge what Chairman Conyers did, what Ranking  Subcommittee Chairman BOBBY SCOTT did, and the effects, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, of Congressman LOUIE GOHMERT, the distinguished gentleman from Texas who himself is a former judge. These three gentlemen were tireless advocates for better judicial security, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical bipartisan measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for these closing remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with HOWARD COBLE, the gentleman from North Carolina, that our Nation's court system and those who work there must function in a safe and professional environment, and that is what we are improving in this measure. We have worked together in great harmony and cooperation, and the measure helps in a substantial way to promote better security for our judiciary and other court personnel, and I urge our colleagues to support the passage of this critical measure.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill>, the "Court Security Improvement Act of 2007." This legislation will go a long way toward enhancing the security and integrity of our judicial system and the able men and women who comprise the Federal judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me quote the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court: "Our democracy and the rule of law depend upon safe and secure courthouses." That is because an independent judiciary is essential for a regime based on the rule of law. Nothing can do more to undermine the independence of the judiciary than the very real threat of physical harm to members of the judiciary or their families to intimidate or retaliate. In 1979, U.S. District Court Judge John Wood, Jr., was fatally shot outside  of his home by assassin Charles Harrelson. The murder contract had been placed by Texas drug lord Jamiel Chagra, who was awaiting trial before the judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Daronco was murdered at his house by Charles Koster, the father of the unsuccessful plaintiff in a discrimination case. The following year, U.S. Circuit Court Judge Richard Vance was killed by a letter bomb sent to his home. The letter bomb was attributed to racist animus against Judge Vance for writing an opinion reversing a lower-court ruling to lift an 18-year desegregation order from the Duval County, Florida schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this age of the global war on terror, the danger faced by Federal judges, judicial officers, and court personnel is real, as illustrated by the three murders noted above. The recent and tragic murder of U.S. District Court Judge Joan Humphrey Letkow's husband and mother reminds us that the danger has not abated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill> provides a three-pronged legislative response to the security challenges facing our judicial institutions and personnel. First, it directs the U.S. Marshals Service to consult with the Judicial Conference regarding the security requirements for the judicial branch, in order to improve the implementation of security measures needed to protect judges, court employees, law enforcement officers, jurors and other members of the public who are regularly in Federal courthouses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also extends authority to redact information relating to family members from a Federal judge's disclosure statements required by the Ethics in Government Act and removes the sunset provision from the redaction authority, thus making the redaction authority permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill> also enhances the security and protection of judicial personnel and their families by making it a criminal offense to maliciously record a fictitious lien against a Federal judge or Federal law enforcement officer. This new crime and punishment is intended to deter individuals from attempting to intimidate and harass Federal judges and employees by filing false liens against their real and personal property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also makes it a crime to publish on the Internet restricted personal information concerning judges, law enforcement, public safety officers, jurors, witnesses, or other officers in any U.S. Court. The penalty for a violation is a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 years. Additionally, the bill increases the maximum penalty for killing or attempting to kill a witness, victim, or informant to obstruct justice or in retaliation for their testifying or providing information to law enforcement  by increasing maximum penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All in all, Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a substantial contribution to the enhancement of security of judicial institutions and personnel. I urge all members to join me in supporting this beneficial legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
