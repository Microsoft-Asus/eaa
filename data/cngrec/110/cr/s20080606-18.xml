  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the vote this morning was a vote dealing with climate change. This vote, however, was not a yes or no on climate change legislation; the vote was on a cloture motion to invoke cloture. I voted against invoking cloture. I wish to make sure those who have worked so hard on the legislation we were considering do not feel that vote diminishes the work they have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there is something happening to the climate of this planet. I believe there is something dealing with global warming that threatens our future. I believe we have a responsibility to address it. I commend those who worked on the legislation and brought it to the floor of the Senate. It was a good start. It was not perfect and needed amendments in my judgment. A tangled web was created on the floor of the Senate through no fault of the majority leader who brought this to the floor. He  indicated at the first moment that he wished this to be an open process with open debate and open opportunity for amendments. The tangled web that then ensued was a web that led us to a cloture motion and the filing of a cloture motion. Voting for cloture meant that we would be prevented from offering an amendment post cloture. I did not believe I wanted to put myself in that position because I have two amendments that have been filed. I had two</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I filed an amendment dealing with additional funding for coal and carbon capture and storage programs. I think we need to do a couple of things if we are going to have a global climate change bill work. First of all, at the front end, for the first 5, 10, 12 and 14 years, we have to have a kind of Manhattan Project in which we decide for renewable, efficiency and clean coal energy resources that we are going to break out of the box and move forward very, very, very aggressively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are going to deal with this issue, we have to move solar and be serious about developing substantial capabilities in solar energy. That requires a massive amount of research and development. We have to be serious about wind energy and geothermal and biomass as well. We have to be serious about a whole range of renewable energy resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not been serious in this country. In 1916 we said to oil and gas companies: If you want to go find oil and gas, good for you, God bless you. We want to provide big tax breaks for you for doing it. These permanent tax breaks have lasted forever regarding oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What did we do with those who were pursuing renewable energy? In 1992 we said: We will give you some tax incentives. By the way, they will be temporary and kind of shallow, and we will extend them five times for a very short term, and we will let them expire three times. That is a pathetic, anemic response for a country that ought to, in my judgment, gallop full speed ahead toward the use of renewable energy. But you have to have conservation and renewable energy research and development commitments  to achieve that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, we are going to have to continue to use coal in our future. Forty-eight percent of our electricity comes from coal. We are not in a position where we can simply say we are not going to use coal. At the front end of this bill, we need to create a substantial amount of resources to engage in the research and development, demonstration and commercial deployment of projects that allow us to use coal to produce electricity without injuring our environment. That means capturing  carbon and sequestering carbon. That is central to the future use of coal and other fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it is not as if it can't be done. We are doing it in some areas, but we need so much more work on the research and development end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a plant in North Dakota. It is the only one like it in North America. We produce synthetic natural gas from lignite coal. We take pieces of coal, and we produce synthetic gas from it. It works very well. In fact, it is one of the world's largest demonstrations for capturing and storing carbon. We capture 50 percent of the carbon from this plant; put it in a pipeline; move it to Saskatchewan, Canada; and invest it underground into Canadian oil wells to pump up and produce more oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most oil that is drilled from underground pools only provides about 30 percent of its potential. The rest remains in the ground. If you can use CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 from fossil fuels at electric power plants and other facilities, that CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 would not be released into the atmosphere to impact the climate. At the same time, you can use that CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 instead for beneficial purposes and invest into an oil well. Thus, you not only put the CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 underground and sequester it, you also enhance domestic oil development and production. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of things going on. But the underlying bill didn't have nearly enough funding at the front end, in my judgment, for the research and development component. My filed amendment would shift $20 billion in funding in the bill to say we are going to get serious. This is going to be a Manhattan-type project to find ways to continue to use our most abundant resource and do so without spoiling our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is research going on but not nearly enough. I can give you a couple of examples.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Texas company came to see me. They are taking coal for electricity. They have a couple of small demonstration projects which burn coal to produce electricity. They are treating the effluent that comes from the plant chemically, and as it comes out of the plant, they are capturing the CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 and producing byproducts, including hydrogen, chloride, and baking soda. The baking soda contains CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. In fact, this company brought me some cookies and said these come from coal. They are making the point that, by capturing the CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 from a coal plant, you can end up with baking soda used for baking cookies. It is a clever way to describe that there are innovative ways to capture CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 and protect our environment, even as we use our most abundant domestic resource. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>This photo is of single-cell pond scum, called algae. I was in Arizona recently and saw a demonstration plant that is producing algae by taking CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 off of a plant and putting it in greenhouses that produce algae. Algae is produced in water which need sunlight and CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 to grow. So it consumes CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 by producing algae, single celled pond  scum. It grows quickly, increasing its bulk in hours. They can harvest it for diesel fuel. So you actually capture the CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 and produce a beneficial use which is a biodiesel fuel. There are ways for us to do this. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is that if we are going to have a bill that works, you need to have dramatic funding commitment for research, development and demonstration up front. That was not the case with the pending bill. I know some will argue that it is. This is known as the kick-start fund for coal and is largely for demonstration and deployment. That is different from the massive need for additional research we need. We need a Manhattan Project to make these investments. That is a different kind of funding  than the research and technology we need if we are going to decide that we are going to unlock the mystery and use our most abundant resource in the future. We continue to need investments in research and development as well as demonstration and deployment programs for coal to thrive in a carbon constrained world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also a fan of wind energy, energy from the wind, for producing electricity. It makes sense. That doesn't contribute environmental problems like emitting greenhouse gases. Also, there is geothermal and biomass, the production of ethanol, and hopefully cellulosic ethanol in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was visited by Dr. Craig Venter the other day who is working to create microbes and bacteria that would essentially eat the coal or convert it into liquid fuels as it is being processed by these microbes while underground. That is pretty exciting. I also mentioned the other day that we are studying termites in the science area of our Government. These are the kinds of things people might ridicule. They say why are we spending all this money to study termites. Termites eat your house. When they  eat wood, we understand now they produce methane gas, as a lot of living things do. We are trying to figure out what in the 200 microbes in the gut of a termite might allow them to eat your house. If we can figure out how to break down woody products, it is important in terms of producing future energy from cellulosic ethanol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot to do. If we are going to be serious about climate change and global warming--and we should be, in my judgment--two things are necessary: One, we need to have kind of a Manhattan Project that in a very short period of time is going to find ways to dramatically increase the use of renewables. Second, we are going to dramatically accelerate our effort to determine how we can use coal and other fossil fuels and still protect our environment by capturing and sequestering carbon or  providing a beneficial use of carbon. That is expensive, but we can get that done. That was the amendment I had, which would shift $20 billion to the front end of this to say: Let's do this in a serious manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to indicate that my vote on cloture earlier today should not diminish the work and effort and intent of others with respect to climate change. I think something is happening in our climate. Most of us believe we will be seeing climate change legislation passing through the Congress at some point in the near future--perhaps as early as next year. When it is done, it needs to be done in a manner that is reflective of all of strengths and resources of our country to move ahead in unison  in doing the right thing in the right way.</paragraph>
