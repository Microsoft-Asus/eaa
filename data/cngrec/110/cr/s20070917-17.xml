  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today returns to the consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008. This bill contains important benefits for our men and women in uniform, including pay raises, targeted bonuses and special pays, and benefits. It also includes funding and authorities needed to provide our troops the equipment and support they will need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prompt Senate action on this bill will send an important message. Regardless of our position on the war in Iraq, we all support our men and women in uniform. The bill was approved by the Armed Services Committee on a unanimous 25-to-0 vote, and it is my hope it will receive a similarly strong endorsement from the full Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of hard work ahead of us before that can happen. As of today,  more than 300 amendments have been filed. We are working hard to clear as many of these amendments as possible, but some amendments will inevitably require votes. Where that is the case, I hope my colleagues will work with us to develop appropriate time agreements that protect the interests of everybody involved while expediting consideration of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has enacted a Defense Authorization Act every year for more than 40 years. I hope we will build on that record and show our strong support for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines by working together to pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a procedural note, I understand the President signed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 into law on Friday. In accordance with the new rules, I am placing into the Record a certification that each congressionally directed item in this bill and the accompanying report has been identified through lists identifying the names of the Senator or Senators requesting the item and that this information has been available on the committee's Web site for more than 48 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the committee is in the process of collecting a certification from each such Senator that neither the Senator nor the Senator's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and, again, that is consistent with the requirements of the Senate rules now. In accordance with the requirements of the new rules, we will make these certifications available for public inspection on our Web site as soon as practicable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my certification of compliance with the requirements of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Certification of Compliance With the Requirements of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007</narrative>
  <narrative>September 17, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>I hereby certify that--</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) each congressionally directed spending item, limited tax benefit, and limited tariff benefit, if any, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, as reported by the Committee on Armed Services, has been identified through lists, charts, or other similar means including the name of each Senator who submitted a request to the committee for each item so identified; and</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) the information described in paragraph (1) has been available on the website of the Committee on Armed Services in a searchable format for more than 48 hours.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are open to amendments. If Senators want to come to the floor now and offer amendments, it will be required we set aside a pending amendment. We are hoping to get unanimous consent to do that. We expect we will be able to get unanimous consent to do that. So Senators who have amendments, if they will come to the floor and discuss and describe their amendments, we will be able to hopefully make some progress, and then at a later time this afternoon hopefully make those  amendments in order by a unanimous consent agreement to withdraw the pending second-degree amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I realize it is not possible, because agreement has not yet been reached, to set aside the pending legislation to bring up the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act as an amendment. As the managers of the bill are not on the floor, I certainly will not take advantage of that and do it. So let me speak about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now am speaking on the National Defense Authorization Act. At an appropriate time, I will bring up amendment No. 2022. I will tell you why I will do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Congress committed an historic mistake by suspending the Great Writ of habeas corpus--not just for those confined at Guantanamo Bay but for millions of legal residents in the United States. The Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing in May on this bill illustrated the broad agreement among representatives from diverse political beliefs and backgrounds that the mistake committed in the Military Commissions Act of 2006 must be corrected. The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007, <bill type="s" number="185">S.185</bill>,  the bill on which this amendment is based, has 30 cosponsors. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported it on a bipartisan basis. I hope Senators will review the committee report on this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last year's Military Commissions Act. Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear, and it was a stain on America's reputation in the world. This is a time of testing. Future generations will look back to examine the choices we made during a time when security was too often invoked as a watchword to convince us to slacken our defense of liberty and the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Great Writ of habeas corpus is the legal process that guarantees an opportunity to go to court and challenge the abuse of power by the Government. The Military Commissions Act rolled back these protections by eliminating that right, permanently, for any noncitizen labeled an enemy combatant. In fact, a detainee does not have to be found to be an enemy combatant; it is enough for the Government to say someone is "awaiting" determination of that status--something detainees cannot even contest  when they are held in jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sweep of this habeas provision goes far beyond the few hundred detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay, and it includes an estimated 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States today. These are people who work and pay taxes, people who abide by our laws and should be entitled to fair treatment. It is, after all, the American way. It is what we brag about when we go to their countries. But under this law, any of these people can be detained, forever, without any ability to  challenge their detention in court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is wrong. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Top conservative thinkers, evangelical activists, and prominent members of the Latino community have all spoken out on the need to restore these basic American rights. GEN Colin Powell, like many leading former military and diplomatic officials, has spoken of the importance of these habeas rights. He asked, "Isn't that what our system's all about?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most powerful for me was the testimony of RADM Donald Guter, who was working in his office in the Pentagon as Judge Advocate General of the Navy on September 11, 2001, and saw firsthand the effects of terrorism. His credibility is unimpeachable when he says that denying habeas rights to detainees endangers our troops and undermines our military efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admiral Guter testified:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we limit the rights of human beings, even those of the enemy, we become more like the enemy. That makes us weaker and imperils our valiant troops, serving not just in Iraq and Afghanistan, but around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was right. Whether you are an individual soldier, or a great nation, it is difficult to defend the higher ground by taking the lower road. The world knows what our enemies stand for. The world also knows what this country has tried to stand for and live up to in--the best of times, and the worst of times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as we work to reauthorize the many programs that compose our valiant armed forces, it is the right time to heed the advice of so many of our top military lawyers who tell us that eliminating basic legal rights undermines our fighting men and women; it does not make them stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially want to thank Senator Specter and acknowledge his strong and consistent leadership on this issue. Senator Specter and I came to this  floor to offer this amendment back on July 10, when this bill was initially being considered, and thereafter. I hope all Senators will now join with us in restoring basic American values and the rule of law, while making our Nation stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is from strength that America should defend our values and our way of life. It is from the strength of our freedoms, our Constitution, and the rule of law that we shall prevail. I hope all in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, will join us in standing up for a stronger America, for the America we believe in, and support the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I send a series of amendments to the desk which have been cleared by myself and Senator Warner.

Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have any statements relating to any of these individual amendments printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <chair>Subtitle D--Nuclear Terrorism Prevention</chair>
  <chair>SEC. 3131. DEFINITIONS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In this subtitle:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The term "Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material" means the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, signed at New York and Vienna March 3, 1980.</chair>
  <chair> (2) The term "formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material" means uranium-235 (contained in uranium enriched to 20 percent or more in the U-235 isotope), uranium-233, or plutonium in any combination in a total quantity of 5,000 grams or more computed by the formula, grams = (grams contained U-235) + 2.5 (grams U-233 + grams plutonium), as set forth in the definitions of "formula quantity" and "strategic special nuclear material" in section 73.2 of title 10, Code of Federal  Regulations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The term "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty" means the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 (21 UST 483).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The term "nuclear weapon" means any device utilizing atomic energy, exclusive of the means for transporting or propelling the device (where such means is a separable and divisible part of the device), the principal purpose of which is for use as, or for the development of, a weapon, a weapon prototype, or a weapon test device.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3132. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The possibility that terrorists may acquire and use a nuclear weapon against the United States is the most horrific threat that our Nation faces.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The September 2006 "National Strategy for Combating Terrorism" issued by the White House states, "Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists is one of the gravest threats we face."&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Former Senator and cofounder of the Nuclear Threat Initiative Sam Nunn has stated, "Stockpiles of loosely guarded nuclear weapons material are scattered around the world, offering inviting targets for theft or sale. We are working on this, but I believe that the threat is outrunning our response.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Existing programs intended to secure, monitor, and reduce nuclear stockpiles, redirect nuclear scientists, and interdict nuclear smuggling have made substantial progress, but additional efforts are needed to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism as much as possible.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that a nuclear terror attack "would not only cause widespread death and destruction, but would stagger the world economy and thrust tens of millions of people into dire poverty".</chair>
  <chair> (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, and directs all countries, in accordance with their national procedures, to adopt and enforce effective laws that prohibit any non-state actor from manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, developing, transporting, transferring, or using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons  and their means of delivery, in particular for terrorist purposes, and to prohibit attempts to engage in any of the foregoing activities, participate in them as an accomplice, or assist or finance them.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei, has said that it is a "race against time" to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear weapon.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital role in coordinating efforts to protect nuclear materials and to combat nuclear smuggling.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar, Senator Pete Domenici, and former Senator Sam Nunn has resulted in groundbreaking programs to secure nuclear weapons and materials and to help ensure that such weapons and materials do not fall into the hands of terrorists.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3133. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the President should make the prevention of a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States of the highest priority;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the President should accelerate programs, requesting additional funding as appropriate, to prevent nuclear terrorism, including combating nuclear smuggling, securing and accounting for nuclear weapons, and eliminating, removing, or securing and accounting for formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material wherever such quantities may be;</chair>
  <chair> (3) the United States, together with the international community, should take a comprehensive approach to reducing the danger of nuclear terrorism, including by making additional efforts to identify and eliminate terrorist groups that aim to acquire nuclear weapons, to ensure that nuclear weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for to a degree sufficient to defeat  the threat that terrorists and criminals have shown they can pose, and to increase the ability to find and stop terrorist efforts to manufacture nuclear explosives or to transport nuclear explosives and materials anywhere in the world;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) within such a comprehensive approach, a high priority must be placed on ensuring that all nuclear weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) the International Atomic Energy Agency should be funded appropriately to fulfill its role in coordinating international efforts to protect nuclear material and to combat nuclear smuggling.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3134. MINIMUM SECURITY STANDARD FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FORMULA QUANTITIES OF STRATEGIC SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to work with the international community to take all possible steps to ensure that all nuclear weapons around the world are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for to a level sufficient to defeat the threats posed by terrorists and criminals.</chair>

  <chair>  At the end of section 1043, insert the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (f) Focus on Improving Interagency Cooperation in Post-Conflict Contingency Relief and Reconstruction Operations.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) FINDINGS.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) The interagency coordination and integration of the United States Government for the planning and execution of overseas post-conflict contingency relief and reconstruction operations requires reform.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) Recent operations, most notably in Iraq, lacked the necessary consistent and effective interagency coordination and integration in planning and execution.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) Although the unique circumstances associated with the Iraq reconstruction effort are partly responsible for this weak coordination, existing structural weaknesses within the planning and execution processes for such operations indicate that the problems encountered in the Iraq program could recur in future operations unless action is taken to reform and improve interdepartmental integration in planning and execution.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) The agencies involved in the Iraq program have attempted to adapt to the relentless demands of the reconstruction effort, but more substantive and permanent reforms are required for the United States Government to be optimally prepared for future operations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) The fresh body of evidence developed from the Iraq relief and reconstruction experience provides a good basis and timely opportunity to pursue meaningful improvements within and among the departments charged with managing the planning and execution of such operations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) The success achieved in departmental integration of overseas conflict management through the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-433; 100 Stat. 992) provides precedent for Congress to consider legislation designed to promote increased cooperation and integration among the primary Federal departments and agencies charged with managing post-conflict contingency reconstruction and relief operations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) INCLUSION IN STUDY.--The study conducted under subsection (a) shall include the following elements:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) A synthesis of past studies evaluating the successes and failures of previous interagency efforts at planning and executing post-conflict contingency relief and reconstruction operations, including relief and reconstruction operations in Iraq.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) An analysis of the division of duties, responsibilities, and functions among executive branch agencies for such operations and recommendations for administrative and regulatory changes to enhance integration.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) Recommendations for legislation that would improve interagency cooperation and integration and the efficiency of the United States Government in the planning and execution of such operations.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) Recommendations for improvements in congressional, executive, and other oversight structures and procedures that would enhance accountability within such operations.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="ADMENDMENT NO. 2268">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are engaged in one of the longest conflicts in American history, and the need for qualified nurses in military medical facilities is increasing. Tragic stories of injured veterans returning from war and heart-wrenching images on television remind us that the military needs qualified nurses. Unfortunately, the military faces the same difficulty recruiting and retaining nurses that civilian medical facilities are facing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Neither the Army nor the Air Force has met nurse recruitment goals since the 1990s. In 2004, the Navy Nurse Corps fell 32 percent below its recruitment target, while the Air Force missed its nurse recruitment target by 30 percent. At a Senate appropriations hearing earlier this year, Nurse Corps leaders pointed to a serious shortage of military nurses. The Army, Navy, and Air Force each have a 10-percent shortage of nurses, with shortages reaching nearly 40 percent in some critical specialties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Civilian hospitals face similar challenges. According to the American College of Healthcare Executives, 72 percent of hospitals experienced a nursing shortage in 2004. The shortage is growing. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, found that in 2000 this country was 110,000 nurses short of the number, both civilian and  military, necessary to adequately provide quality health care. By 2005, the shortage had doubled to 219,000. By 2020,  we will be more than 1 million nurses short of what we need for quality health care. This will create a problem for military health care as well as the Nation at large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To avoid the vast shortage HHS is projecting, we have to improve the number of nurses graduating and entering the workforce each year. If we only were to replace the nurses who are retiring, we would need to increase student enrollment at nursing schools by 40 percent. But the baseline demand for nurses, however, continues to rise, while the supply falls. If we increased the number of graduates from nursing school by 90 percent by 2020, we would still fall short of the number needed for quality  care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the major factors contributing to the nursing shortage is the shortage of teachers at schools of nursing. Last year, nursing colleges across the Nation denied admission to over 40,000 qualified applicants because there were not enough faculty members to teach the students. Last year, approximately 2,000 qualified student applicants were rejected from Illinois nursing schools because there were not enough teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the shortage does not discriminate between rural or urban areas, city or countryside, large or small schools. For example, in 2006, the University of Illinois at Chicago, consistently recognized as one of the top ten nursing programs in the United States, was sixth in total NIH research and research training dollars, and in 2004, it was ranked eighth out of 142 schools of nursing by U.S. News &amp; World Report. However, despite the nationwide prestige, the school turned away more than 500 qualified  applicants last year. Northern Illinois University, a smaller school in DeKalb, IL, was forced to reject 233 qualified applicants as a result of a shortage of teachers and financial resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Association of Colleges of Nursing surveyed more than 400 schools of nursing last year. Seventy-one percent of the schools reported vacancies on their faculty. An additional 15 percent said they were fully staffed but still needed more faculty to handle the number of students who want to be trained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statistics paint a bleak picture for the availability of nursing faculty now and into the future. The median age of a doctorally prepared nursing faculty member is 52 years old. The average age of retirement for faculty at schools of nursing is 62.5 years. It is expected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible for retirement each year from 2005 through 2012 , drastically reducing the number of available faculty--even though more than 1 million replacement nurses will be needed.  The military recruits nurses from the same source as doctors and hospitals: civilian nursing schools. Unless we address the lack of faculty, the shortage of nurses will only worsen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, the Department of Defense established a program called Troops to Teachers, which serves the dual purpose of helping relieve the shortages of math, science, and special education teachers in high-poverty schools while assisting military personnel in making successful transitions to second careers in teaching. As of January 2004, more than 6,000 former soldiers have been hired as teachers through the Troops to Teachers Program, and an additional 6,700 are now qualified teachers and looking  for placements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment will set up a pilot program called Troops to Nurse Teachers to make it easier for military nurses, retiring nurses, or those leaving the military to pursue a career teaching the future nurse workforce. I am proud to have the support of my colleagues: Senators Inouye, Inhofe, Obama, Menendez, Biden, Mikulski, Dole, Reed, Lieberman, and Collins. I thank the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman Levin, Senator Warner, for their  support and willingness to accept the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Troops to Nurse Teachers Program seeks to address the nursing shortage in the different branches of the military while tapping into the existing wealth of knowledge and expertise of military nurses to help address the nationwide shortage of nurses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goals of the Troops to Nurse Teachers program are two fold. First, the program intends to increase the number of nurse faculty members so nursing schools can expand enrollment and alleviate the ongoing shortage both in the civilian and military sectors. Second, the Troops to Nurse Teachers Program is meant to help military personnel make successful transitions to second careers in teaching, similar to Troops to Teachers. The program would achieve these goals by offering incentives to nurses  transi-&#xD0;tioning from the military to become full-time nurse faculty members, while providing the military a new recruitment tool and advertising agent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Troops to Nurse Teachers Program will provide transitional assistance for servicemembers who already hold a master's or Ph.D. in nursing or a related field and are qualified to teach. Eligible servicemembers can receive career placement assistance, transitional stipends, and educational training from accredited schools of nursing to expedite their transition. Troops to Nurse Teachers will also establish a pilot scholarship program for officers of the Armed Forces who have been involved  in nursing during their military service to help them obtain the education needed to become nurse educators. Tuition, stipends, and financing for other educational expenses would be provided. Recipients of scholarships must commit to teaching at an accredited school of nursing for 3 years in exchange for the educational support they receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Troops to Nurse Teachers Program will provide active military nurses the opportunity to complete a 2-year tour of duty at a civilian nursing school to train the next generation of nurses. In exchange, the nurse officer will commit to additional time in the military or the College of Nursing will provide scholarships for nursing students that commit to enlisting in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the support of over 20 nursing organizations, including the following: American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American Organization of Nurse Executives, American Nurses Association, Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses, American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing, American College of Nurse Practitioners, American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, American Health Care Association, American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses, Association of Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses,  American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, Inc., American Radiological Nurses Association, Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses, Emergency Nurses Association, National Black Nurses Association, National Council of State Boards of Nursing, National Gerontological Nursing Association, National League for Nursing, National Nursing Centers Consortium, National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties, Oncology Nursing Society, Society of Urologic Nurses &amp; Associates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, both Personnel and Recruitment and Health Affairs, are in support of the amendment. We have also worked hard to secure the support and incorporate important feedback from the Nurse Corps of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must increase the number of teachers preparing tomorrow's nursing workforce. With the aging of the baby boom generation and the long-term needs of our growing number of wounded veterans, the military and civilian health care systems will need qualified nurses more than ever. The Troops to Nurse Teachers Program will help to alleviate the shortage of nurse faculty and ultimately help make more nurses available for both civilian and military medical facilities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the chairman and Senator Warner. Let me read a portion of a letter from the Department of Justice first, and I will include it for the Record at the conclusion of its reading. This letter is addressed to Chairman Pat Leahy of the Judiciary Committee. It begins by saying--it is dated June 6 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This letter presents the views of the Department of Justice on <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill>, the "Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007," as introduced in the U.S. Senate. If enacted, <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill> would remove the habeas corpus restrictions included in the "Military Commissions Act of 2006."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a full and open debate, a bipartisan majority of Congress passed the MCA just last fall. The MCA's restrictions on habeas corpus codified important and constitutional limits on captured enemies' access to our courts. The DC Circuit upheld MCA's habeas restrictions in--the name of the case is Boumediene v. Bush--I will omit the citation--decided in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision of <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill> that seeks to remove these important limits ignores their history and their role in protecting our Nation's security. As the Supreme Court recognized in Johnson v. Eisentrager, a 1950 case, the extension of habeas corpus to alien combatants captured abroad "would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy," and the Constitution requires no such thing. The United States already provides alien enemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with an  unprecedented degree of process, which includes judicial review of decisions regarding their detention before the Federal appeals court in Washington, DC. Repealing the MCA's limitations on habeas would simply burden our courts with duplicative and unnecessary litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is more of the letter, but I will submit it for the Record at this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that the amendment offered by Senator Leahy is virtually the same, if not the same, as the bill introduced. I am presuming that the President's senior advisers would, as a result, also recommend a veto of the bill if it included this provision.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>June 6, 2007.  </narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This letter presents the views of the Department of Justice on <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill>, the "Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007," as introduced in the United States Senate. If enacted, <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill> would remove the habeas corpus restrictions included in the "Military Commissions Act of 2006" ("MCA").</narrative>
  <narrative>After a full and open debate, a bipartisan majority of Congress passed the MCA just last fall. The MCA's restrictions on habeas corpus codified important and constitutional limits on captured enemies' access to our courts. The D.C. Circuit upheld the MCA's habeas restrictions in Boumediene v. Bush, 476 F.3d 981 (D.C. Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1478 (2007). The provision of <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill> that seeks to remove these important limits ignores their history and their role in protecting our Nation's  security. As the Supreme Court recognized in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950), the extension of habeas corpus to alien combatants captured abroad "would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy," id. at 779, and the Constitution requires no such thing, see id. at 780-81. The United States already provides alien enemy combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with an unprecedented degree of process, which includes judicial review</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your consideration of our views. If we may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that there is no objection to this letter from the perspective of the Administration's program and that enactment of <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill> would not be in accord with the President's program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Now, the Defense authorization bill is extraordinarily important to our troops. To add a totally extraneous provision amending a different bill to the Defense authorization bill, especially one which carries the suggestion of a Presidential veto, would be the height of irresponsibility on the part of the Senate. The substantive arguments of the Department of Justice with respect to habeas are correct, and the Senate should not, therefore, seek to amend another statute in the Defense  authorization bill, thus inviting a veto of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Related to the habeas corpus provision is the amendment that is now pending offered by Senator Graham of  South Carolina. That amendment would strike a provision of the Defense authorization bill--section 1023--that also relates to the subject of treatment of detainees. Unfortunately, the way the committee bill was written, the bill that is before us right now, if we retain that language and we don't strike it, as the Graham amendment would  do, we would essentially be returning to a law enforcement approach to terrorists that, frankly, failed us before 9/11 and obviously does not work in the post-9/11 context. We can't deal with all of the enemy combatants as criminal defendants. These people who are picked up on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan cannot be dealt with in the same way as criminal defendants in our court system. Senator Graham's amendment would strike these harmful provisions of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to begin by reminding my colleagues of the evil nature of these terrorists and then go through the three particular parts of this provision that require removal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, a requirement that al-Qaida terrorists held in Iraq and Afghanistan be given lawyers--I mean, just imagine that; second, the authorization to demand discovery and compel testimony from servicemembers; and third, the requirement that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees be provided access to classified evidence. To state these three provisions of the bill is to recognize immediately why it is so harmful that they be included in this bill and why they need to be stricken, but focus for just  a moment on the people we are talking about held at Guantanamo Bay and picked up in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At least 30 of the detainees released already from Guantanamo Bay have since returned to waging war against the United States and our allies. Of course, the provisions of section 21 are all designed to effectuate the release of some of these prisoners--some of these detainees. So 30 have already been released because we no longer deemed them to be a threat to the United States or our forces, but after their release, 12 of the released detainees have been killed in battle by U.S. forces or--well,  by U.S. forces; others have been captured. In other words, we released them, they went right back to the battlefield, 12 of them have been killed in battle, others have been recaptured, 2 released detainees became regional commanders for Taliban forces, and 1 attacked U.S. and allies' soldiers in Afghanistan, killing 3 Afghan soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One released detainee killed an Afghan judge. One released detainee led a terrorist attack on a hotel in Pakistan and a kidnapping raid that resulted in the death of a Chinese civilian, and this former detainee recently told Pakistani journalists that he planned to "fight America and its allies until the very end."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even under the procedures today, which give due process to these detainees and allow them to be released if we can no longer demonstrate they are a threat to U.S. forces--even under these provisions, at least 30 of the detainees have gone right back to the battlefield and are attacking us and our forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions of section 1023 would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to detain committed terrorists such as this, people who have been captured while waging war against us. No nation in the history of armed conflict has imposed the kinds of limits this bill would impose on its ability to detain enemy war prisoners. War prisoners released in the middle of an ongoing conflict, such as members of al-Qaida, will return to waging war. That is the whole point of prisoners  of war. In the war you capture people and hold them so they cannot return to the battlefield to kill your troops. We have already seen this happen 30 times with the detainees released from Guantanamo, as I said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If section 1023 were to be enacted, we could expect more civilians and Afghans and Iraqis will be killed, and it may be inevitable that even our own soldiers will be killed by such released terrorists. This is a price our Nation should not be forced to bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned three specific general problems with section 1023. The first has to do with a requirement of the bill that al-Qaida terrorists who are held in Iraq and Afghanistan must be provided with lawyers. I cannot imagine that the details of this were known to the members of the committee when they put it into the bill. This could never be executed. It would require the release of the detainees; either they get lawyers or they have to be released. And here is why. The Defense bill requires  that counsel be provided and trials be conducted for all unlawful enemy combatants held by the United States, including, for example, al-Qaida members captured and detained in Iraq and Afghanistan, if they are held for 2 years. We hold approximately 800 prisoners in Afghanistan</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This scheme is totally unrealistic. The entire Army JAG Corps only consists of about 1,500 officers, and each is busy with their current duties. Moreover, under the bill, each detainee would be permitted to retain private or volunteer counsel. Our agreements with the Iraqi Government bar the United States from transferring Iraqi detainees out of Iraq. As a result, the bill would require the United States to train, transport, house, and protect potentially thousands, or tens of thousands, of private  lawyers in the middle of a war zone during ongoing hostilities. That is impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about this in the context of other conflicts, not just in Iraq or Afghanistan. In the context of World War II, anybody hearing this would think it is nuts. But the bill before us literally requires us to provide attorneys to these captured detainees in Iraq--tens of thousands of them. This proposal would likely force the United States to release thousands of these enemy combatants in Iraq, as I said, because there is no way you could provide all of the lawyers to them. Obviously, that would  further jeopardize our military. By requiring a trial for each detainee, this provision would also require U.S. soldiers to offer statements to criminal investigators, needing later to prove their case after they captured someone. In other words, unlike today, when you are on the battlefield and you capture somebody and you hold them because they are a threat, but you are not putting them on trial, now you are going to put them on trial and you have to have the kind of evidence that would stand up in court. You have watched the TV shows with the clever defense lawyers. You know about, "I object, Your Honor; that is not relevant," or "that is hearsay." On the battlefield, who walks around with lawyers making sure Miranda rights are read and evidence is collected and statements are taken that will hold up</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A horrible precedent would be set for the future. Aside from the war in Iraq, this provision would make fighting a major war in the future simply impossible. In World War II, we detained over 2 million enemy prisoners of war. It would have been impossible for the United States to have conducted a trial and provided counsel to 2 million captured enemy combatants. The bottom line, with respect to this provision, section 1023, the requirement of counsel for these detainees held in Iraq and Afghanistan,  is that it would be impossible to implement. It is patently absurd and, as a result, it should be stricken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second point is authorizing al-Qaida detainees to demand discovery and compel testimony from American soldiers. I alluded to that a second ago. The underlying bill would actually authorize unlawful enemy combatants, including al-Qaida detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan, to demand discovery  and compel testimony from witnesses, just as we do in our criminal courts in the United States. These witnesses would all be the U.S. soldiers who captured the prisoner. Under the bill, an American soldier  could literally be recalled from his unit at the whim of an al-Qaida terrorist in order to be cross-examined by him, or his lawyer, or a judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Newspaper columnist Stuart Taylor describes the questions such a right would raise:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Should a Marine sergeant be pulled out of combat in Afghanistan to testify at a detention hearing about when, where, how, and why he had captured the detainee? What if the northern alliance or some other ally made the capture? Should the military be ordered to deliver high-level al-Qaida prisoners to be cross-examined by other detainees and their lawyers?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on and on. The questions abound. As the Supreme Court itself observed in Johnson v. Eisenstrager, which is the law on this subject:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his own civil court and divert his efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the U.S. Supreme Court talking not long after World War II, when a question similar to this arose, and a Justice of the Supreme Court says it "would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to call him into account in his own civil court and divert his efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be difficult to conceive of a process that would be more insulting to our soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, many al-Qaida members captured in Afghanistan were captured by special operators whose identities are kept secret for obvious reasons. This would force them to reveal themselves to al-Qaida members and expose themselves, or simply forgo the prosecution of the individual, which is obviously more likely to happen. You simply could not do all of this, so you would have to forgo the prosecution and release the prisoner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, Americans should not be subject to subpoena by al-Qaida. Think about that. That brings me to the last point--the requirement that al-Qaida and Taliban detainees be provided with access to classified evidence. You would have to give the enemy your classified evidence, the sources and methods of your intelligence operations, in order to prosecute them, which is what would be required by the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the exact language. The bill requires that detainees be provided with "a sufficiently specific substitute of classified evidence" and that detainees' private lawyers be given access to all relevant classified evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this bill was brought up in the Senate, some Members questioned whether this bill requires us to share classified information with al-Qaida detainees and their lawyers. I will direct this to specific pages and lines of the bill to show what it does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On page 305, lines 16 through 21, the bill expressly provides that "the detainee" must be provided--I am quoting now--access to a "sufficiently specific" summary of "the classified evidence that is submitted against the detainee." This language appears to mirror the Classified Information Procedures Act rules that apply to the use of classified information in Federal courts. Like CIPA, these procedures give a detainee a right to the substance of classified evidence. The Government might  be able to redact some names or other information, but only if it still gives the detainee the substance of the evidence. And if the United States is not willing to compromise the evidence in this way, it cannot use the evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, at page 305, line 5, the bill expressly requires that under its provisions, "counsel for the detainee is provided access to the relevant classified evidence." I don't know how you can be any more specific than that. His lawyer gets to see relevant classified evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Foreign and domestic intelligence agencies are already very hesitant to divulge classified evidence to the CSRT hearings we already conduct. These are part of the internal and nonadversarial military process today. Intelligence agencies will inevitably refuse to provide sensitive evidence to detainees and their lawyers. They will not risk compromising such information for the sake of detaining one individual terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the United States already has tenuous relations with some of the foreign governments, particularly in the Middle East, that have been our best sources of information about groups such as al-Qaida. If we give detainees a legal right to access such information, these foreign governments would simply, I presume, shut off all further supply of information to the United States. Why would they do otherwise? They don't want to expose their own sources, compromise their evidence, or expose  even the fact that they have cooperated with the United States. By exposing our cooperation with these governments, the bill perversely applies a sort of "stop snitching" policy toward our Middle Eastern allies, which is likely to be as ruthlessly effective as when applied to criminal street gangs to potential witnesses to a crime in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of our best information is gained from foreign intelligence services who, like us, are trying to find out everything they can about these terrorists. Once they know we have to turn the information they gave us over to the terrorists, they are going to stop cooperating with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument I presented--that sharing classified evidence with al-Qaida detainees and their lawyers would badly damage America's efforts in the war with al-Qaida--was recently reinforced by several declarations that were recently introduced in the ongoing Bismullah litigation. These declarations were filed by the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the CIA, and by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, our three top intelligence agencies. Together, these statements  confirm that sharing classified information with detainees and their lawyers would not only inevitably lead to leaks of sensitive information, but that it would violate American intelligence agencies' agreements with foreign governments and with confidential human sources--violations that would inevitably undermine these organizations and individuals' willingness to cooperate with the United States in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final point is that we already know, from hard experience, that providing classified and other sensitive information to al-Qaida members is a bad idea. During the 1995 Federal prosecution in New York of the "blind sheikh," Omar Rahman, prosecutors turned over the names of 200 unindicted coconspirators to the defense. They were required to do so under the civilian criminal justice system of discovery rules, which require that large amounts of evidence be turned over to the defense. The judge  warned the defense that the information could only be used to prepare for trial and not for other purposes. Nevertheless, within 10 days of being turned over to the defense, the information found its way to Sudan and into the hands of Osama bin Laden. As the district judge who presided over the case said, "That list was in downtown Khartoum within 10 days, and bin Laden was aware within 10 days that the Government was on his trail."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what happens when you provide classified information in this context.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In another case tried in the civilian criminal justice system, testimony about the use of cell phones tipped off terrorists as to how the Government was monitoring their networks. According to the judge, "There was a piece of innocuous testimony about the delivery of a battery for a cell phone." This testimony alerted terrorists to the Government surveillance and, as a result, their communication network shut down within days and intelligence was lost to the Government forever--intelligence that might have prevented who knows what.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular section of the bill, 1023, repeats the mistakes of the past. Treating the war with al-Qaida similar to a criminal justice investigation would force the United States to choose between compromising information that could be used to prevent further terrorist attacks on one hand and on the other letting captured terrorists go free. As I said before, this is not a choice our Nation should be required to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read a couple of the quotations I alluded to earlier from the  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, GEN Michael Hayden, relative to the damage that would be caused by requiring this classified information to be turned over to the defendant or his lawyers:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... [M]uch of the information that is potentially discoverable was provided to the CIA by foreign intelligence services or discloses the specific assistance provided by the CIA's global partners in the global war on terror. If the CIA is compelled to comply with the Court's decision, the CIA will be obligated to inform its foreign liaison partners that a court order requires that the CIA provide this information to the Court and detainee counsel. There is a high probability that certainly liaison  services will decrease their cooperation with the CIA because of the extent that their information has become enmeshed in U.S. legal proceedings. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[S]ome information discoverable under the Court's decision originated with, or pertains to, clandestine human intelligence sources. These individuals provide information or assistance to the CIA only upon the condition of absolute and lasting secrecy. Revealing this information--even to the Court or to cleared counsel--would expressly violate these agreements, and would irreparably harm the CIA's ability to utilize current sources and to recruit sources in the future. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read one other comment from General Hayden, the Director of the CIA:</paragraph>
    <paragraph> ..... With over 300 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, it appears that compliance with the Court's decision will require disclosure to several hundred--perhaps more than one thousand--private attorneys who are not employees of the U.S. Government and who are not trained in handling classified information. With so many untrained individuals allowed access to such sensitive information, I believe that unauthorized disclosures, even if inadvertent, are not only probable, but inevitable. The regulations  controlling access to classified information recognize that limiting the number of people with access is a necessary step in safeguarding sensitive information. The Court's decision would eviscerate the U.S. Government's carefully conceived plan to keep its most highly sensitive information compartmentalized and would increase the likelihood of public disclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quote a comment from Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in his affidavit to the court in the case I mentioned:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Disseminating human source information could reasonably lead to the disclosure of their identities because often the information provided by human sources is singular in nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, he is the only person who knows about it, so when the information is divulged, then the other side knows exactly where it came from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back to Director Mueller:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The disclosure of singular information could endanger the life of the source or his/her family or friends, or cause the source to suffer physical or economic harm or ostracism within the community. These consequences, and the inability of the FBI to protect the identities of its human sources, would make it exceptionally more difficult for the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies to recruit human sources in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the kinds of irreparable harm that would result if the language of section 1023 remains in the bill. Not my words, but Director Mueller of the FBI, General Hayden, the Director of the CIA, and now I quote from the Director of National Intelligence, Michael McConnell. Admiral McConnell had this to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph> ..... [T]he Intelligence Community has many sources of information that must be protected. For example, much of the information at issue was provided by foreign intelligence services or would reveal the specific assistance provided by foreign partners in the global war on terror. Certain liaison services will likely decrease their cooperation with the U.S. Government if their information is caught up in U.S. court proceedings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> ..... Human sources also provide the Intelligence Community with critical information, but only upon the condition of absolute secrecy. Revealing this information would violate the sources of confidentiality we provide these sources and would likely result in their minimizing or ceasing altogether their cooperation. Such a disclosure would harm the Intelligence Community's ability to retain current sources and recruit new ones, and if we cannot recruit and retain sources, the Intelligence Community  simply cannot conduct its business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the point of Senator Graham's amendment to strike these provisions from the bill. They would irreparably harm our intelligence collection capability, which is the first defense against these terrorists. That is why the Graham amendment striking section 1023 should be adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have already bent over backward to provide the detainees at Guantanamo the ability to contest their detention and to have their detention reviewed and eventually even have it reviewed in the U.S. Supreme Court, and before that the Circuit Court of Appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very fair system, more fair than has ever been provided by any other nation in any other circumstance and more than our Constitution requires. So we are treating the people we capture in a very fair way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we cannot do is to take those same kinds of protections and apply them anywhere we capture someone in the foreign theater. And as I said before, never in the history of warfare have they been subjected to the criminal justice system of our country. To take that system and try to transport it to the fields of Afghanistan and Iraq would obviously not only be breaking precedent but is a horrible idea for all the reasons I indicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to give careful attention to the dangerous return to the pre-9/11 notion that these terrorists are, after all, only common criminals and we have to treat them that way. They have made no secret that they are actually at war with us, and we ignore this point at our peril.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind my colleagues that the Statement of Administration Policy on this bill says the President will be advised to veto the bill if section 1023 remains in the bill and refer again to a similar statement from the Department of Justice with respect to the habeas corpus provisions that would be added to the bill in the amendment of Senator Leahy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will take all of this information into account when they consider voting on these amendments in this very important Defense authorization bill which we need to pass and the President will want to sign so we can do what is necessary to support our troops whom we have sent into harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Graham amendment to strike section 1023 and not to support the additional habeas corpus rights to terrorists who attack our troops.</paragraph>

  <chair> The distinguished Senator from Connecticut.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, first, I want to commend Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their leadership on this legislation. It is not news that they do a good job. They do it consistently year in and year out. This may be one of the last Defense authorization bills in which Senator Warner is involved, having made his announcement about his decision to retire from the Senate. He has another year, next year, on the Defense authorization bill. I already sense the notion  of missing him here. While he is not in the Chamber this evening, I commend Senator Warner and Senator Levin for the fine work they do year in and year out on this very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment to restore the writ of habeas corpus for individuals held in U.S. custody. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this amendment and a cosponsor of the underlying bill from which it draws its strength, <bill type="s" number="185">S. 185</bill>, the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act, also introduced by Senators Specter and Leahy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 700 years, the legal system has recognized the importance of habeas corpus, the right of an individual to question the legality of his or her detention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Military Commissions Act is perhaps the most disappointing and dangerous piece of legislation passed in the more than quarter-century I have been a Member of this body. Among its many troublesome provisions, the act eliminated habeas corpus for those individuals held by our Government as enemy combatants. By stripping these individuals of the right to petition the Government, we have undermined our Nation's longstanding commitment to the rule of law and human rights. Advocates of this provision  argued that stripping away this fundamental right was necessary to protect our Nation's security. That is totally false, in my view. We can both effectively prosecute terrorists and remain true to our values. In fact, if we do otherwise, I strongly suggest that we jeopardize our security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand on the floor of the Senate seeking to undo what Congress did last year when it summarily stripped habeas corpus rights with the enactment of the Military Commissions Act. Were our Founding Fathers alive today, I believe they would be seriously dismayed to realize how far our country has strayed from the values enshrined in our Constitution with the adoption of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stripping of habeas corpus rights is just one of a number of egregious provisions included in the Military Commissions Act. That is why earlier this year I introduced <bill type="s" number="576">S. 576</bill>, the Restoring the Constitution Act, to address these errors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to restoring habeas corpus rights, <bill type="s" number="576">S. 576</bill> would also require the United States to live up to its Geneva Convention obligations, provide detainees access to attorneys for trials, make inadmissible trial evidence gained through torture or coercion, empower military judges to exclude hearsay evidence they deem to be unreliable, and provide for the expedited judicial review of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to determine the constitutionality of all of its provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Restoring the Constitution Act would undo the most damaging and unconstitutional aspects of the Military Commissions Act while providing the U.S. military a greater ability to bring our enemies to justice through military commissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take a back seat to no one when it comes to defending our Nation's security. Let me be clear, I believe military commissions in very limited circumstances may be very effective in bringing combatants to justice. However, I see no reason why procedures based on the well-established, Uniform Military Code of Justice should be abandoned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is a right way and a wrong way to win the fight we are in. Procedures that adhere to immediate bedrock legal principles, such as habeas corpus, abide by the Geneva Conventions, and exclude hearsay evidence or evidence obtained through torture, to name but a few, do not make us weaker. Quite the contrary. They demonstrate that no terrorist can destroy our way of life and our fundamental values that have guided our Nation for over two centuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the debate on the Military Commissions Act last year, Senator Specter, Senator Leahy, and I offered an amendment that would have retained the writ of habeas corpus. Unfortunately, our amendment was rejected by this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 28, 2006, I voted against the Military Commissions Act. Sadly, I was in the minority in doing so. I was and remain deeply disappointed that the Senate passed this misguided legislation. That day was a dark day in the history of this body. On that day, we abandoned our commitment not only to human rights, but also to the rule of law, commitments that separate us from our enemies, commitments that have been fundamental to American leadership since the end of World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue has special resonance with me because of my father, Thomas Dodd, who sat in this very body at this very desk, as a member of the Senate from Connecticut. Years before, in 1945 and 1946, before becoming a Member of Congress, my father was a prosecutor working alongside Justice Robert Jackson at the Nuremberg war crimes trials in Germany. There the United States demonstrated to the world its profound commitment to the rule of law, due process, and human rights. Many of our allies did  not see the need for trials for Nazis held by allied forces. Indeed, many of them called for summary executions. The Soviet Union wanted a show trial and then to shoot the defendants at Nuremberg. Winston Churchill, the former British Prime Minister, also advocated summary execution for the defendants at Nuremberg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States, Judge Robert Jackson, Henry Stimson, the Republican Secretary of War under Franklin Roosevelt, Ben Rosen, Robert Jackson and my father argued, that, no, we were different. The United States was going to demonstrate to the world that civility and the rule of law was what was at stake in the war with Germany and Japan and that we would not succumb to the same kind of treatment they gave to their victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opening statement made by Robert Jackson at Nuremberg, a statement which I put to memory a long time ago, indicates the difference we brought to this issue. Robert Jackson, speaking of the Soviet Union, the British, the French, and the United States, said on that occasion:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the rule of law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, we gave the Nazis--members of the world's most barbaric regime--the protections and the rights of the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nuremberg trials not only brought many of the Nazi war criminals to justice--most were executed--but helped to demonstrate to the world the importance of providing even the most heinous of criminals the protections of the rule of law. Doing so makes our Nation incalculably stronger, not weaker at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I fear Congress has allowed the President to diminish our Nation's commitment to human rights and the rule of law. We have failed to stand up for our most cherished values. We let fear--the fear of being seen as weak--override our duty to protect the Constitution and the values of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not too late to right the wrong of last year. We will have that opportunity in the next day or so. While I am hopeful the Federal courts will strike down many of the provisions of the Military Commissions Act, I believe a decision earlier this year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia demonstrates the need for the amendment before us today by Senators LEAHY, SPECTER, myself, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 20, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the provisions of the Military Commissions Act eliminating the writ of habeas corpus for enemy combatants. Despite two recent Supreme Court decisions suggesting that habeas rights cannot legislatively be stripped away, the split decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia underlines the need for this body to proactively act now to unambiguously restore habeas rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 60 years, the United States has helped to lead the world through its commitment to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. Last year, our Nation lost the moral high ground. This year, Congress must reassert to the Nation, the President, and the courts that we recognize the vital role of habeas corpus in our legal system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment is the first step in undoing the terrible damage the Military Commissions Act has done to our legal system and our international reputation. I implore my colleagues to begin today to undo the harm done to our Nation's reputation by voting to restore habeas rights, which have always been a core element of our jurisprudence, and once again restore the moral authority we captured more than 60 years ago at a place called Nuremberg. This generation bears  no less a responsibility to protect those basic rights that are the foundation of our great Nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I, too, wanted to echo the comments of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. I am sure Senator Warner will be recognized many times between now and the time he finally takes his last vote in this Chamber, and as he pointed out, he has a long way to go before that time comes over the course of the next several months. But so many of us respect what he has done over the years as ranking member and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and his work will,  in fact, be greatly recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to make one quick point in response to what the Senator from Connecticut pointed out, recalling his very famous father, somebody who served in this body and served our Nation well in other capacities, including at Nuremberg, and his friend, Justice Jackson, the same Justice Jackson whom I quoted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator wasn't on the floor, but I quoted Justice Jackson in the Eisentrager case to point out that nothing could fetter our commanders more than to require habeas corpus rights for the German prisoners of war or the prisoners who were at issue in the Johnson v. Eisentrager case. Justice Jackson himself recognized that the procedures that were awarded to the 50-some war criminals at Nuremberg were not the same kinds of procedures that were being sought in the Eisentrager case. And the habeas  corpus rights that would be granted under the Leahy amendment are far different from the rights that were granted to the Nuremberg war crimes defendants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one question that would be interesting to ask of the proponents of the legislation is, if we simply took the rights that were granted to the war criminals tried at Nuremberg and gave those rights to the detainees at issue here, would that be a satisfactory result? I suspect the answer would be no because they are nowhere near the rights that would be included in the amendment that is pending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to cite Justice Jackson is to refer back to what he said in Eisentrager and recognize that nothing, according to him--and I agree--would more fetter our commanders and our troops than granting habeas rights to prisoners or enemy detainees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I might make one further point. I am trying to recall how many defendants there were at Nuremberg. My recollection of the number tried for war crimes is that there were approximately 50. I may be off by a few on that number, but I think my point would still remain, which is that it is one thing to try 50 war criminals out of over 2 million POWs, and it is quite another to grant all 2 million the rights of war criminals. We have tried some of the detainees as the equivalent of  war criminals in our courts--Padilla is one of them--but that is not to say we should hold the same criminal trials for all of the tens of thousands of detainees being held in Iraq or Afghanistan.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>I had the distinct pleasure of visiting Carrollton, AL, in Pickens County, where they have a museum to maintain the history of a large German prisoner of war camp in the United States. The Senator mentioned that certain legal rights were accorded 50 or so prisoners. But those were prisoners tried in Nuremberg after the war--after the war--for war crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, is the Senator aware of any instance in either the German camps or other prisoners who may have been held in the United States during wartime being provided habeas rights?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, that is a great question, and the answer is that there have never been, in the history of the world, habeas rights granted to enemy detainees or prisoners of war in order to challenge the fact of their detention by either the United States or by the other country from which the great writ came--England. They have never been granted. So the answer is there is no precedent whatsoever. That is why, when colleagues say we want to restore habeas rights, that is an incorrect  characterization. Enemy combatants and POWs have never had habeas rights to challenge their detention as a matter of being provided by our Constitution. Never has our Constitution been interpreted as requiring those rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Alabama.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to thank Senator Kyl for his hard work on these important issues. He is a superb lawyer who is a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, and he has been a member of the Intelligence Committee. He understands these issues and, thanklessly, he devotes hours of his time to try to research and study Supreme Court cases to try to make sure we do the right thing here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important thing for us to remember is this, and Senator Kyl just said it, that the refrain we are hearing about restoring habeas rights to prisoners of war, even unlawful combatant detainees, is not so. We have not done that, and it is a matter that is quite clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The origin of the great writ--the writ of habeas corpus--can be traced back to the Magna Carta in the 13th century. It is truly a great writ. It is truly a powerful tool for any person who is being detained to demand that someone, somewhere come forward and tell the world why they are being detained. That is what totalitarian and Communist governments do all the time. These kinds of dictators and Communists and Nazis go out and grab people and put them in jail and never charge them, never announce  where they are, even. So that is not what we want to do here. However, never in the history of the writ's existence has an English or American court granted habeas to enemy combatants held during a time of war. As early as 1793, the American courts--1793--recognized</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that year, in 1793, a district court in Pennsylvania said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Courts will not grant a habeas corpus in the case of a prisoner of war because such a decision on this question is in another place being a part of the rights of sovereignty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, national power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court of the United States reaffirmed that position in 1950 in a case called Johnson v. Eisentrager. In that case, the Supreme Court made expressly clear that U.S. constitutional protections do not apply to aliens who are detained outside the borders. It was the first case to deal with a habeas petition of enemy combatants detained outside the borders of the United States since the statute was originally enacted as part or the Judiciary Act of 1789. It is now codified as 28 U.S.C.  Section 2241.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that case, German nationals living in China during World War II, having never lived in the United States, were accused of violating the laws of war. They were tried by a U.S. military tribunal in China, convicted, and sent to Landsberg Prison in Germany, then an occupied sector of Germany, to serve their sentences. Some of the convicts, including Eisentrager, questioned the legality of their trials and filed for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States District Court for the District of  Columbia, right here in DC, stating that the military's actions violated their rights as guaranteed by several portions of the U.S. Constitution, including article III of the fifth amendment. In denying habeas to these German nationals, the court expressly rejected the argument that enemy combatants detained overseas have a constitutional right to petition U.S. courts for habeas relief, noting that:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing in the text of our constitution extends such a right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It rejected the view that the U.S. Constitution applies to enemy war prisoners held abroad. The court claimed:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No decision of this court supports such a view. None of the learned commentators on our Constitution has ever hinted at it. The practice of every modern government is opposed to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where do we keep coming up with this idea that habeas is applicable to prisoners of war? I am baffled. The Court explained emphatically that such a constitutional entitlement would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort to the enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Habeas proceedings would diminish the prestige of our commanders, not only with enemies but with wavering neutrals. It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his own civil courts and divert his efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a pretty clear statement. How could it be otherwise? Congress authorizes a state of hostilities. We fund it. The President, as the Commander in Chief, the military commanders execute it, and now we have it in our heads somehow that the persons  our commanders are charged with reducing to submission have a right to sue us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court further held--this is in 1950--that the fifth amendment is inapplicable to aliens abroad and, in reasoning fully applicable to the suspension clause, explained "extraterritorial application of organic law" to aliens would be inconceivable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Writing for the majority, Justice Jackson, who was referred to by Senator Dodd and Senator Kyl--a great Justice on the Court--stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution does not confer a right of personal security or an immunity from military trial and punishment upon an alien enemy engaged in the hostile service of a government at war with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is pretty plain language, wouldn't you say? I think that is the plain language of the Constitution. It does not give them immunity from military trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even if, as opponents mistakenly argue, this amendment restores a statutory right to habeas, the Supreme Court has also held that Congress may freely repeal habeas jurisdiction if it affords an adequate and effective substitute or remedy. Essentially, if legislation strips habeas, according to the Supreme Court, the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person's detention, does not constitute a suspension of the right of habeas  corpus. In other words, if they provide some fair procedure for even prisoners of war that we decide is consistent with our military efforts and consistent with our sense of fairness, that does not confer and give a guaranteed right to a habeas corpus review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Military Commission Act of 2006 was drafted with these important Supreme Court precedents in mind. After careful negotiation among our Members and careful analysis of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Congress went above and beyond what was required by the Constitution and the Geneva Conventions to ensure detainees, even terrorists, at Guantanamo Bay, had an adequate and effective substitute method to test the legality of their detention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we did that. We did not fail to respond. We did that. The MCA provides alien enemy combatants far more legal process than has ever been afforded by any country in the history of armed conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not aware of a single country in the history of armed conflict that has provided more rights than our procedures that we have established under the Military Act that we passed and the President signed into law last October.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Combatant Status Review Tribunal for detainees is more robust than those to which lawful combatants, honorable soldiers in organized militaries of a foreign nation, are entitled to under the Geneva Conventions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me repeat that and drive home the importance of that concept. The Geneva Conventions were decided upon by a group of nations that came together and thought that during the course of military conflicts, too many things happened that are not justified and are not necessary and are damaging to people in ways that could not be justified. We wrote the conventions, the nations did, to try to ameliorate some of the problems in warfare. We said that if you have a lawful combatant, as part of the  Geneva Conventions, a person who has signed up for his or her country, fighting for the country, who wears a uniform, who carries his weapons openly and does not act in a surreptitious manner, does not act in a terroristic manner but fight battles according to the laws of war--if captured, must be treated and afforded the protections of the Geneva Conventions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a good standard of review and protection. Congress passed a law to provide for the people at Guantanamo, who are not lawful combatants but are unlawful enemy combatants and who have not historically been considered to have been covered by the Geneva Convention. We afforded them privileges that are not required even under the Geneva Conventions on how you handle detainees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about our present conflict, the war on terrorism. Former Attorney General John Ashcroft has made this point. If you think about it, it is worthy of our consideration. John Ashcroft is a great believer in American liberty, the rights of liberty, a key characteristic of the American people. But he points out we ought not to think about restraints that occur as some sort of a balancing test between liberty and control and domination. He says, when you engage in an action that is designed  to protect us, the test should be not a balancing test, but the test should be: Does it improve liberty? In other words, if you go to the airport and have to go through one of those checking stations as I did today, the question is: Do you feel more free to fly, having had that inspection occur? Is your liberty to travel, is your liberty to fly safely and securely in an aircraft in America, enhanced because you take a couple of minutes to go through that line? Or not?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If it is, then that is a protection of liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are indeed in a different world than we used to be, when threats fundamentally came from foreign nations. Now, even a few people with dedicated, malicious intent, with modern weapons of mass destruction and death can have tremendous impact on us. So what we are trying to do is execute lawful actions that improve our liberty, not deny liberty but to enhance liberty for all peace-loving and law-abiding American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk about Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. As part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress conferred on the Federal courts jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus. Though the language has gone through minor changes since 1789, current law, now codified at 28 U.S.C. section 2241, is essentially the same grant of habeas corpus as originally enacted. The statutory language has never referred specifically to enemy combatants because such a grant was understood not to apply to those individuals  detained during a time of war. Congress understood that detention of enemy combatants during time of war is strictly a military decision, since we do not allow enemy combatants to continue their war against us through the judiciary, through litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that habeas corpus does not extend to alien enemy combatants detained outside the United States, some argue that Justice O'Connor's plurality decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld changed this precedent. In that decision, Justice O'Connor said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All agree that, absent suspension, habeas corpus remains available to every individual within the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proponents of this amendment that we are debating cite this statement by Justice O'Connor as proof that habeas relief is available to all those detained within the United States, regardless of whether they are an alien enemy combatant. Let me note that during World War II, there were 425,000 enemy combatants held within the United States, none of who were allowed relief through habeas petitions. Furthermore, reliance on that statement by Justice O'Connor is wrong, since the question in Hamdi  was whether the executive had the authority to detain a U.S. citizen as an enemy combatant and whether that citizen detainee had habeas rights. Focusing on that narrow issue, the plurality referred specifically to the rights, in their opinion, the plurality opinion, of citizens, eight times in the opinion; and in the holding of the case--and the holding of the case is limited to the circumstances of the cases itself--Hamdi was, after all, a U.S. citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regardless, some advocates maintain that Justice O'Connor's otherwise inconsequential statement, too tenuous to constitute dicta, reversed years of settled precedent and for the first time granted habeas rights to illegal enemy combatants detained overseas. That proposition flies in the face of the commonsense interpretive rule that one does not hide elephants in mouseholes. Had the Hamdi Court intended to extend habeas rights to all individuals in the United States, not just citizens, including  suspected foreign terrorists detained outside U.S. territory, it most assuredly would have articulated such a consequential ruling with more clarity. But Hamdi did not present that question and the Court did not resolve it. Moreover, as the Court aptly noted, quoting Eisentrager:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such extraterritorial application of organic law would have been so significant an innovation in the practice of government that, if intended or apprehended, it could scarcely have failed to excite contemporary comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, had such a consequential holding been made in Eisentrager, it would have been met with prolific commentary from the legal community, from other Justices. It would have been an event, but that event did not occur--because it had no such meaning, of course, as evidenced by the lack of contemporary discussion. No decision subsequent to Eisentrager has reversed its holding that alien enemy combatants have no right to habeas protections guaranteed to American citizens by the U.S. Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, its holding remains governing law. Moreover, the issue now, if it ever could have been considered ambiguous, has been definitively resolved by the same judge who earlier granted Salim Ahmed Hamdan's habeas petition. Judge James Robertson, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, issued an opinion on December 13 in which he relied, in large part, on Eisentrager to justify his ruling that enemy alien combatants have no constitutional right to habeas corpus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Robertson, appointed to the bench by President Clinton, dismissed Hamdan's petition for habeas relief on the grounds that the MCA effectively denied his court's jurisdiction to hear the case; recognizing that Congress had removed Hamdan's statutory right to petition the D.C. Circuit Court for habeas relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Robertson also held:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hamdan's connection to the United States lacked the geographical and volitional predicates necessary to claim a Constitutional right to habeas corpus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, then, the Rasul case came along. Proponents of this amendment argue that they seek only to restore the right to habeas corpus as found by the Supreme Court in the 2004 case of Rasul v. Bush. Rasul took great pains to emphasize that its extension of habeas to Guantanamo Bay was based not on the Constitution, which clearly is a historic right we talked about on habeas, but it was based on some statute passed by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some Justices may have wanted to make Rasul a constitutional holding, but there clearly was no majority for such a position. Supreme Court cases such as Eisentrager are still the governing law on the constitutional reach of habeas and the Congress's ability to limit its statutory application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These precedents hold that aliens who are either held abroad or held here but who have no substantial connection to this country are not entitled to invoke the U.S. Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rasul was an unprecedented decision which effectively and truthfully seemed to fly in the face of all previous Supreme Court and English case law. Several Justices in this case engaged in what I would submit to my colleagues is activism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court extended the reach of the Federal habeas statute to Guantanamo Bay detainees. To my knowledge, this decision was the first time in recorded history that any court of any nation at war held that those whom its military had determined to be enemies had a right of access to its domestic courts and could sue the Commander in Chief to challenge their detention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court based its analysis on the phrase, "within their respective jurisdictions," as used in the Federal habeas statute and various decisions construing that particular provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the Court expressly distinguished between the statutory and suspension clause holdings of Eisentrager and limited its analysis to only the statutory grant of habeas. The Court determined that the measure of the Guantanamo lease agreement between the United States and Cuba allows for the jurisdiction of habeas claims since the United States exercises plenary and exclusive jurisdiction over the land on which the naval base is situated, although it does not have "ultimate authority."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the majority, I think and others think, mischaracterized the congressional statute as meaning that the writ of habeas corpus could be issued if "the custodian can be reached by service of process" and not the detainee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Justice Scalia accurately pointed out in his dissent, the majority:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>springs a trap on the executive, subjecting Guantanamo Bay to the oversight of the Federal courts even though it has never before been thought to be within their jurisdictions and thus making it a foolish place to have housed alien wartime detainees." &lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the decision opens a veritable Pandora's Box since it "permits an alien captured in a foreign theater of active combat to bring a section 2241 petition against the Secretary of Defense."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This case was a clear-cut example of, I believe, Supreme Court overreach. They seemed determined to do something about this. They wanted to do something about it. Apparently, they did not like it. So in straining to grant U.S. courts jurisdiction over terrorists held outside the United States, the Supreme Court determined, for the first time in history, that a simple lease agreement brought Guantanamo Bay within the jurisdiction of the court.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Read broadly, the majority opinion could be used to bring U.S. military bases and detention facilities across the world within the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts. Fortunately, in that opinion, Justice Kennedy did limit the application of the holding to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress, however, addressed the issue because, remember, this was based on the Supreme Court's interpretation of a statute Congress passed and which Congress changed, not on the Constitution ratified by the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So less than a year ago, Congress addressed the issue when it passed the Military Commissions Act, which precluded detainees from challenging their detention through habeas petitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if the Court relied on the statute as we wrote it before, we can change that statute, and we did. In doing so, Congress adhered to Supreme Court precedent and created an effective and adequate substitute in the form of a Combatant Status Review Tribunals and allowing detainees an opportunity to challenge the determinations made by the tribunals, even in the district court in the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it set up a Combatant Status Review Tribunal so they can bring and make their argument, and if they do not like the military's determination on that, they can get to a Federal court. That is not habeas, but it is a pretty good procedure, more than  ever has been given before to prisoners of war. So it seems we finally worked this thing out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 20 of this year, the DC Circuit Court dismissed all pending habeas cases from the Guantanamo Bay detainees for lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, on April 2 of this year, the Supreme Court denied a certiorari petition from the petitioners in Boumediene v. Bush and Al Odah v. United States, refusing to review their claims that the Military Commissions Act--that last year we passed--does not deprive courts of jurisdiction to hear their habeas corpus claims and that it would be unconstitutional  to do so, for Congress to pass it. They rejected that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court did not find it was unconstitutional, what Congress passed, and, in fact, found that Congress did what Congress intended to do, creating a substitute appellate process so prisoners could have a review of their detention but not give them the full panoply of habeas corpus rights provided to American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court, however, reversed itself on June 29 of this year and agreed to review both the Boumediene and Al Odah cases. This review could very well address the constitutionality of the habeas bars in the Military Commissions Act, and, much like this amendment, further undermine the executive's constitutional authority to detain enemy combatants in a time of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the Supreme Court will not do that, but they have agreed to hear that case and give it one more final review. Certainly, as of this date, the case authority is clear, that the Constitution does not provide habeas protection to noncitizen enemy combatants on foreign territory not part of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say that because people have come in on several points along the way and accused President Bush or the Attorney General or others of taking improper positions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In most instances, the courts have ruled in favor of the executive in these cases, on a few cases they found those procedures not to be statutory or pass muster. But what I will say to you is, in these cases, in almost each instance  they have reversed previous law. So the executive branch and our military was operating under what they had every right to consider to be the settled law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Court comes in and changes that law. I do not believe our military should be condemned or criticized for taking action they felt, and had every right to believe, was legitimate when they took it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it is important to remember that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay are the most dangerous people who we have captured on the battlefield pursuant to executive war-making power. They have been determined to be "alien enemy combatants" and the courts have absolutely no role to play, in my view, in trying to second-guess the wartime decisions made by the executive branch, especially where Congress has given their stamp of approval to the process. It is not the Supreme Court's role to micromanage  this war by making decisions that fall outside the scope of congressional authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decisions made by the Supreme Court have long-lasting effect and are not easily undone. If we are unhappy with present foreign policy, Congress can cut off funds for the war or people can vote the President out of office. I would note President Bush was reelected on a promise to continue to pursue with vigor the war against terrorism and the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life and are supposed to adjudicate the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress, not to legislate from the bench or to set foreign policy. This setting of foreign policy and conducting military operations are powers squarely within the purview of the executive branch not nine individuals with lifetime appointments sitting on a Court with black robes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not within the court's jurisdiction to decide on war-making decisions but simply the constitutional power. It is important to note the Justices lack the knowledge, in many cases, to address the matter, or have any experience to make these decisions. Have any of them ever served on the frontlines during war, or if they have, have they ever served in a war on terrorism or been a JAG officer or been a company commander, someone who captured enemy prisoners?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Court's opinion or personal views about this are not a matter that is impressive to me. We expect them to rule and to find Congress's statutes--we expect them to enforce the Constitution. But just to flip-flop around and try to decide that they do not like the way something is done at Guantanamo, and to issue an opinion, would be troubling to me. Hopefully, we will not get to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has to be clear, as I have shown, that if we apprehend enemy combatants in the theater of war, it is within the executive branch's power to detain them until the hostilities are over. This is a separation of powers issue, and the courts should recognize that. Congress has already addressed what should be done with those detained at Guantanamo Bay. Last October, we granted those detainees unprecedented rights that have never before been provided to prisoners detained during war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current system that we have provided them, detainees have essentially five layers of protection when challenging detention or determinations made by the Government. All of this is already covered by current law. It was never the intent of Congress, however, to endow the statutory guarantee of habeas corpus to alien enemy combatants held during a time of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we proceed with the amendment that is before us, we are not restoring the right of habeas corpus; we are effectively overturning 800 years of legal authority and precedent in this area. To quote the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I submit that 800 years of American and English court history certainly constitutes "super duper" precedent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allowing terrorists to challenge their detention through habeas petitions filed in the DC Circuit courts would undermine military decisions made by the Executive and essentially put wartime decisions regarding the detention of those apprehended while engaged in hostilities toward this country in the hands of judges who are not qualified to make the decisions. They are not empowered to make the decisions. This is exactly why the Founders vested the Executive with this type of decisionmaking authority--decisiveness  and ability to act quickly--and to undermine this power would be to trample on the Constitution we are sworn to defend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Voting in favor of this amendment would be undermining the Executive authority in times of war by making it virtually impossible for the military to detain dangerous terrorists affiliated with al-Qaida and with the Taliban during the war on terror and allowing Federal judges to force the release of detainees whom the military have determined to be extremely dangerous. It is just that simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed the Senate is proceeding forward with this amendment. I do not believe it is the right thing. It would result in an unprecedented grant of constitutional protection to those suspected of being terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This further indicates to me that our Congress is not in full comprehension of the seriousness of the war we are engaged in and the determination of those who are determined to kill us. It shows this body is, frankly, often unable to execute a military operation. We cannot get 535 people to execute a military operation and decide who ought to be detained and who ought not to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The military could go out and conduct a raid, and a firefight could break out, and eight people be killed and eight people captured. Thirty seconds before, they could have killed all 16. Now, if we detain them, we have to bring soldiers from the war field, present evidence of some kind, gather evidence to try to justify the detention. We all know quite a large number of those who have been released from Guantanamo have reappeared and been captured again on the battlefield trying to kill us. That  is a fact. We are not making that up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish these people in Guantanamo were the kind of people who would not go back to the battle. I wish they were all wrongly held so we could let them go home. But what if their determination is to continue to attack American soldiers, and it is your son out there, your daughter out there on the battlefield, and somebody says in the U.S. Congress, "We don't think you have enough evidence to hold them"? What do we know about what happened?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have given that power to the executive branch to conduct the war. That is who is supposed to be making those decisions. That is who is required to preserve and protect the security of the American people. I do not think that makes sense. It is not a little matter. It will set a precedent for future times. We are eroding the ability of the leadership of this country to execute and carry out a military operation, which by its very nature involves death and destruction of an enemy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have to say to my colleagues, we need to think this issue through. This may be a political deal now that we can use to beat up President Bush, but let me say to my colleagues, you had your victory in the last election, if not in 2004. We will have a new President soon. We need to get away from this personal and political perspective. We need to be thinking about the long-term history of the United States. We need to be thinking about other wars we may be involved in in the future. We need  to be asking ourselves: Are we creating a circumstance in which a devious, skillful, malicious enemy can utilize our very laws to destroy us, place at risk our own soldiers, place at risk American citizens, place at risk our people serving in military bases around the world?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be careful about that. We have provided them, by statute last year, a procedure to contest their detention. Large numbers of those who have been detained have already been released, and quite a number of those have been recaptured on the battlefield attempting to destroy America and what we stand for, attacking our own sons and daughters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to be careful. To say we need to restore the right of habeas corpus is not correct. We have never provided habeas corpus to enemies of the United States, for heaven's sake. I share again the overall concept that we are in a difficult new world. The Constitution provides for reasonable searches and seizures and such things as that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country is threatened, and our people's liberties are threatened. Liberty is important. Freedom is important. We in Congress do not need to be curtailing significantly liberty in America. We certainly do not need to be eroding constitutional protections that are provided to American citizens. We are not doing that. The Supreme Court has never held the Constitution provides protection in this fashion to enemy combatants. So we are not eroding the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have come up with is a realistic process that will, in the end, provide more liberty, more freedom to American citizens than if we were subjected to a system by which we are releasing terrorists again and again who are out to kill and destroy us. That is all I would say on the fundamental question of liberty and freedom and law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's get our thinking straight. Let's look at this issue carefully. Let's be sure we know that no country has ever provided such protections to enemy combatants. The fact that 50 out of 400,000 German prisoners who were tried after the war in Nuremberg had certain legal provisions and rights provided them in no way whatsoever should be construed to say we provided habeas rights to other prisoners during the course of a war. They were not provided to the 400,000 German prisoners held in the United  States, that is for sure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand some effort is being made to pursue the amendment offered by Senator Specter, which is very troubling to me because if it were to pass, it would reverse the Military Commissions Act of 2006 that we passed last September on final passage, 65 to 34. Passage of this amendment would result in a veto of the Defense authorization bill by the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first amendment we have up that is being pushed to a vote against the pleas of people on this side would result in a veto of the Defense authorization bill. The second amendment may well raise the same issue, I understand. Not only that, we have very controversial amendments that are being made filed to this bill and that have been offered for a vote on this bill which are very controversial and are not related to the defense of America--for example, the hate crimes amendment. People have  differing views on that. They have offered an amendment on hate crimes on this bill. There is also the amendment on the DREAM Act, which is an immigration amendment that would provide citizenship to people who come here in our education system at a certain age,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It raises questions in my mind whether there is any serious desire on the part of the Democratic leadership to see the Defense authorization bill passed. The bill came out of the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member, and it didn't have the reversal of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the grant of habeas corpus to illegal enemy combatants, noncitizens on foreign soil. It didn't have that or hate crimes or the DREAM Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just say to my colleagues that we need to do the right thing for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardsmen who are serving our Nation now. They are in the field this very moment. They are out walking the streets somewhere in Iraq--160,000 of them--executing this very complex and very important and, so far, effective counterinsurgency strategy that was devised by General Petraeus. They are living with Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi police and doing the things they were asked to do.  This bill has a pay raise for them and wounded warrior language that provides additional care for those who are wounded while serving our country. We owe them every single benefit we have to give them. We have military construction to make sure we are able to carry through on the BRAC process. It has acquisition reform. We need to do a better job with the money we spend in acquiring new weapons systems and aircraft and ships and all the things that go with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just say to my colleagues, let's remember now that everything is not required to be placed on this bill. If we pass this amendment to provide habeas corpus protection to illegal enemy combatants, not citizens, not on American soil, not required by the Constitution of the United States, according to decided case authority of Federal courts, that is going to result in a Presidential veto even if it passes. Hopefully, we won't pass that. Why do we want to do that? We need to be spending our time  thinking about how we can help those whom we have sent into harm's way to execute a policy that has been decided upon by the Congress of the United States. That is what we need to be doing--not creating more and more lawsuits, not engaging in more and more political flapdoodle and emotional arguments about restoring habeas corpus, when we have never provided habeas to prisoners of war in the history of the Republic, nor has any other advanced nation provided those kinds of rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to push back from this brink. Let's don't take action that could result in the failure of a defense authorization bill. It would be the first time we have failed to pass a defense authorization bill since 1961, 46 years ago. Let's don't break that record while we have soldiers in harm's way serving our national interests, attempting to execute the policies and assignments we have given to them. Let's don't do that. Let's don't pass a bill that is going to come back like a  ball off of the wall because it will be vetoed by the President. What good is that? Why are we obsessed with this? It wasn't passed in the Armed Services Committee, and it doesn't need to be pushed now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to become fully aware of the dangerous territory which we are entering. We are entering a circumstance in which, if we continue to pursue issues unrelated to the core responsibilities of the Congress to deal with the war we are confronting, we will have failed in our responsibilities and actually fail to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we need to finish up with the Defense bill and go on to the Defense appropriations bill. The fiscal year ends September 30. We need to pass the Defense authorization bill so that we can get to the Defense appropriations bill by next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That needs to move. We do not need to still be arguing over the DREAM Act, arguing over hate crimes, arguing over providing habeas corpus rights to illegal enemy combatants held somewhere around the world by the American military, a privilege that has never been provided by any nation to people it captures on the battlefield. That is not the right way for us to go. This Congress, if it is a responsible Congress, should move forward this week on the authorization bill and do the appropriations  bill next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are the core issues? We have some core issues we ought to debate about the defense of America and our military. Let's stay on those issues, not on extraneous issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that we have heard the report of GEN Jimmy Jones's commission, the Government Accountability Office report the week before last, and then last week we heard from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. We need to have time to discuss seriously--and this side has certainly agreed to that and it is contemplated that we will have a generous time to discuss our commitment in Iraq, what it is, what our goals are, how we can achieve those goals, what the troop levels should be, how  they are going to be drawn down, are they being drawn down fast enough, and what other issues are relevant. Those are legitimate issues on which we should spend time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very concerned these other issues will be distracting us from those issues, that we will be utilizing time that ought to be on the core issues of  defense of this country, and I hope those leaders, particularly our Democratic leadership, are not going to put us in a position where we will not meet our responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 46 years, we have passed a Defense authorization bill. At the rate we are headed, even if we pass it, it is going to be vetoed because of amendments wholly unrelated to the Defense of this country. We need to pass a Defense appropriations bill, and we need to get on that quickly because the fiscal year is ending. For my colleagues' information, we are going to have to do something to continue to fund defense because if we do not pass a Defense authorization bill, the fact is that  no money can be spent in the whole Department of Defense unless we are being attacked. It is very troubling, and it could have tremendous disruptive impacts throughout the entirety of our defense establishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Antideficiency Act, if Congress does not appropriate money, the executive branch cannot spend it. It cannot spend what has not been appropriated. That is the Constitution, and that is what the Antideficiency Act says. The budget and last year's appropriations end September 30. We need to pass a new bill so we can go forward into next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a pretty good bill that came out of committee. There will be some disagreement here, there, and on a few other matters. We will bring those up, and good people will disagree. I certainly understand that point. We need to be working on those issues, not being distracted on matters unrelated to the core of defending America in this time of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share those thoughts and hopefully our colleagues in the leadership can continue to work and some way we can avoid the end toward which it appears we are heading.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I heard one of my friends on the other side of the aisle come here this afternoon and talk about why we aren't getting more things done here; why are we doing the Defense authorization bill now; when are we going to do the Defense appropriations bill. Maybe they should have thought of that before they did 45 different filibusters here in the Senate. The Republican minority has stopped the work of this country. We have fought back with the very slim majority we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remind everyone within the sound of my voice that Senator Johnson has been ill. He is back now, thank goodness. He is back. He overcame a tremendous illness, and he is back with us. My majority was 50 to 49--that is, the Democratic majority--and we have had to fight, that little majority has had to fight everything that we have done. Everything. We had to file cloture on things they agreed with us on, just eating up valuable time here in the Senate. I am going to have to file  cloture again tonight on another matter. This will be the third time we have worked on the Defense authorization bill. I am not going to belabor the point except to say this is the wrong thing to be talking about here: Why aren't we moving more quickly?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of all the obstacles--procedural in nature--they have thrown up against us, we have done some remarkable things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President was forced to sign, even though he didn't like it--and he said so--the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform in the history of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed the 9/11 Commission recommendations that the President held up for years. And those he tried to implement, he got D's and F's on, but they are now law. We have done that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Disaster relief for farmers and ranchers--we have done that for them. They waited years to get that done. Our slim majority was able to get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We forced upon the President money to fight the wildfires which swept the West, fires caused by global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A budget. We passed a balanced budget. Our majority was 50 to 49, and we passed a budget. The Republicans, with the huge majority they had, couldn't get a budget done. We got one done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, we have done some really good things here in spite of all these obstacles. I haven't mentioned all of them but just given an idea of what we have done working really hard. So I repeat: Don't come to the floor and lecture us on not getting things done here.</paragraph>

The Republicans had to debate us. This war went on for years, and there wasn't even a congressional oversight hearing held. We have held hearings, and they have been opened up to this country. We helped uncover the scandal of Walter Reed, just to mention a few of the things we have done on Iraq, plus forcing on the President money to get body  armor for the troops so the parents no longer had to buy them and up-armoring of vehicles we have forced upon the President.</paragraph>
