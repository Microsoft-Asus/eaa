  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor a community in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 5-8, the residents of Cooperstown will celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cooperstown is a vibrant community located in east-central North Dakota. The town was founded in 1882 by Rollin and Thomas Cooper, who had previously been miners in Colorado. As with many communities in North Dakota, the arrival of the railroad in 1883 contributed greatly to Cooperstown's growth. The town's post office was established on December 28, 1882. The town continued to grow, becoming incorporated as a village in 1892 and as a city in 1906.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Cooperstown plays host to manufacturers, agricultural businesses, and many other local companies. Cooperstown is also proud to boast a strong community, with chapters of 4-H, the American Legion, and the Boy and Girl Scouts of America, in addition to several local community organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tourism opportunities abound in Cooperstown. Sportsmen seek out hunting and fishing near Lake Ashtabula and the Red River Lake. The Cooper Theater hosts local plays, and the Griggs County Museum provides a window on Cooperstown's past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Cooperstown, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Cooperstown and all the other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great tradition of the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Cooperstown that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cooperstown has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
