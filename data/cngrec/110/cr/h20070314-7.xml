  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Friday's The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, detailed the dire consequences of setting artificial timelines for withdrawal from Iraq. The editorial states that it would be tragic if the rug should be pulled from under U.S. forces by the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The political message coming from House Democrats threatens to throw efforts to stabilize Iraq off balance. As The Post and Courier, where I was a former reporter, concludes, General Petraeus should be given the time and forces he needs to succeed, and not a legislative recipe for failure. Democrats and Republicans should be united to remember that al Qaeda spokesman for Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri, has clearly identified that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in the global war on terrorism.  Bin Laden has specifically stated, "The most serious issue today for the whole world is this Third World War that is raging in Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
