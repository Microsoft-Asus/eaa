    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="584">H. Res. 584</bill>, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Life Insurance Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="584">H. Res. 584</bill>, which has 87 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Judy Biggert on July 30, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="584">H. Res. 584</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, studies have found that when an unexpected death occurs, insufficient life insurance coverage can cause significant economic hardship for the loved ones left behind. The lack of sufficient coverage drives many family members of the deceased to work additional jobs, borrow money, prematurely withdraw money from savings and investment accounts, and in many cases to move to less desirable housing. It is estimated that 68 million Americans say they lack the life insurance coverage needed  to ensure a secure financial future for their loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the goals and ideals of National Life Insurance Awareness Month because it will make people more aware of their insurance needs and motivate them to seek information about obtaining life insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Judy Biggert, for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague from Illinois, Danny Davis, for managing this resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 584, which supports the goals and ideals of designating September 2007 as National Life Insurance Awareness Month. I also would like to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski), for introducing this resolution with me for the fourth year in a row and for his support on this important issue. Congressman Kanjorski serves with me both on the Financial Services Committee  and the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus and has been an outstanding leader on the important issue of financial security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank the gentleman from California, Chairman Henry Waxman, and the gentleman from Virginia, Tom Davis, for moving this resolution through the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, last, I would like to acknowledge and thank Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia for their contributions to this effort. They worked with those of us on this side of the Capitol to craft identical resolutions that garnered both bipartisan and bicameral support. It's my hope that the Senate will soon pass its version of the resolution soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, life insurance too often is thought of only when it is too late. How many times have we heard friends or loved ones who are sadly reflecting that the deceased had no life insurance or had too little life insurance? Today, only four in 10 adult Americans own an individual life insurance policy; and among those who do have life insurance, the amount often is too small to safeguard the financial future of their loved ones. Because of insufficient coverage, family members often are forced  to work extra jobs or longer hours, borrow money, or move to less desirable housing. In short, these outcomes are only symptoms of the crisis of underinsurance that exists in our Nation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 584 calls on the Nation to observe the month of September as Life Insurance Awareness Month. The Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education, the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, the American Council of Life Insurers, and a coalition representing hundreds of leading life insurance providers and advocates have designated September 2007 as Life Insurance Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our collective goal for this month is to make consumers more aware of their life insurance needs, seek professional advice, and take the actions necessary to achieve financial security for their families. Many of my colleagues on both the Financial Services and the Education and Workforce Committees have been working very hard to increase the level of financial literacy and economic education in this Nation. Understanding how financial products work and how they work to build financial security  are two important ingredients in a complete financial education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that recognizing Life Insurance Awareness Month will motivate Americans to seek out information about the benefits of life insurance so that if premature death of a loved one does occur, they will be spared the economic hardships that often accompany tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and support the goals and ideals of designating September National Life Insurance Awareness Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will close and just simply reemphasize the importance of this legislation. Again, I want to commend Representative Biggert and yourself, Mr. Speaker, for leading the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think many people think of resolutions like this as a simple something that has taken place; but I am reminded that in the community where I live and work, oftentimes people will die and not have the wherewithal with which to bury themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our young people will be killed and their families take up a collection to get them buried. And so I think that this is a very important resolution. I commend both of you, once again, for its introduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="584">H. Res. 584</bill>.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The yeas and nays were ordered.</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.</chair>
