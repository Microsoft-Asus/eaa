  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the last week, we have heard that President Bush is finally going to admit tonight what most of us have known for many years, that global warming is actually occurring and that we as a Nation need to take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight's expected pronouncement from the President is welcome news, but it does not excuse the administration's past record on global warming. Over the last 6 years the Bush administration has served as a major roadblock to reversing dangerous warming trends. The President walked away from international efforts to help reduce the growing danger to our planet, refusing to actually lead on this critically important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of New Jersey, we are proud of the fact that former Governor Richard J. Codey took decisive action over a year ago to strengthen our State's efforts to combat global warming by classifying carbon dioxide as an air contaminant. This action made New Jersey one of the first States in the Union to take such a step. By contrast, the Bush administration has been in constant denial that environmental dangers to our planet exist. So, therefore, we hope that the Nation will take this  seriously.</paragraph>
