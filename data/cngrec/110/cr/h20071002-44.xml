  <narrative>
    <bill type="h" number="3432">H.R. 3432</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Commission on the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> (1) On March 2, 1807, President Thomas Jefferson signed into law a bill approved by the Congress "An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States" (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the "1808 Transatlantic Slave Trade Act") and made it unlawful "to import or bring into the United States or territories thereof from any foreign kingdom, place or country, any negro, mulatto, or person of colour, with intent to hold, sell,  or dispose of such. . .as a slave, or to be held to service or labour".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution clearly spelled out that the international slave trade could not be banned before 1808, and it is only on January 1, 1808, that the 1808 Transatlantic Slave Trade Act went into effect.</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) An Act entitled "An Act to continue in force `An act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy,' and also to make further provisions for punishing the crime of piracy", enacted May 15, 1820, made it unlawful for any citizen of the United States to engage "in the slave trade, or ....., being of the crew or ship's company of any foreign ship ....., seize any negro or mulatto ..... with the intent to make ..... a slave ..... or forcibly bring ..... on board  any such ship .......".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The transatlantic slave trade entailed the kidnapping, purchase, and commercial export of Africans, mostly from West and Central Africa, to the European colonies and new nations in the Americas, including the United States, where they were enslaved in forced labor between the 15th and mid-19th centuries. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) The term "Middle Passage" refers to the horrific part of the transatlantic slave trade when millions of Africans were chained together and stowed by the hundreds in overcrowded ships where they were forced into small spaces for months without relief as they were transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) During the Middle Passage, enslaved Africans resisted their enslavement through non-violent and violent means, including hunger strikes, suicide, and shipboard revolts, the most historically-recognized events taking place on board the Don Carlos in 1732 and on board the Amistad in 1839.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Scholars estimate that, at a minimum, between 10,000,000 and 15,000,000 Africans survived the Middle Passage, were imported as chattel through customs houses and ports across the Americas, and were sold into slavery.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The thirteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States recognizes that "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) The slave trade and the legacy of slavery continue to have a profound impact on social and economic disparity, hatred, bias, racism, and discrimination, and continue to affect people in the Americas, particularly those of African descent.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) In 2007, the British Parliament marked the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the former British Empire with plans launched by the Department for Education and Skills which provided joint funding of &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the Commission on the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) ensure a suitable national observance of the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade by sponsoring and supporting commemorative programs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) cooperate with and assist programs and activities throughout the United States in observance of the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) assist in ensuring that the observations of the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade are inclusive and appropriately recognize the experiences of all people during this period in history;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) support and facilitate international involvement in observances of the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) study the impact of the transatlantic slave trade on the United States and the Americas.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is established a commission to be known as the "Commission on the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade" (referred to in this Act as the "Commission").&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4.

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Lantos, for moving this bill through expeditiously, and also the cooperation of our friend, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), for assisting in the moving of this bill through our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that January 1, 2008, will mark the 200th anniversary of the Act to Prohibit the Importation of Slaves, which effectively ended the legal transatlantic slave trade. I am proud to be the sponsor of <bill type="h" number="3432">H.R. 3432</bill>. The Bicentennial Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade Commemoration Commission Act of 2007, is the total title, to honor the victims and survivors of the transatlantic slave trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us establishes a commission to cultivate and preserve the memory of a grave injustice in American history, the transatlantic slave trade, and to mark the trade's conclusion at the hands of our President at that time, Thomas Jefferson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early years of the Republic, the transatlantic slave trade constituted a thriving economic vein of the United States. By 1807, millions of Africans had been captured and transported to the Americas on notorious slave vessels. We may recall "Roots." The 30th anniversary of that is being lived out now, which so vividly showed that era. As a matter of fact, it was the most watched series on television, even today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many individuals perished as a result of torture, including rape, malnutrition and disease. Those who survived faced miserable prospects of a lifetime of bondage. Few Americans are aware that captured slaves resisted their enslavement until the bitter end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Middle Passage, enslaved Africans defied their slave masters through nonviolent and violent means, including hunger strikes, suicide, and shipboard revolts, the most historically recognized events taking place on board the Don Carlos in 1732 and on board the Amistad in 1839, that famous case that was defended by John Quincy Adams, who argued and won the case and had the enslaved people released in Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 3, 1807, President Thomas Jefferson signed into law the Transatlantic Slave Trade Act, which prohibited the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States. The bill was nothing short of revolutionary. It single-handedly outlawed the longstanding and brutal trade of transporting Africans to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In commemoration of President Jefferson's act and to explore the impact of the slave trade on the United States, we will move this legislation which is drafted that will establish the 200th Anniversary Commemoration Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important body will be tasked with the mandate to plan, develop and execute programs and activities appropriate to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, which we will tend to start talking about "slave trade" as "enslaved people," which is a new definition that is starting to be used. Slaves are now considered people who were enslaved people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission is timely, and the subject is critical. The United States is a primary voice on trafficking issues today, and we are aware also that the principal advocate for human rights and freedom around the world that we stand so strongly behind. Our Nation's willingness to confront its past and calmly assess the impact of enslaved people on the United States strengthens our ability to serve as an advocate on the international stage. I strongly urge the support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the poet Maya Angelo once said, "History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again." I find these words fitting as we consider <bill type="h" number="3432">H.R. 3432</bill> today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 200 years, countless Africans died in brutal conditions during the so-called Middle Passage, the overseas voyage of their lives to enslavement in America. The United States formally prohibited the importation of slaves nearly 200 years ago, although the institution of slavery persisted in this country for another 50 years afterwards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will establish a commission to ensure that this important anniversary is appropriately commemorated within the United States and also abroad. In essence, the bill seeks to ensure that all Americans, no matter their age, race, gender, culture, or even religion, are afforded the opportunity to learn more about the institution of slavery and its vestiges so that we may understand this tragic aspect of history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we cannot unlive our past, it is hoped that this commission will promote greater tolerance and understanding among all Americans, while shedding light on the fact that slavery still exists in the modern world. Yes, even 200 years after the transatlantic slave trade was abolished, slavery still goes on. It exists through human trafficking and wherever any group of people is systematically robbed of its fundamental human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand in support of <bill type="h" number="3432">H.R. 3432</bill>, in the hopes that this commission will help Americans confront the past with honesty, while committing themselves to the eradication of modern-day slavery in all of its forms, no matter where it may be found.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me once again thank all of those responsible for moving this bill through. As you recall, it was in 1807 that slavery was abolished in England through the work of Mr. Wilberforce, who for 20 years argued against slavery in the British Parliament. A resolution was passed this year by Mr. Pitts commending the abolition of slavery in Great Britain and commending Mr. Wilberforce for his work as a great abolitionist. So we are pleased that this will give us time  to commemorate, to investigate, to remember those who had this difficult period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been indicated, even though transatlantic slavery was abolished in  1807, slavery continued. As a matter of fact, even in the North, and our State has found records that even after the Emancipation Proclamation and as late as 1866, the last slave was freed in New Jersey. Many people are unaware of the fact that there was slavery in New Jersey, which abolished slavery, but you had to be 25 as a man and 21 as a woman, and any children born of a  union had to remain in slavery. Therefore, people remained in slavery up through after the Emancipation Proclamation, which only freed slaves in the Confederacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me thank the distinguished chairman of the committee. I rise enthusiastically to support the present legislation on the floor, because we have had a rocky time, Mr. Speaker, over the last couple of months, and we have raised in the current light that race and history are not relevant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful that the most powerful lawmaking body in the world has now come to the floor to acknowledge the slave trade and all of the ramifications, from its beginning to its ending, because we have been told over the last couple of months that there is no concern to a young African American male still being incarcerated in the State of Georgia and that race is not an issue. We have been told that there is no problem to the existence of the Jena Six, and that race is not an issue. Likewise,  we have been told that inequity in our school systems that impact heavily on African American and other minorities is not an issue of race, and many times it is. So to be able to rise to debate this question of recognizing the impact of slavery and the slave trade and its relationship to our international allies and their history with it is extremely important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I, in my comments, as I support the underlying bill, thank the chairman for his leadership. I thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee. I particularly thank the chairman for his leadership on remuneration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the previous bill, very briefly, I would like to acknowledge my support for the remuneration of those families that suffered in the tragedy of the African Embassies, who did not get a response, did not get coverage, did not get a response from the Federal Government for 9 years after this tragic incident where they lost their loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee and other members of the full Committee on Foreign Affairs for understanding that the moneys had to be raised to compensate for the grief and pain that these particular family members now hold dear to their heart. That legislation was long in coming, and it is crucial that we did it under this Democratic majority Congress. We pressed the administration to sign it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I would finally like to comment, Mr. Speaker, that my delay was because we had a hearing, at the same time as this legislation, on Ethiopia. Having just come back from Ethiopia, I know how hard Mr. Payne has toiled. I, frankly, am concerned on the recent legislation that I know has just passed that we would have an indictment of a chairperson who has shown nothing but love and affection for the continent of Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said in my remarks that we need to be big boys and girls. The world arena of diplomacy is a tough business, and we need to be able to have tough love. We need to be able to love the people of Ethiopia and its opportunities, but we likewise need to know that we need to be able to promote human rights, we need to be able to have an independent judiciary, we need to be able to have a move toward democratization and a recognition of the brilliance of Prime Minister Meles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have to address the concerns of the people, and I am grateful that amendments that I offered in that legislation now on the floor were accepted, that we have greater exchange between U.S. and Ethiopian judiciary, that we begin to look at changing property ownership from Ethiopia to the people. I saw that firsthand in Ethiopia. And in the discussion we had in the committee, it is important that we look at the Somalia-Ethiopian border and the people caught up in that crisis and begin to  fight for humanitarian rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is crucial. I believe that this legislation that passed just prior to my coming to the floor, I believe the legislation on the terrorist victims whose families were lost in the African Embassies 9 years ago, and this legislation, begins to address nationally and internationally that America understands that this Congress will not abnegate its responsibility to, one, affirm its commitment to the continent of Africa, but also to understand the questions of race, and that race should not be  negated for the crisis that we face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for your leadership and also for the acceptance of my amendments regarding the Ethiopian bill. I still, in the name of Mickey Leland, have a love and affection for Ethiopia and will continue to work with a degree of tough love with Ethiopia. I hope that the message that came forward, that you can't be harsh, you have to handle it with kid gloves, is very tricky and that it does not keep us from fighting for those incarcerated, fighting for those who are in need  of humanitarian needs, and affirming the value of Ethiopia as it fights with us in the war against terror, and in Sudan. Why should we be afraid to give tough love? It will help the people of Ethiopia. That is what we are looking for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ethiopian Americans, bring us your roadmap so that we can work together and make not only the United States the best country in the world, but work with Ethiopia as it aspires to be a shining star of democracy on the continent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3432">H.R. 3432</bill>, the 200th Anniversary Commemoration Commission of the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade of 2007, which I am proud, along with over 90 of my colleagues, to cosponsor. This legislation recognizes the 200th anniversary of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, and it establishes the rubric from which the Commission, to be known as the "Transatlantic Slave Trade 200th Anniversary Commission," shall be formed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Congressman Payne, for introducing this important legislation, as well as the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Congressman Lantos, for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, though 200 years have passed since the abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, the legacy of slavery continues to have a profound impact on American society. The legacy of social and economic disparity lives on, as do hatred, bias, and discrimination. Despite two centuries of progress, the African American community continues to feel the impact of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, and subsequent years of racism and persecution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our Nation has pursued the ideals of liberty and equality for all, there still remain steps that must be taken in order to ensure that even such a dark piece of our Nation's history be preserved and its conclusion at the hand of President Thomas Jefferson be celebrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill before us establishes a commission to cultivate and preserve the memory of a grave injustice in American history, we must recognize and in some small way try to rectify our past. In the early years of the Republic, the transatlantic slave trade constituted a thriving economic vein of the United States. By 1807, millions of Africans had been captured and transported to the Americas, many perishing as the result of torture, rape, malnutrition, and disease. It was not until  March of 1807 that President Thomas Jefferson signed into law "An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States," a Congressionally approved bill intended to end the heinous practice of the transatlantic slave trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in commemoration of President Jefferson's revolutionary act, and to explore further the impacts of the slave trade on our Nation that <bill type="h" number="3432">H.R. 3432</bill> establishes the 200th Anniversary Commemoration Commission. This import commission will be composed of 11 congressionally appointed members charged with the task of planning, developing, and executing programs and activities appropriate to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>January 1, 2008 will mark the 200th anniversary of the "Act to Prohibit the Importation of Slaves." The United States today serves as a moral compass for the rest of the world and as such we must provide a voice for human trafficking issues. Our willingness to confront our Nation's past and to address the impacts of the slave trade and its legacy on the Unites States strengthens our undeterred commitment to serving as an advocate for human rights and freedom in the international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3432">H.R. 3432</bill> which establishes the  200th Anniversary Commission of the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. It was 200 years ago in 1807, when first the British Parliament and then the U.S. Congress abolished the then 300 year old practice of forcibly removing Africans from their homes along the Western coast of that continent to provide free labor for the empires of Europe in the New World.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The triangular trade would link the peoples of Africa, Europe and the Americas in a chain of blood, power, money, imperialism and despair and set the tone for our modern day relationships as none of our ancestors were left untouched by its sheer brutality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time it was all over, the world's first massive attempt at globalization, would profoundly change it from corner to corner and would leave behind many of the social reverberations of race, class and poverty that we as a world community struggle with today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we recognize this momentous anniversary and the way it has shaped the lives of African descendants in the Western Hemisphere, and as one of those descendants I want to take the opportunity to call attention to the end of enslavement of Africans in my own district, the U.S. Virgin Islands, which was then the Danish West Indies. The abolition of the slave trade did not immediately end slavery. It was not until 1848 in response to an uprising by enslaved Africans demanding emancipation that slavery  was ended there. It is a day which we celebrate on July 3rd of every year, and this year will be the 160th Anniversary of that important event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach that anniversary it is relevant to note the dialogue that the people of the Virgin Islands and the people of Denmark have embarked upon regarding reparations--not in terms of monetary compensation, but in education, restoration and reconciliation efforts that can finally close that sad chapter of our history and our relationship. While discussions have not taken place at a government to government level, we anticipate that these will begin in the near future and we look forward  to the opportunities this could make available to both sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, returning to the resolution before us, it is important that we mark the end of this dark period in world history and human relations and that we study and commemorate the events that led up to the beginning, the middle and the end of slavery. It is important that the civic, historical, educational, religious and economic activities planned on the state and national levels be used for the American people to look back and seek understanding of that time and the legacy that it has left  behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we commemorate with speeches and conferences and exhibitions, let us remember that there is still human trafficking taking place today and that we should be as adamant and as vigilant as our forbears of 200 years ago, in seeing to its end.</paragraph>
