    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life and legacy of Senator Daniel Baugh Brewster. I was a great admirer of Senator Brewster, and I hold the Brewster seat in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brewster was a true patriot. He was a hero at the age of 19 when he volunteered for the Marine Corps and was sent to the front lines of the war in the Pacific. There he served bravely--leading the 1944 assault on Guam and the 1945 assault on Okinawa. He bore the wounds of war like so many of our heroic veterans. He was wounded seven times and had a permanent scar on his forehead from a bullet that lifted his helmet and grazed his scalp while battling for Sugar Loaf Hill on Okinawa. For  his bravery, he was awarded a Purple Heart, two Gold Stars, and two Bronze Stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with many World War II veterans, Senator Brewster came back a changed man. He was disappointed when some of his neighbors in Green Spring Valley voiced outrage at him for inviting African-American friends he had served with during the war to his home. This experience further fueled both his desire to run for office and his lifetime commitment to civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brewster graduated from University of Maryland School of Law in 1949, and was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1950. After serving two terms, Senator Brewster ran for and was elected to represent Maryland's Second District in Congress in 1958. In 1962, Mr. Brewster was elected to the Senate. He was just 39 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate, Brewster was a champion for civil rights. He cosponsored the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and served as the stand-in candidate for President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 Presidential primary campaign in Maryland against segregationist candidate George Wallace of Alabama. The contest was seen as a crucial battle in the fight for civil rights. Despite threats to his family, he campaigned vigorously and won the primary for President Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brewster served as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the time the war in Vietnam was escalating. Publicly, he took a hawkish position on the war, but privately he expressed concerns about the war and shared those concerns with President Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving the Senate, Senator Brewster devoted his time to his family, farming, and volunteering. He was an original director and former president of the Maryland State Fair and chaired the Governor's Commission on Alcoholism and the Governor's Commission on AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brewster's congressional legacy lives on today as two of his Senate interns from Maryland, Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, went on to prestigious political careers of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my heartfelt condolences to Senator Brewster's family and to his friends and to all those whose lives he touched. Senator Brewster's family is in my thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
