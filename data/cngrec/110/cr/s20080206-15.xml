  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to talk about the economic stimulus  package we are discussing in the Senate. I certainly appreciate the concern the President and all of us have in the House and Senate about our economy and wanting to do everything we can to make sure we avoid an economic slowdown or recession that creates so much hardship through the loss of jobs and, in many cases, a loss of homes. It is something we definitely need to address.  It is equally important, as we look at our economic situation, to make sure we allow economic growth and prosperity to work for more people. It is not just about our economic situation as a whole growing but making sure everyone can share in that prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important, as we look at the best way to stimulate the economy and keep it going, to remember that good jobs and a good economy depend on successful companies making good profits. In order for that to happen, we have to create a good business environment. Our goal as a Congress should be to make sure America is the best place in the world to do business. Unless we do that, we will continue to lose ground to countries all over the world. It is going to be increasingly difficult to sustain  long-term economic growth. The world is becoming increasingly competitive. We hear it every day. We hear from Asia and India which are actually courting businesses with incentives to encourage companies to locate in their countries, creating a good business environment with less regulation and less taxes so that people will bring their manufacturing plants, their people, and their capital to their countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is this country not responding in the same way? It hasn't been too long since I have been in the private sector working with businesses. I continue to hear the same sentiment. If we are going to do business in America today, before we get to the equipment and the people actually making the products or providing services, a medium-sized American company today is likely to have a large tax department. It could spend millions on dealing with our Tax Code. We have the most complex tax system  in the world and probably the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Some will say it is second. Some say it is first. But we are definitely near the top at around 35 percent. So they start with a large tax department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then most of our companies also have large legal departments because we are the most litigious society in the world. The most liability for any country is to do business in America. It is not unusual to talk to successful, well-known American companies that are dealing with hundreds, if not thousands, of lawsuits at the same time. So they keep a full-time fleet of lawyers and law firms on retainer dealing with the lawsuits and the legal situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These same companies also have large human resource and compliance departments to deal with all of our regulations--some of them good, many unnecessary. A lot of regulations related to capital and reporting, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, are costing companies millions of dollars unnecessarily because Congress is unwilling to fix those things we know are wrong. So there is a large tax department, a large legal department, a large human resource compliance and regulatory department, before we get to  manufacturing and actually making things. We are making it very difficult for our companies to compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Add to that the cost of energy which is one of the highest in the world. That goes back to bad policy as well. For years we have known we have large oil and natural gas reserves. We have known we could develop more nuclear generation of electricity. Yet we have not allowed nuclear plants to be developed. We have large reserves of oil in Alaska, which we have consistently voted down in the Congress, and natural gas we don't go after. Therefore, we are not only spending hundreds more for every  family for gasoline for cars or oil to heat homes or more for electricity, we are sending hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of this country that could support our economy yet is supporting the Middle East and other economies around the world. Yet we will not change the policy. We will not develop our own energy resources. Instead, we are making it harder to produce automobiles in this country, putting the burden on them consistently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, instead of trying to fix some of the systemic policy problems, we are talking about an economic stimulus plan which I have yet to hear, at least on the Republican side in our private meetings, one Republican defend as good policy. Maybe some will come out here and do so. But everyone on both sides is talking about good politics. We are doing nothing for long-term growth. We are doing nothing to create a simpler, more predictable Tax Code or reducing our regulation or litigation. What we  are going to do in time for the election is to get a check in the hands of as many people as we can, and we are borrowing it from the future. The debt is growing. We are going to borrow the money to send checks home to Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 10 years on the present course, bonds for the American Government will be rated as junk bonds in the world because we continue to look at the next election rather than the future of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is obvious what we could do to develop a long-term, sustained economic growth pattern. If we made the current tax rates permanent, the ones we know have stimulated our economy, that would allow companies to plan past 3 years to build new plants, to buy new capital equipment, to hire new people. Right now American companies trying to do business in this country do not know what their tax rates are going to be after 2010. In fact, if we do nothing in Congress, they know they will experience  the highest tax increase in history. Yet we are not even willing to talk about it. All of us know we need to lower our corporate tax rate to at least be comparable to Europe at 25 percent. Yet we are not doing it. So more of our capital, more of our jobs, more businesses will continue to move offshore. Sending people a few hundred dollars to pay down their credit cards is not going to help grow our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other things we know we can do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know we can bring capital from overseas back home for investment and growth if we lower the corporate tax rate as we did a few years ago, what we call repatriating those dollars. Even temporarily lowering that rate would bring capital home and encourage growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one part of the stimulus package that does make sense is to allow companies to expense or to speed up depreciation of capital they buy so it will encourage them to grow and make decisions now because the people who make that equipment have jobs, and those who operate that equipment have jobs. So it would provide some stimulus. But it is most important that we have a predictable, permanent system where people can do business and be competitive around the world. It is unfortunate in all this  debate that we are not even willing to talk about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the time to express my concerns. I am thankful everyone is concerned about the economy and those who have lost their jobs and may lose them in the future. But what we are doing as a Congress is talking about doing something that we are not really doing: we are not stimulating the economy. This is not an economic stimulus package. It is a political stimulus package that is designed to help folks in November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know every American needs a check and probably none will turn it down. But, unfortunately, we are making false promises that will not carry into long-term economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
