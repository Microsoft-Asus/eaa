  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today for a happy occasion to congratulate the St. Cloud Cathedral High School Crusaders for winning the Class 2A High School Baseball Tournament Championship in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a thrill, Mr. Speaker, when the Crusaders came from behind in the final inning, in a most dramatic 7-6 victory over the great students from Glencoe-Silver Lake. It doesn't get much better than this in Minnesota, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The championship is a long tradition of success for the Cathedral students. And over the course of 13 State appearances, the Crusaders have come a way with six State titles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This continued success of the program for the Cathedral Crusaders is no doubt due to the steady leadership of the head coach, Mr. Bob Karn who, in his 37 seasons of coaching the Crusaders, brought his team once more to a great victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that this body would join me in congratulating Coach Karn and the Cathedral Crusaders on their Class 2A State Baseball Championship.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
