  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="FIRST LIEUTENANT JACOB N. FRITZ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army 1LT Jacob N. Fritz of Verdon, NE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Fritz graduated from Dawson-Verdon High School in 2000. His peers and teachers recognized him as a natural leader. He was active in every extracurricular activity his school offered: speech, drama, basketball, football, track, and band. He organized drug-free parties and dances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After high school, Lieutenant Fritz followed his dream of serving in the Armed Forces by enrolling in the Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 2005. His younger brother, Daniel, followed in his footsteps and is currently a third-year cadet at West Point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Fritz had been serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, assigned to A Battery, 2nd Battalion, 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, based in Fort Richardson, AK. On Saturday, January 20, 2007, Lieutenant Fritz passed away when his dismounted patrol received indirect fire followed by small arms fire in Karbala, Iraq. He was 25 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1LT Jacob Fritz is survived by his parents, Lyle and Noala Fritz of Verdon, NE, and his two younger brothers, Daniel and Ethan. I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Lieutenant Fritz. He made the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our Nation. I join all Americans in grieving the loss of this remarkable young man and know that Lieutenant Fritz's passion for serving, his leadership, and his selflessness will remain a source of inspiration for us all.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="SERGEANT MAJOR MARILYN GABBARD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor SMA Marilyn Gabbard of the Iowa Army National Guard. The first woman ever promoted to the rank of Command Sargent Major in the Iowa Army National Guard, Sergeant Major Gabbard was deployed to Iraq on December 16, 2006, and died in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crash on January 20, 2007, at 2:45 pm local Iraq time. Her colleagues said of her that she was a role model for other women in the Iowa National Guard, and her rise through the enlisted  ranks was inspirational. She is remembered as a respected soldier and caring leader who always put her soldiers first. Her military decorations include three awards of the Meritorious Service Medal. My prayers go out to Marilyn's husband Edward and her seven children and stepchildren, her mother Mary Van Cannon, as well as her grandchildren and all her family and friends.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="SERGEANT TOMMY RIEMAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Army SGT Tommy Rieman, a native of Independence, KY, who received the military Silver Star for exceptional courage. He exhibited this courage when insurgents attacked his reconnaissance squad near the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq on December 3, 2003. His selfless act of bravery and unwillingness to fail exemplify the true definition of a soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Rieman grew up in Independence, a small town in northern Kentucky. While at Simon Kenton High School, he was captain of the football team and was a member of the wrestling team, before he graduated in 1999. Sergeant Rieman was a teenager, pumping gas at a local gas station when he decided to enlist in the Army. This monumental decision he made to begin his exceptional military career would go on to shape his destiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving in Iraq, Sergeant Rieman showcased immense calm under pressure, when his squad came under attack by insurgents. With the convoy under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades and explosive devices, he used his own body as a shield to protect his squad gunman and returned fire to the enemy. The humvees that the squad was traveling in did not have any doors, so as a result Sergeant Rieman suffered two bullet wounds and multiple shrapnel injuries. Despite these injuries, he was still  able to direct the convoy off the road and away from the live fire combat, only to be attacked by another smaller group of insurgents. Sergeant Rieman commanded and led his squad to return fire, and the enemy's weapons were silenced. At this point, the situation was calm and he was able to call a medical helicopter to treat the injuries of these brave soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After returning from Iraq, in August 2004 Sergeant Rieman was awarded a Silver Star for his brave actions that day in Fort Bragg, NC. He is now employed as an administrative assistant for the Army personnel office in the Pentagon. In May 2006, he was selected to be a participant in the "America's Army: Real Heroes" video game program, which recounts the lives of military soldiers who have shown heroism and bravery in the war on terror. Sergeant Rieman will have his military history and motivational  story told through this game, with the hope of inspiring others to greatness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 23, 2007, Sergeant Rieman was a guest of the First Lady and was formally recognized by President Bush, who discussed his bravery in the annual State of the Union Address to Congress. He stated that Sergeant Rieman, like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, had earned the respect of the Nation. I cannot agree with this statement more. It brings me great pride to see a soldier of the caliber of Sergeant Rieman represent Kentucky in such a courageous and selfless  way. He is an inspirational example to me and to the entire Commonwealth.</paragraph>
