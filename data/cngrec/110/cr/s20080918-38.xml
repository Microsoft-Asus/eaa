  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO THE POLYNESIAN VOYAGING SOCIETY -- (Senate - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9015">S9015</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the Polynesian Voyaging Society. For more than a quarter century, members of the Polynesian Voyaging Society have dedicated much of their lives to voyages of exploration and discovery that have retraced every major migratory route of the ancient Polynesians. These voyages are not recreational but rather journeys that illustrate the scientific prowess of the Polynesian people and the strong connection between science and culture. Their  commitment to the legacy of oceanic exploration seeks to integrate traditional voyaging into quality education. The Polynesian Voyaging Society has renewed interest in maritime exploration and reawakened Native Hawaiian pride in environmental awareness and ocean stewardship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's age of modern technology, much can be learned from the past. Hawaii's past and future will always be intimately tied to the ocean for recreation, commerce, and transportation. The society exemplifies the importance of raising awareness of and protecting the unique treasures Hawaii's culture offers, and serves to enlighten a new generation of young people. Its members are truly a testament to Hawaii's oceanic heritage.</paragraph>
