    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service of the Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent, Joe Alston, who is retiring this week. Joe is a man of considerable integrity, ability, and achievement, and his presence at the Grand Canyon will be deeply missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 31 dedicated years, Joe Alston is retiring from the National Park Service. He has spent the last 6 years serving as the superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park, the crown jewel of Arizona and one of the Nation's oldest and most heavily visited National Parks. Joe has held a wide variety of positions in the Park Service beginning with his first job as a seasonal firefighter on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. In the years that followed, Joe worked as a concessions specialist at  Yellowstone National Park and later became the chief of the Concessions Management Division in the Alaska Regional Office. More recently, Joe Alston was the assistant superintendent of Yellowstone National Park and eventually served as superintendent at several major National Park units such as the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, the Curecanti National Recreation Area, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and the Rainbow Bridge National Monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are very fortunate to have benefited from the passion and expertise that Superintendent Alston brought to the Grand Canyon. Joe was challenged with many complex issues and longstanding conflicts ranging from park transportation to aircraft overflights, yet he has managed them all with foresight, thoughtfulness, and resolve. Under Joe's leadership, the Park Service saw the completion of the Colorado River Management Plan, which protects park resources by implementing a new river permitting  system that balances competing commercial and recreational interests. Despite its highly contentious nature, it was Superintendent Alston's desire to hear and understand the views of river runners and other constituents by affording the public every opportunity to provide input during the CRMP planning process. Few superintendents in National Park Service history have undertaken such an open nationwide approach that concluded with such remarkable success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Grand Canyon has received many honors during Superintendent Alston's tenure. In 2004, Grand Canyon National Park was recognized for a number of environmental accomplishments by EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt, including having the first EPA certified Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design "green building" owned and operated in a National Park. Joe was the driving force behind the implementation of new training programs that led to the reduction of visitor and employee injuries which  earned the Park the Regional Director's Safety Excellence Award and the Director's Safety Excellence Award for Public Safety Achievement in 2005. Among the many accolades Joe has received over the years, perhaps the most noteworthy came in 2005 when Secretary Gale Norton awarded him the Meritorious Service Award, the second highest honorary recognition granted to Interior Department employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joe Alston's ties to the Grand Canyon extend beyond his outstanding professional career. Indeed, the Grand Canyon also happens to be where he met his wife, Judy, who is a teacher with the Grand Canyon Public Schools System. Joe is regarded by those living in northern Arizona as an individual deeply connected to the community. Just last month, he accepted the Community Person of the Year award from the Grand Canyon Rotary Club for ushering in a new era of partnership between the communities of  Tusayan, AZ, and Grand Canyon National Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My son and I had the distinct pleasure of hiking the Grand Canyon rim to rim last year with the accompaniment of Joe Alston. I can think of few others alive today who are as knowledgeable and devoted to the history and culture of the Grand Canyon than Superintendent Alston. I wish Joe the very best in his future goals and ambitions.</paragraph>
