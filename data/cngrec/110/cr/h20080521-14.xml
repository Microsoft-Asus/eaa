    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, without the 1944 GI Bill, I would not be standing here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GI Bill educated my dad after he came home from World War II. And today is his 86th birthday; so happy birthday, Dad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GI Bill paid for his tuition, his room, his books, some living expenses. It paid for his college degree. It helped him lift our family from the Depression into the middle class, and it offered my two brothers and me a brighter future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of Americans have stories that are just like mine. In all of the many ways that America shows gratitude to our veterans, the GI Bill has to be one of the greatest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was honored last week to vote to extend and to renew the GI Bill to the new generation of veterans that are coming home. The GI Bill was always meant to be a permanent promise, a contract with our soldiers, a bill of rights for our veterans. And I certainly urge the Senate and the President to pass this bill into law as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Happy birthday, Dad.</paragraph>
