  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to congratulate Intelligent Spatial Technologies, a company founded by a tremendously innovative young entrepreneur from my home State of Maine. Intelligent Spatial Technologies of Orono is a software and data company that was launched in 2003 by Christopher Frank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The successful operation of Intelligent Spatial Technologies is a beacon to all young entrepreneurs who dream of starting up their own business. Mr. Frank founded Intelligent Spatial Technologies while a student at my alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono. While there, he worked with an all-University of Maine alumni team to grow and develop an innovative idea he dreamed of to provide location-based information on-the-go. After graduating from the University of Maine, Mr. Frank applied  to become a tenant in the Target Technology Incubator. Supported by the University of Maine, the Community College System, and the Maine Small Business Development Centers, the Incubator offers early-stage tech-based companies the training and tools necessary to make their ventures a success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the help of Target Technology Incubator and over a million dollars in Federal and State research grants, Mr. Frank was able to realize his idea and transform it into a new, vibrant business in the State of Maine. Today, Intelligent Spatial Technologies is a leading developer in the fast-growing industry of location-based services, which is a particularly remarkable achievement when one considers that the current market value for GPS-related products is an estimated $12 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notably, Intelligent Spatial Technologies was able to successfully market its first product, the iPointer, to the University of Maine. The iPointer is an advanced device that empowers users to explore a defined area by pointing at landmarks and receiving feedback in the form of text and audio-visual images over a wireless Internet connection. The University of Maine used the product to provide prospective students with informative, custom tours to familiarize them with the university campus.  The iPointer is the cornerstone of Intelligent Spatial Technologies and a unique contribution to location-based services industry. It is terrific to see that Mr. Frank wants to expand the use of his creative technology to more everyday uses, such as use with digital cameras, cellular phones, and hand-held computers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before concluding, I would be remiss not to mention that Christopher Frank was named Maine's Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration in 2006. His cutting-edge technology and stellar leadership is highly respected in the Bangor community. Not only does Mr. Frank show leadership as president and founder of Intelligent Spatial Technologies, but he also is a founder of FUSION Bangor, an organization which aims to engage young people in community leadership through  forums, meetings, and similar events. Mr. Frank has shown that no matter what your age, you can have an impact on both the business community and the local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Maine is incredibly proud of Intelligent Spatial Technologies. To see a college student realize his business dream--while still a student, no less--is always inspiring. I wish Christopher Frank and everyone at Intelligent Spatial Technologies continued success.</paragraph>
