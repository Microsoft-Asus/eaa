    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1338">H.R. 1338</bill>, the Paycheck Fairness Act. The author has introduced this legislation for the last 10 years. It's time that we stand together for the fair payments act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is 2008, and yet our wives, daughters, sisters still face gender-based wage discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to advocate for equal pay because this is not a women's issue. This is an American issue. Discrimination on wages based on gender is unacceptable. Congress has a duty to tackle this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The wage gap hurts families' ability to pay for basics like groceries, child care, health care. Today 41 percent of women are heads of households and are sole income earners. We're in a recession. People have lost their homes right now. The gap continues to be there. Gas prices continue to go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1338">H.R. 1338</bill>, and allow for all women to receive fair treatment and equal opportunity.</paragraph>
