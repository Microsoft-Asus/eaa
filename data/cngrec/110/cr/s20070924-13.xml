    <paragraph>Mr. President, a lot is being said about whether Ken Burns included enough Latinos in his new television series on World War II. This is one more reminder that "pluribus" comes easy, but "unum" is hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be a lot easier if "e pluribus unum," the national motto displayed above the Presiding Officer's desk in the Chamber, were reversed and became "many from one" instead of "one from many."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ken Burns's epic series on "The War" began last night on public television. It promises to stick in our collective memory as only a few television events have--for example, the Roots series, Burns' own Civil War series, and Super Bowls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, our country is so splintered these days and so enthralled with our diversity that not very much becomes collective memory, as did, for example, McGuffey's Reader in the 19th century, or the three network newscasts in the mid-20th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This diminution of our common core of beliefs and experiences is America's fundamental challenge because forging unity from our magnificent diversity is America's greatest achievement and has created our capacity for other achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Library of Congress some weeks ago, reflecting on his 6 years of work on this television series, Ken Burns said Americans were more united during World War II and its aftermath than at any other time. It was no coincidence that during this era the "greatest generation" also accomplished the most: Welcoming new citizens based upon beliefs instead of race, building overwhelming military power and the best universities, and producing nearly one-third of the world's wealth for 5 percent  of the world's people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quoting the late Arthur Schlesinger's book, "The Disuniting of America," Ken Burns said America today could use "a little less pluribus and a little more unum."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following World War II, liberals such as</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Schlesinger, Albert Shanker, and Hubert Humphrey were vigorous apostles of America's common purpose. Their Fourth of July speeches were as effusive as anybody's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today, the left disdains, and the right seems to have forgotten the importance of unum, which means we are abandoning our greatest achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see this in our work in the Senate. There is no constituency for consensus, only for division, and many of those who work hardest for consensus are retiring or near the end of their careers here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A good example is the debate on Iraq, a war that, unlike World War II, divides us instead of unites us. The President is conducting the war the way he wants to conduct the war, not recognizing that persuading at least half the people he is right is the only way he can sustain a long-term U.S. presence in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic majority, on the other hand, is working hard for a perceived political advantage, not recognizing that most voters would prefer we work together when Americans are fighting and dying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both sides deserve an "incomplete" on their report cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A unified country would speak with one voice on where we go from here in Iraq because our troops deserve to hear it; because the enemy needs to hear it; because one political party does not go to war, our country does; and, finally, because the Senate looks downright ridiculous lecturing Baghdad about being in a political stalemate when we cannot get out of one ourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still have an opportunity to speak with one voice on Iraq. Seventy-eight of us in the House of Representatives and the Senate--35 Democrats and 43 Republicans--have cosponsored legislation making the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommendations the policy of our Government. It is a consensus most Members, I believe, agree with. It is sitting there staring us in the face, waiting for us to adopt it and the President to sign it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At West Point a few weeks ago, 30 cadets told Ken Burns, after they had seen some of his World War II series, that they had watched his Civil War series with their parents and had decided then to attend West Point. We can only hope that Burns' new series can have as much impact and remind us of that time--World War II and its aftermath--when Americans pulled together, and remind us that today we could use a little less pluribus and a little more unum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of the 78 cosponsors of the Iraq Study Group recommendations, on <bill type="s" number="1545">S. 1545</bill> in the Senate and <bill type="h" number="2574">H.R. 2574</bill> in the House.
