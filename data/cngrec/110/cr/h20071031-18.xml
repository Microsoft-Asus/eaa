  <narrative>OUR CHILDREN'S HEALTH -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12243]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program is one of the most effective government programs of the last decade. For an investment of just $3.50 a day, we can ensure health care for that child who would otherwise fall through the cracks because their family makes too much for Medicaid but can't afford private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This small cost is significantly less than the cost we all bear when uninsured children fail to receive preventative care and end up in our emergency rooms. Yet the President and about 10 of his Republican House supporters are all that stand in the way of covering 10 million American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bipartisan legislation will allow children who are already eligible for the program to see the doctor of their family's choice so they don't have to resort to an emergency room for their primary care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is time for our Republican colleagues in this body to join us in ensuring that all American children have a healthy start in life. The future success of our Nation depends on the health and well-being of our children. It is time for the obstructionists to get out of the way. Let's get the job done.</paragraph>
