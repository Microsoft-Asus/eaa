  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, why is it that we have so many Republicans here in the House, a veto-proof majority in the Senate, a poll that came out showing that Republicans across this country support expansion of the SCHIP bill by a 2 to 1 margin. Why is that? Because the expansion of the SCHIP bill is not just morally responsible. It is fiscally responsible. We have to stop pretending that these kids that don't have health care insurance don't have health care. They do. But they  get it in the least humane and most expensive way. We have a system of universal health care in this country. It just doesn't get care to these kids until they are so sick and so crippled by their illness that they show up at an emergency room and get the worst care and most expensive care that you can get in this system</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from a morally responsible district, but I also come from a fiscally responsible district, Madam Speaker, and that is why they support expansion of the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
