    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in recent months the number of unsafe products imported to the United States from China, ranging from seafood and pet food to toys and toothpaste, has grown steadily. Chinese-made products have accounted for 60 percent of recalls this year, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>China's small-scale food producers have been accused of unsanitary production, conditions, using tainted or substandard ingredients, and failing to register with the authorities. About 350,000, or 78 percent, of China's food processing operations employ 10 people or less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans are rightly concerned when they learn many of the products imported from China pose a threat to their health. American consumers have grown to expect that the products they buy at their local markets are safe for their entire family. That is why it is vitally important for Congress to hold hearings on these issues to better examine how we can protect our constituents from substandard Chinese products.</paragraph>
