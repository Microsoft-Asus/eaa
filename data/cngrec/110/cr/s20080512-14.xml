  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak about energy prices because this is a national crisis; it is a matter this Congress needs to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prices are at record highs. According to AAA, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline this morning was $3.71 a gallon. For an average family with two cars, that could well mean $70 to $100 a month extra money out of their budget to get the same number of gallons they bought 2 or 3 years ago. This is particularly troubling since 60 percent of the oil we import comes from abroad, and a big portion of that money the American family pays is going to foreign governments hostile to the United  States, in some instances. And, it is just not healthy. In my view, it also cannot be disputed that this wealth transfer is a major factor in the economic slowdown we are experiencing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question we in Congress have to ask is, What are we going to do about it? I believe there is a simple answer with many complex parts. The simple answer is, let's get busy doing what works, what we know will work. Certainly, let's not do things that make the situation worse, that is going to drive up the price of energy even more, and that is being proposed in this Senate. It is time to take a long road back to a sound energy policy that can and will bring down the price of gasoline. Permanently?  I don't know. We see economies around the world growing, nations such as China that have about one automobile for every 20 people, and we average two automobiles per family in the United States. They are coming into that. They are going to continue to grow, have more cars. South America is growing. Other areas of the world are growing. They are utilizing more energy. They have bigger houses and they have more automobiles and the supply is not going to be able to continue to increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to talk about the reality today and the fact that I believe energy prices are higher than they need to be, and there are some things we can do to improve them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has done some things. We increased fuel efficiency. Last year we passed, and the President signed into law, the Energy Independence and Security Act. Among its provisions, this measure raises the CAF&#xC9; standards, the automobile mileage standards, to 35 miles per gallon for an automobile manufacturer's entire fleet by 2020. That is moving. We think we can do that. I supported it. I believe we can get to that goal. I am confident we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to this step of going to 35 miles per gallon, CAF&#xC9; standards were just 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles and 22 miles for light trucks and SUVs. So raising the standard to 35 miles overall will certainly reduce oil demand by ensuring that we travel further per gallon of gas, we get more benefit from each gallon of gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope Americans, looking at the prices and looking at our national interest and not being so dependent on foreign oil, will seek ways in their own families to save money for themselves and help America by reducing unnecessary utilization of energy. Yet reducing demand through increased efficiency is not the only solution. Our population is growing, and other factors are at work. We are not going to be able to conserve our way out of this problem. We use more energy as the population grows and  as people make more money. In order to produce this additional energy, more must be done to increase clean American production of energy. We can do that. The United States has significant reserves of oil at home, and this Congress has the ability to allow these reserves to be produced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Department of Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, approximately 119 billion barrels of oil exist on and offshore in the United States. Remember, we produce 40 percent of the energy we utilize today for automobiles. That is  liquid energy, and we can produce more of it. It will have an impact on the global price if we increase in the months to come the amount of oil we produce at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing traditional energy sources of oil is not the only way to increase the supply and reduce the cost of gasoline. The United States has an immense supply of unconventional oil called oil shale. The Congressional Research Service--that is our independent research service in Congress--estimates this country's oil shale reserves to be the equivalent--hold your hat--the equivalent of approximately 2 trillion barrels of oil--trillion barrels. We utilize about 5 billion a year. That is eight  times the amount of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves. And we also have an abundant supply of coal which can be converted into gasoline using technology currently proven in South Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a step we need to work on and to take. We realize we have to do clean coal, we have to do clean technology in the oil shale area, and we have to understand that it will probably create more CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 than just producing a barrel  of oil from Saudi Arabia and burning it in our automobiles because it has to be heated. But in the short term, we are very unwise, as we transition away from oil, if we do not consider coal to oil and shale to oil, both of which, I am told, can be brought in for around $50 a barrel, less than half the world price. We simply have to consider that as we go forward. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. Government, the people of the United States, spent $237 billion on imported oil in 2007. It is estimated this year, 2008, we will spend $412 billion on imported oil, and the price seems to continue to go up. Indeed, 12 months from today, it may well be over $500 billion for imported oil. This is money that could be churned in our economy paying American workers good wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet Congress has consistently blocked the development of this Nation's oil resources. I have been here for 12 years. I know how it went down. I have been part of the debate over ANWR and gulf offshore drilling. We finally, 2 years ago, were able to open some areas in the Gulf of Mexico. But we have huge reserves of oil and gas off our coasts throughout America, and we need to do a better job of allowing that to be available so we don't have to buy so much from abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Biofuels can play an important role in keeping the cost of energy down. Despite the claims of detractors, ethanol and biodiesel do reduce our dependence on foreign oil to a significant degree. They keep money at home because this energy is generated here and, as I indicated with Senator Harkin, it creates jobs in Iowa, in Alabama, and keeps that wealth at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people may ask: Why aren't we producing American energy if it can reduce the price of gas? And I think improved efficiency and conservation, combined with an increase of supply, can have more of an impact in breaking this boom of oil prices than a lot of people think. It does not have to be unprecedented reserves of oil coming on the market in a short period of time, but a lot of this is speculation, a lot of this is a shortage of supply, and if the demand drops down because people  conserve and we can get the supply up a measurable degree and get above that demand with our supply, the ability of these foreign nations and oil companies and speculators to manipulate the price falls completely. The reason they are successful in seeing prices surge is because we have too tight a margin between demand and supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opposition to producing more oil and gas at home has been hypocritical, frankly. While opponents of American energy--the same ones who complain the loudest about high energy costs--they also object to producing more gas and oil in the United States, but they do not object to producing it, apparently, in places such as Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. It is all right to import it and buy it from them. And while they object to production--and by a narrow margin we were able to open the gulf this  summer, finally, some--but while they object to production offshore in so many areas of our country and in Alaska, citing environmental concerns that I don't think are realistic and I think are exaggerated, they show no regard, I suggest, for the production of oil offshore in places such as Nigeria or Indonesia or production in the Caspian Sea or the Persian Gulf or the North Sea or off Venezuela and in a lake in Venezuela.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, we have a great record of environmental stewardship, far superior than most of these countries. Our oil companies would operate their production under the strictest environmental rules in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even during Hurricane Katrina, not too far from my hometown of Mobile, AL, out in the gulf, not one of the oil platforms leaked. Their safety systems worked as they were designed to, safely shutting off the wells below the surface. Most of them are back up and running today. Producing American energy creates funding for environmental projects throughout America, throughout Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. These are the four States that have agreed to offshore production. Our States  are able to obtain environmental moneys as a part of that agreement we approved 2 years ago. In Alabama, this funding has been used for wetlands preservation, restoration, and educational purposes. Instead of sending our wealth to foreign countries to build palaces for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, this Senate will vote on the American Energy Production Act of Senator Pete Domenici. This measure--and I cosponsored it, and others have--is a step in the right direction. It is not the complete solution, but it is something we can do now.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 additional minute to wrap up.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This is a step in the right direction. It would suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, invest money in establishing new batteries that will allow us to move to more fuel-efficient electric automobiles--plug-ins, hybrids--utilizing nuclear power. It will produce more offshore and in Alaska and help reduce that $400 to $500 billion wealth transfer that is occurring in our country today and that is impacting adversely our national economy and impacting adversely the family  budget.</paragraph>
