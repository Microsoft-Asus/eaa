  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Ms. Gloria Hughes for her committed service to Nevada. Ms. Hughes will be retiring on June 30, 2008, after over three decades of service in the Mineral County Assessor's office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Hughes began her service in 1973 as a deputy clerk. She then served as deputy assessor, senior deputy assessor, and chief deputy assessor. In 1994, she was elected to her first of four terms as assessor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As sssessor of Mineral County, Gloria has worked tirelessly to improve the quality and efficiency of her office, never losing heart when she encountered obstacles. For example, Gloria won a 12 year battle to obtain an office vehicle, which helps the staff fulfill their appraisal duties throughout rural Mineral County. Ms. Hughes' realization of this goal and others like it ensured that her office was consistently the best it could be. Indeed, the State department of taxation repeatedly gave the  Mineral County Assessor's office perfect marks in every category of methods and procedures of tax assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>True to her nature, Ms. Hughes expresses regret that she will not be able to see all of her goals for Mineral County realized, but is optimistic that the dedicated employees she leaves behind will fulfill them when the time is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gloria will be missed by her employees--whose best interests she worked for ceaselessly--and the citizens of Mineral County who were the fortunate beneficiaries of her fervent commitment to her job, her county, and her state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful to Ms. Hughes for her service and proud to honor her and her achievements.</paragraph>
