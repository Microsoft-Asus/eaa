  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I note the passing of a most distinguished and  talented Idaho artist and businessman, Fred I. Ochi, on February 18, 2007. Fred lived in my hometown of Idaho Falls and was best known throughout Idaho and the West for his beautiful paintings; barns were one of the trademark subjects of his Japanese-influenced art. Although known for his art work, Fred's life reflected a penchant for perseverance, business, and appreciation of  the importance of art to communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred, a Japanese American, was born in California in 1913. After losing his mother at the young age of eight, Fred and his brother spent 3 years in Japan living with their grandparents. He returned to California where he studied art and became a theatre manager in the San Francisco Bay area in the 1930s. He found a public place for his artwork back then--movie marquees of the 17 theatres he managed. Due to the war, Fred was evacuated from California in 1942 and moved to southeastern Idaho, where  he managed marquees for theatres there. Fred was an unfortunate victim of one of the darker periods in Idaho history; he had to be escorted by Idaho National Guard troops when people organized a protest against the theatres based on Fred's ethnicity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred continued his life's work in Idaho Falls. He settled there in 1943 and spent the rest of his life working there, raising his children with his wife Yoshiko. The man who completed 10,000 watercolors over the course of his lifetime opened a commercial art and sign shop, and was a founding member of the Idaho Falls Art Guild. In Idaho Falls, he served as a longtime member of the Chamber of Commerce and the Kiwanis Club. Fred left an indelible mark on arts in Idaho. He served as president of  the Idaho Art Association and earned the 1998 Governors Award for Excellence in Art. During Idaho's State Centennial, Fred was named one of the "100 Citizens Who Made a Difference for the State."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred was generous with his talent, sharing it with students of all ages throughout Idaho and western Wyoming. Fred's ready smile and sense of humor was well-known: his business cards read "Smiling Irishman, Fred O'Shay." My sister Christine knew Fred well. Knowing of her interest in art, Fred would invite her to watch him work at his studio, the "log hut." She remembers his painting style as fast and powerful; he used many different brushes with big brush strokes. It was intentional and bright,  like his personality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fellow Idaho Falls artist Gloria Miller Allen observed:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always remember him in old white dress shirts slightly spattered with paint, and with his glasses spattered as well. I can still see him in his red kimono selling paintings down by the river. Idaho Falls will miss this good man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fred's legacy lives on in his 5 children, 11 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. He will be sorely missed, and I offer his family my condolences and our gratitude for sharing Fred and his art and legacy with us all.</paragraph>
