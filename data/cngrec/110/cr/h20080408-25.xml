    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 1020, recognizing the tremendous service that members of our Armed Forces have provided to the country, especially those who have been wounded in combat. I thank our colleague from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and their families are making extraordinary sacrifices in service to our country. Over 4,500 servicemembers have made the ultimate sacrifice in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Nearly 32,000 servicemembers have been wounded, of which a little over 17,000 have returned to duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, servicemembers have an unprecedented chance of survival, unlike those who had similar wounds in Vietnam and the Second World War. The medical advances that have taken place on the current battlefield have made these significant achievements possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, while members are surviving their injuries and wounds at an unprecedented rate, they are coming home with more complex psychological injuries. These individuals who have honorably served our Nation may need medical care and assistance for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 1020 commits this Congress to ensuring that these brave, wounded warriors receive the best medical care available, and commends all Americans who volunteer to support these wounded warriors and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, I again commend our colleague from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for his introduction of this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1020, as amended, which recognizes the tremendous service that members of the Armed Forces have given to the Nation, especially those who have been wounded in combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, throughout our history, America's sons and daughters have been called upon to fight our Nation's wars to preserve our freedom and our way of life. Each time we have gone to war, these brave men and women who answered the call, unfortunately, have been wounded and injured; 204,002 in World War I, 671,846 in World War II, 103,284 in Korea, 153,303 in Vietnam, and 467 in Desert Storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Madam Speaker, as we continue to fight terrorism throughout the world, 30,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have been wounded and injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. As with  previous generations, these men and women are our Nation's finest, and we owe them more than just our gratitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress and the American people have made it clear that our combat wounded deserve the best our Nation has to offer. To that end, Congress has worked hard to ensure that the needs of the wounded troops and their families are met. From the best health care to jobs, to education benefits, the Members of this House have and will continue to insist that the support to the wounded and injured is unsurpassed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is no question that serving in combat is a profoundly life-altering experience. Men and women who survive the horrors of combat return home forever changed. Our Nation is eternally indebted to the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who fight to preserve our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is right and fitting, Madam Speaker, that today we recognize the service and the sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces who have been wounded while serving this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank my friend and colleague from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for introducing this resolution, and I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400641" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Welch, from Vermont.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of House Resolution 1020. Thanks to advances in modern technology, many American soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have lived through events that would have previously cost them their lives. Of the 1.6 million servicemembers that have been deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom, in Operation Iraqi Freedom since September, 2001, more than 30,000 have been wounded in battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The numbers are staggering, but we are here today to acknowledge that these wounded warriors are not just statistics; they are men and women from across the country who have faced unique situations and struggles, and they have individual stories to tell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last summer I had the honor to meet a young man from my district who was injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Iraq that killed three other soldiers riding in the same HUMVEE. He suffered extensive injuries, including a broken back and elbow, and underwent two surgeries at a hospital in Germany before being transferred to Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quick reaction by the medics meant that instead of being paralyzed, he can now walk again, but only after extensive surgeries and painful rehabilitation. This young man is actually a lucky one. He was able to recover with the help of a caring family and a supportive wife. There are many others that are not as fortunate, and it is our responsibility to provide them with the best physical and emotional support possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last year, Congress has taken many steps to enhance the quality of care of our veterans, including passing the largest increase in veterans' health funding in history, but there is still more to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this legislation, we do a simple but necessary thing; we take a moment to thank the men and women of the Armed Services who have been wounded in the line of duty and for their service and their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support passage of House Resolution 1020.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), the original sponsor of this very important resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Guam, my cosponsor and traveling companion, the new Member, the distinguished Member already from Virginia, my cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, they have said it pretty well. There's nothing that we can say or do that will acknowledge our appreciation for the sacrifice that the men and women of the uniformed services have given to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are acknowledging here is that we have a common commitment to meeting the needs of those soldiers and sailors and airmen who return from active duty. What we are also acknowledging is that in this war, very much unlike past conflicts, our soldiers, benefiting from this extraordinary battlefield medicine, are returning with extraordinary injuries. That is what they will have to live with for the rest of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us have had the opportunity to visit some of these soldiers out at Bethesda, out at Walter Reed. We are trying, in this small gesture, to acknowledge the sense that all of us have in Congress of our debt and our obligation and our appreciation to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, next week, we are going to have a group of these servicemen and -women visiting us in the Capitol. I'm going to be joining with my colleagues here today to welcome those men and women of the uniformed services to this Capitol, and I will encourage all of us to join in welcoming them personally to thank them for their sacrifice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise with my colleague from Vermont to voice strong support for <bill type="hr" number="1020">H. Res. 1020</bill>, which expresses the commitment of this Congress to our injured heroes, ensures they're receiving the highest quality of health care available and encourages all Americans to show support and appreciation for our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I want to take time to thank all of the servicemen and -women and their families for their sacrifices. I know the pride of having a son serve in the United States military, and my wife, Sue, and I pray every day for the safety of our fighting men and women abroad and here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our soldiers go into battle, we can all agree that they deserve the best training, equipment, and necessary resources to accomplish their mission. Congress has an obligation to care for America's wounded heroes when they return home from the battlefield. I believe the least we can do is to provide the highest quality medical care to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces when they're injured defending the freedoms that we enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, we have more wounded warriors returning home than ever before because of improved medical technology and advanced equipment to transport our sick and wounded. The thousands of men and women serving in the military who have been wounded serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and other wars deserve the best treatment and care available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my colleagues in a nonpartisan manner to make sure Congress delivers on our responsibility. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="1020">H. Res. 1020</bill> and support our wounded warriors.</paragraph>
