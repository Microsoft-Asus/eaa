    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to eulogize a friend and a former member of the Senate family, Kent Shearer, who died on August 23.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kent Shearer and I were boyhood friends from our early days in Russell, KS, when we were debaters at the high school. Kent was a great intellect. At the time when his colleagues were playing marbles, Kent was studying and talking about the Peloponnesian wars. During our high school days, Kent and I were colleagues in our freshman year debating the subject on the negative: resolved that individual income should be limited to $25,000 annually. Shows you how times have changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kent and I were on two high school debating teams which won the State championship. In 1945, Russell was a small school with fewer than 400 students. We competed with schools our size, then moved the next year to the big-school category, where high schools had several thousand students across Kansas, finished in second place, and lost by a speaker's ballot. Then, in 1947, we were on the team that won the State AA championship with the big schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kent was the outstanding debater in Russell High. He won the Kiwanis award, went on to the University of Kansas, where he was Phi Beta Kappa, was the winner of the Perdue National Invitational Debate Tournament, competed in the West Point National Tournament, served then in the Judge Advocate General's office, and settled in Salt Lake City, UT in 1958, until 1997, when Alice, his wife, passed away, and he then moved to Portland, OR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years back, Kent came to join me, working on the Senate staff. He worked for 3 months. It was an honor and a pleasure to have my longstanding friend Kent Shearer work with me in the Senate. He brought a level of legal insights and erudition which was rare for a Senate staffer. But then Kent himself might have been a Senator had his career path taken one different shift. That was in 1994, in January, when the staff was being organized on the President's Commission to investigate the assassination  of President Kennedy, commonly known as the Warren Commission. We had one spot left among the young lawyers on the staff. The Commission was recruiting lawyers from all over the country in order to avoid having the Washington establishment conduct the investigation out of concern that there might be some thought of a coverup if the same crowd in Washington did the investigation. There was concern about the integrity of Washington then</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kent was active in Utah politics, was chairman of the State committee, was instrumental in the campaigns of Senator Garn and Senator Hatch and  worked for Senator Bennett's father, also a Senator. He worked with Senator Robert Bennett, very close to the political establishment of the State of Utah, a friend to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Michael Leavitt, and would have been well suited for the U.S. Senate. Had Kent come  to the Senate, we would have had three Senators from Russell, KS, since Senator Dole's hometown is Russell, while I was born in Wichita and moved to Russell at the age of 12. Kent would have fit in this establishment very well. He would have been a credit to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 30, Steve Mills, who was also Kent's colleague for the debate tournaments, and I went to Salt Lake City to participate in Kent's funeral services. He was a great American. He had a knack for writing, contributed extensively to the newspaper in Washington on columns. He was a brilliant man, an outstanding lawyer, and a really great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have taken a few moments today to eulogize him because his record is worth noting for the permanent record in our Congressional Record, especially since he was a member of the Senate family, even though for only a 3-month period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following obituary printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
