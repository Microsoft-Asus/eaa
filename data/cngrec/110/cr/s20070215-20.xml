    <paragraph>Madam President, I am proud to rise in support of the confirmation of Norman Randy Smith to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question about Randy Smith's credentials or competence for this position. He has been a State district judge in Idaho's Sixth Judicial District for a decade. He has served as a felony drug court judge and a pro tem justice on the Idaho Supreme Court and the Idaho Court of Appeals. He has a wealth of experience in both the practice and teaching of law, and he has been an active member of the bar association and other professional associations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also no question about Judge Smith's character and fitness for this office. Randy Smith is deeply involved in his community and State, and he has held positions of leadership and responsibility in a wide variety of organizations. He is respected and well-liked by Republicans and Democrats alike throughout the State of Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a fine man--the kind of person you would want to have as a scout leader for your kids. He is a principled and knowledgeable community citizen--the kind of person you would want to have on your team or your board. He is a thoughtful, objective judge--the kind of judge you would trust to render an impartial and well-reasoned decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Men and women come to the bench by many different roads, including academia or elected public office.

His character and competence fit him to advance to this important position, and Idahoans are confident that he would be a tremendous asset to our region, and the Nation, as a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</paragraph>
