    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to wholeheartedly endorse an amendment filed today prior to the 2:30 deadline, authored by Senator Chambliss and coauthored by myself. The amendment relates to SCHIP, State Children's Health Insurance Program, and a crisis that exists right now, this minute, in 17 States in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the occupant of the chair knows, SCHIP is a program where our most needy children are able to get health insurance. It is a 71-percent Federal Medicaid match. But unlike Medicaid, it is not an entitlement; it is an appropriated amount annually that is derived by a formula as the States get their benefit. What has happened this year is that a number of States, with a number of children eligible for the program, have run out of their Federal match and it is capitated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, a number of States have a significant surplus. What Senator Chambliss has proposed, and what I am advocating, is an amendment we want to propose to the CR which would take that amount of surplus SCHIP money in States with more than 200 percent of their estimated need--take that amount above 200 percent and put it into a pool and reallocate it to those States that are falling short, so that through this fiscal year every child in America who has been promised children's health insurance  can in fact get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't penalize any State that has a surplus because that is money they have not and will not use. It doesn't benefit any State who has abused the system. It is just that we have a number of States that have grown rapidly in their numbers. In Georgia alone, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we added 43,000 children immediately into our State's population, most all of whom remain today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the CR amendment tree has been filled as of now. The distinguished majority leader has filled the tree, so there will be no room for amendments to the continuing resolution. I intend to vote tomorrow for cloture to allow us to complete this resolution and continue appropriations for this year. I hope the distinguished majority leader will think about the value of saving the SCHIP program this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter that was distributed by the majority leader and the Speaker, written to the President of the United States, on February 2.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, they made my case better than I make it in this letter. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid say we must fix the SCHIP program and suggested that the President add that to the emergency supplemental on Iraq, which we are going to take up in April.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem with that is, my State of Georgia runs out of SCHIP money at the end of this month--maybe, at the latest, at the end of March. We are having to cut off new enrollees now and will soon send out the notices to 273,000 children. There will be no money for the remainder of the year after March to meet the obligations of SCHIP. That will take place in States around the country, North, South, East and West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about it. If you have enough money here and everybody who had that money allocated has used all they need, and you don't have enough money over here, it is a simple accounting measurement to fix that in this interim time. Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus have already committed, and Senators Rockefeller and Reid--all of us on both sides have all said we have to fix the formula; we will get to it toward the end of the year. But we can fix it in the interim  to see to it that no child with health care under SCHIP loses that before we make the permanent fix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator Chambliss, who is on the floor, on his leadership and this amendment. I ask the majority leader to give close thought to this issue that was referenced in his own letter of February 2. If there was one amendment that could go on the continuing resolution and would receive unanimous support in the Congress and in the Senate, it is the amendment authored by Senator Chambliss and cosponsored by myself. I ask the leadership to seriously consider allowing an opening  on the amendment tree so that amendment can be passed and adopted, and children in Georgia and around the country will end up having the health care that they have been promised and that they deserve.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, first, I thank my dear friend from Oregon for letting us have some time here to talk about this issue that is so critical to 17 States, which my colleague so eloquently stated. I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleague from Georgia, he and I have worked on this issue so closely together, and the authorship is a combination between the two of us. He has been very generous with his time on this issue and, most importantly, very generous with the thought process he always puts into the most difficult issues we face up here. Without Senator Isakson, we would not be where we are today on this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I wish to speak to a critical piece of legislation. It is my hope that this legislation will remedy a situation currently facing hundreds of thousands of hard-working families in Georgia who depend on the State Children's Health Insurance Program--or what we know as SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Georgia, some 273,000 previously uninsured children are now receiving health insurance provided by our State's Peachcare Program. Georgia is one of several States facing a projected funding shortfall for fiscal year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Georgia Department of Community Health that runs Peachcare announced that it will stop enrolling new children into the program effective March 11, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Isakson, Congressman Nathan Deal, and I have been working relentlessly with our Governor, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Senator GRASSLEY, and the Finance and Budget Committees to find a short-term solution for the children of Georgia who are dependent upon this program. Unfortunately, to this point there has been no resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Isakson would like to introduce an amendment today to the continuing resolution that would redistribute fiscal year 2005 and 2006 funds from States that have an excess of more than 200 percent in Federal SCHIP funds to cover the shortfall for States in need for the remainder of fiscal year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has already passed legislation in an attempt to continue to cover children in States that are running out of funding for SCHIP. <bill type="h" number="6164">H.R. 6164</bill>, which became public law on January 15, 2007, required a redistribution of SCHIP funds in an attempt to delay State shortfalls until May of 2007. The estimated remaining shortfall is approximately $750 million for 14 States. According to recent estimates there is about $4 billion in unspent funds which have accumulated in other States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hard-working Georgians who qualify for this program don't need to wonder how they are going to pay for their children's health care. We must bridge the gap so that these children can continue to be insured, and I hope the Democratic leadership will allow this amendment to be considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time is running out on this funding issue for Georgia's children and children in other States. The continuing resolution is an important funding vehicle that will allow us to solve this problem for the remainder of the year until Congress can reauthorize this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Georgia's Peachcare Program is providing health insurance to the children of hardworking Americans. They are the kids of the mechanic who works on your car at the local service station, the woman who checks you out every week at the grocery store, or the teacher who is providing your children with the basic knowledge they will use throughout their life. SCHIP programs are for the men and women who make too much money to receive Medicaid yet cannot afford to provide premium insurance for their  children at the level of care that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I read in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently about Sylvia Banks, a mother of 3 from Ringgold, GA, who is a parent that is concerned the Peachcare Program will soon run out of money. Her 13-year-old son, Benjamin, wears a $7,000 insulin pump, and supplies for him are around $300 a month, paid for by Peachcare. In a recent news article, Ms. Banks, whose husband is a minister, states, "We can't do without the insurance. We are taxpayers trying our best to earn an honest living. We are not  trying to suck up the government's money. We see this as a benefit and blessing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peachcare, and other programs funded through SCHIP throughout the country, allow families to bridge the gap between Medicaid and high priced premium insurance that many families cannot afford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of this program is too vital to our country's working class not to find a solution to this problem, and find a solution soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just briefly read some excerpts from a letter written to President Bush from Majority Leader Reid and Speaker NANCY PELOSI, who have echoed our sentiments about this critical funding issue:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you consider the emergency needs of our Nation, we respectfully request that you not forget the millions of low-income Americans who are insured under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). We ask that you submit a separate spending proposal to cover shortfalls in SCHIP for fiscal year 2007 which have been estimated to be $745 million. Unless we act quickly to provide additional funds to this important program, we are putting the health coverage of thousands of Americans in  jeopardy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, over 46 million Americans are without health insurance. We can ill afford to increase the rolls of the uninsured for failure to adequately fund a successful and efficient insurance program such as SCHIP. Yet we know that at least fourteen States will face a shortfall of SCHIP funds within months. The Governor of Georgia has written to us stating that "it is vitally important to our most needy citizens that Congress act expeditiously."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The letter goes on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SCHIP has become a vital part of our safety net, providing health care coverage to millions of Americans who otherwise would  be uninsured. Including funds to address fully the looming SCHIP shortfall would assure that States can continue to provide this important coverage while we work to address the longer-term success of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, we have introduced our amendment today because Georgia's children are waiting. This is about them--our children. They are our Nation's future--and their health care needs must be met. The people in Georgia want a solution to this problem. Hard working Georgians and Americans across the U.S. don't need to wonder how they are going to pay for their children's health care. These are our middle class citizens who work to find a solution and that is what we have been doing and what we will  continue to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Democratic leadership to allow consideration of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
