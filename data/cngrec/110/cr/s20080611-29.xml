  <narrative>HONORING HONOR GROUNDS LLC -- (Senate - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5521">S5521</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I celebrate an inventive Maine small business that is helping to support our country's National Guard and Reservist families. Honor Grounds LLC distributes its own brand of high-quality coffee to convenience stores and supermarkets, and a portion of the sales go to helping some of our country's most deserving citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Honor Grounds LLC is an enormously innovative project of Dan Boudreau, who is a longtime coffee distributor, as well as Catherine and John Salterio, principals at Consolidated Services, a beverage distribution consulting firm in Minot. Several years ago, Mr. Boudreau, who is a Maine Army National Guard veteran himself, sought a unique avenue to give back to the Guard. Mr. Boudreau, together with the Salterios, developed a program to sell specially packaged Honor Grounds coffee and to donate some  of the profits to assist military families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They launched the company earlier this year and report that retailers have demonstrated immense support for the initiative. In fact, Hannaford Brothers, one of the supermarket chains participating in the program, generously waived its usual stocking fee for Honor Grounds in recognition of the program's significance. They offer three military-themed flavors of coffee--Reveille Dark, Five Star Joe, and D-Day Decaf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All donated proceeds from Honor Grounds go specifically to The Patriot Fund, which was designed to concentrate money in the hands of groups that aid America's military personnel and their families. Already, Honor Grounds has succeeded in funding several organizations nationwide, including the Maine Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as Tee It Up For The Troops, a golf fundraising nonprofit that supports the families of disabled and fallen servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Honor Grounds coffee consists of choice 100 percent roasted Arabica beans, which translates to an exceptional cup of coffee. But more notably, each bag of Honor Grounds coffee includes the story of a member of the National Guard or Reserves. Each biography details the life of one of our Nation's defenders, the heroes among us. More than just a nice touch, these narratives provide a link between soldier and civilian, which makes the purchase of Honor Grounds coffee all the more meaningful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To expand the scope of its reach, supplement its retail sales, and ultimately generate more funds for the Nation's military families, Honor Grounds recently implemented a fundraising partnership program. Schools, veterans and civic organizations, as well as other groups sell Honor Grounds coffee with their association's logo on the box, thereby promoting both the group and Honor Grounds. Notably, Honor Grounds donates an extra $1.50 to that club's home State military families for each box sold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Honor Grounds is not only a patriotic small business, but it also represents a truly creative approach to bolstering our Nation's support of those who serve. With the motto of "Helping Military Members and Their Families, One Cup at a Time," Honor Grounds is seeking to reinvigorate the gratitude our country's finest citizens have earned. I thank Mr. Boudreau and the Salterios for their selfless efforts, and wish them continued success in their magnificent achievement.</paragraph>
