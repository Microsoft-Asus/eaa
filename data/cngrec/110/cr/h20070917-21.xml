  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="497">H. Res. 497</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the protection of the human rights of minority groups is consistent with the actions of a responsible stakeholder in the international community and with the role of a host of a major international event such as the Olympic Games;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas recent actions taken against the Uyghur minority by authorities in the People's Republic of China and, specifically, by local officials in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, have included major violations of human rights and acts of cultural suppression;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the authorities of the People's Republic of China have manipulated the strategic objectives of the international war on terror to increase their cultural and religious oppression of the Muslim population residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas an official campaign to encourage Han Chinese migration into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has resulted in the Uyghur population becoming a minority in their traditional homeland and has placed immense pressure on those who are seeking to preserve the linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions of the Uyghur people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the House of Representatives has a particular interest in the fate of Uyghur human rights leader Rebiya Kadeer, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and her family as Ms. Kadeer was first arrested in August 1999 while she was en route to meet with a delegation from the Congressional Research Service and was held in prison on spurious charges until her release and exile to the United States in the spring of 2005;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas upon her release, Ms. Kadeer was warned by her Chinese jailors not to advocate for human rights in Xinjiang and throughout China while in the United States or elsewhere, and was reminded that she had several family members residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas while residing in the United States, Ms. Kadeer founded the International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy Foundation and was elected President of the Uyghur American Association and President of the World Uyghur Congress in Munich, Germany;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas two of Ms. Kadeer's sons were detained and beaten and one of her daughters was placed under house arrest in June 2006;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas President George W. Bush recognized the importance of Ms. Kadeer's human rights work in a June 5, 2007, speech in Prague, Czech Republic, when he stated: "Another dissident I will meet here is Rebiyah Kadeer of China, whose sons have been jailed in what we believe is an act of retaliation for her human rights activities. The talent of men and women like Rebiyah is the greatest resource of their nations, far more valuable than the weapons of their army or their oil under the ground.";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Kahar Abdureyim, Ms. Kadeer's eldest son, was fined $12,500 for tax evasion and another son, Alim Abdureyim, was sentenced to seven years in prison and fined $62,500 for tax evasion in a blatant attempt by local authorities to take control of the Kadeer family's remaining business assets in the People's Republic of China;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas another of Ms. Kadeer's sons, Ablikim Abdureyim, was beaten by local police to the point of requiring medical attention in June 2006 and has been subjected to continued physical abuse and torture while being held incommunicado in custody since that time;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Ablikim Abdureyim was also convicted by a kangaroo court on April 17, 2007, for "instigating and engaging in secessionist" activities and was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment, this trial being held in secrecy and Mr. Abdureyim reportedly being denied the right to legal representation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas two days later, on April 19, 2007, another court in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, sentenced Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil to life in prison for "splittism" and also for "being party to a terrorist organization" after having successfully sought his extradition from Uzbekistan where he was visiting relatives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Chinese authorities have continued to refuse to recognize Mr. Celil's Canadian citizenship, although he was naturalized in 2005, denied Canadian diplomats access to the courtroom when Mr. Celil was sentenced, and have refused to grant consular access to Mr. Celil in prison;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson publicly warned Canada "not to interfere in China's domestic affairs" after Mr. Celil's sentencing; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Celil's case was a major topic of conversation in a recent Beijing meeting between the Canadian and Chinese Foreign Ministers: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of the People's Republic of China--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) should recognize, and seek to ensure, the linguistic, cultural, and religious rights of the Uyghur people of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) should immediately release the children of Rebiya Kadeer from both incarceration and house arrest and cease harassment and intimidation of the Kadeer family members; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) should immediately release Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil and allow him to rejoin his family in Canada.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="hr" number="497">H. Res. 497</bill>.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from America Samoa?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank again my colleague from New Jersey for his participation in managing the other side of the aisle on this proposed legislation. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the gentleman from California, Mr. TOM LANTOS, for his leadership and for his support of this legislation. Especially I want to thank my good friend and colleague, the distinguished senior ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for her authorship of this human rights resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With passage of this measure, Congress will shine its spotlight on the brutal suppression of the Muslim Uyghur people by the Chinese Government, and the despicable retaliatory actions of the Chinese Government against the leading Uyghur human rights voice, Rebiya Kadeer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar to the Tibetans, the Turkic Muslim Uyghur have long sought to protect their cultural survival in the face of the Chinese Government-supported migration of the Han Chinese to the Uyghur homeland. Chinese authorities severely restrict economic and educational freedoms for the Uyghurs, regularly destroying books and closing places of worship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most trials of Uyghur prisoners are held in secret and many political prisoners are routinely executed without the knowledge of their families. Thousands of Uyghur political prisoners are held without charge or even trial and are routinely abused or tortured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the People's Republic of China continues to brutally suppress even the slightest attempts of peaceful political, religious and cultural expression of the Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Province. After the attacks in the U.S. on September 11, the People's Republic of China has used the pretext of the war on terrorism to justify these severe human rights violations in Xinjiang and routinely labels the Uyghurs as terrorists and as splitists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Uyghur people found their human rights voice in Rebiya Kadeer, the Chinese Government immediately moved against her and sentenced her to 8 years in prison. They arrested her while she was on her way to meet representatives of our Congressional Research Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After international lobbying efforts, the Chinese Government finally released her from prison. They told her that her children would pay a steep price if she continued to lobby for human rights in Xinjiang.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you carry the hopes and dreams of your entire people on your shoulders, it is impossible to be quiet in the face of such brutal oppression. Upon arriving in the United States, Rebiya continued her human rights work through the International Human Rights and Democracy Foundation and as president of the Uyghur American Association and the World Uyghur Congress in Munich, Germany.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Government held to their word and arrested her sons in Xinjiang. Her daughter was placed under house arrest. Using the pretext of a tax investigation to strip the family of all the remaining possessions and business interests, one son was fined $12,500 for tax evasion. Another was sentenced to 7 years in prison and fined $62,500. Yet another was sentenced to 9 years in prison on April 17, 2007, for secessionism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ros-Lehtinen resolution before us, Mr. Speaker, also raises the human rights of Uyghur Canadian Huseyin Celil. He was recently convicted by a Chinese court to life imprisonment on bogus charges. The Canadian Government has been denied access to him throughout his trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The blatant refusal to accept even the most basic norms of diplomatic conduct and refusing Canadian embassy officials to visit Mr. Celil not only flies in the face of long-established diplomatic norms and standards, but it is a flagrant violation of Mr. Celil's internationally recognized human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this resolution and in sending the Chinese Government a strong message that it needs to respect the minority rights of the Uyghur people, that it needs to immediately release the children of Rebiya Kadeer and cease all harassment of her family members, and set free Mr. Celil so he can return to Canada to be reunited with his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this resolution offered by Ms. Ros-Lehtinen that asks the Chinese Government to recognize the rights of the Uyghur people and to free the children of Rebiya Kadeer, an extraordinary human rights activist and Uyghur spokeswoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At turning points in history, Mr. Speaker, of oppressed peoples, one honest and courageous man or woman often comes to represent the entire people in the eyes of the world. In the United States, on matters related to civil rights, it was the Reverend Martin Luther King. In Burma, it is Aung San Suu Kyi. In India, it was Gandhi. For Chinese Catholics, it was Cardinal Kung. In Poland, it was Lech Walesa and John Paul II. For Tibetans, it is his Holiness, the Dalai Lama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the Uyghur people, deprived of their religious freedom, robbed of their cultural and linguistic rights and marginalized in their own homeland by the government-organized Han Chinese migration, it is Rebiya Kadeer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, Ms. Kadeer was a voice crying in the wilderness, asking the serial human rights abusers in Beijing to recognize the rights of the Uyghur people. In 1999, the Chinese Government imprisoned her. In 2005, it released her into exile into the United States, warning her not to advocate for her people. Her husband and several children were already in exile here. Others remained behind. In 2000, while she was in prison, one of her daughters testified at a human rights hearing that I chaired  on the Uyghurs, and she was very powerful in her statement on behalf of her mom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though some of her children still lived in China, this incredibly brave woman established a Uyghur human rights foundation. Now she has become the quintessential symbol of Uyghur aspirations and hopes. She is a recognized leader in the Uyghur exile and human rights communities, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and a friend of President Bush after their meeting in Prague this past summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all want Beijing to act like a responsible stakeholder in the world. I make no secret of my conviction that Beijing has a very long way to go. The list of serious human rights abuses committed by the Chinese Government is long. It includes the persuasive systematic exploitation of women and the murder of their children through forced abortion as part of its coercive one-child-per-couple policy. Against the Uyghurs, it is used as a means of genocide, of trying to destroy an entire  race and ethnic group of people because of their ethnicity. The imprisonment of democratic dissidents and religious believers remains a serious and pervasive problem in the PRC, as does the marginalization of the Tibetans in their homeland on the roof of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The extensive use of torture has been documented time and time again. Manfred Nowak, the Special Rapporteur for the United Nations, went to China and came back, and his report is literally an indictment. If you are arrested, if a Han Chinese, a Uyghur or anyone is arrested, the way they get a conviction is they torture you. Eventually you sign on the bottom line and you admit your so-called crimes. They have also forcibly repatriated North Korean refugees. Again, there is abuse after abuse after  abuse, and the Uyghurs are at the brunt of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The oppression of the Uyghurs in their homeland along the Silk Road must be included, Mr. Speaker, on any list of Chinese Government's most serious abuses. In the United States, Ms. Kadeer has ensured that the world does not forget the oppression of the Uyghur  people, and the Chinese Government has retaliated now, as they have in the past, by harassing her children who live in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by placing them under house arrest,  by incarcerating them and by beating them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives, both Republicans and Democrats alike, ask that Beijing end this campaign of retaliation against the Kadeer family. We join the voice of those who care for those kids, an anguished mother who cries, "let my children go."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We also ask that Beijing immediately release Hussein Celil, an ethnic Uyghur who is a citizen of Canada, so he can rejoin his family living in that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in the darkness of the political oppression of the Uyghur people, Rebiya Kadeer stands out as a beacon of light and hope. Let us honor her and her family and her work by enthusiastically supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and thank my good friend from New Jersey. I call him the champion of human rights all over the world. Wherever there is violation of human rights, he is there; and I commend him for his efforts all these years that I have been privileged to work closely with him on these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recall years ago Mr. Mandela was accused by a former Prime Minister of Great Britain as being a terrorist. Of course, having served in prison for 29 years, all he was trying to say was that something was wrong in South Africa. They call it apartheid. If that isn't a human rights violation, I don't know what is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fact that these two people, the lady and her children and this Canadian citizen, whether it is 2 or 3 or 3 million, our government and this Congress should give every attention as far as to the needs of those people as far as human rights violations are concerned.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="497">H. Res. 497</bill>, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of the People's Republic of China should immediately release from custody the children of Rebiya Kadeer and Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil and should refrain from further engaging in acts of cultural, linguistic, and religious suppression directed against the Uyghur people, and for other purposes. I want to congratulate my good friend and  colleague, the distinguished ranking member of this Committee, Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN, for this important human rights resolution. It is the responsibility of the Congress to remind the government of the People's Republic of China of their obligations to live up to international standards to protect ethnic cultural identities and minority rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, not only does the People's Republic of China systemically abuse the basic human rights of its minority citizens, but its repressive tactics extend to the members of politically active human rights advocates' families. Furthermore, the government has manipulated the international war on terrorism to justify its repressive treatment of the Muslim population living in Xinjiang, as well as encouraging Chinese migration into the region in an attempt to purify the region of its traditional  Uyghur occupants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is extremely important that the United States hold the government of the People's Republic of China responsible to international standards regarding political as well as basic human rights. The government brutally suppresses even the slightest attempts of peaceful political, religious, and cultural expression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. As a member of Congress, I feel particularly responsible to Uyghur human rights activist Rebiya Kadeer, who was arrested while she was on her way to meet representatives  of our Congressional Research Service. While she was released from prison following international lobbying efforts, deemed a prisoner of consciousness by Amnesty International, upon resumption of her human rights advocacy abroad, her sons in Xinjiang were arrested and remain imprisoned to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution also raises the human rights issues of Huseyin Cecil, a Uyghur Canadian who was recently convicted in a kangaroo court to life imprisonment on "bogus" charges. The Canadian government and Embassy Officials have been refused access to their citizen throughout the process, and the Chinese government has blatantly refused to accept even the most basic norms of diplomatic conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By supporting this resolution, the United States will alert the Chinese government that it must respect the minority rights of the Uyghur people as well as the rights of human rights advocates. The resolution requires the immediate release of the children of Rebiya Kadeer as well as Mr. Cecil so that they might all return to their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution.</paragraph>
