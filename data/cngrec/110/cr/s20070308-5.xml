    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour, with the time divided between both sides, the Republicans having the first half and the majority the second half. Following that period of time, the Senate will resume consideration of the 9/11 legislation, <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, the Republican leader and I had a discussion about the legislation, the importance of completing it and how we do so. The Republican leader modified a pending amendment in order to include the provisions of three other amendments which were pending, and then filed cloture on that amendment. Before adjourning last night, I filed cloture on both the substitute amendment and the bill. So tomorrow morning, Friday, we will have a cloture vote on the Republican amendment. And, of course,  if cloture is not invoked, then there is an immediate cloture vote on the substitute. So Members could be here Friday well beyond the noon hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to remind Members, since cloture has been filed on the substitute and the bill, they have until 1 p.m. today to file any additional germane first-degree amendments. At this point, approximately 110 amendments have already been filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, 40 amendments are currently pending. That includes, of course, the substitute amendment. I am advised that from a preliminary review by the Parliamentarians of these pending amendments, only eight of them are germane. I have the list of amendments here. It is a long list, as we indicated, of some 100-plus amendments. Out of those, there are eight that are germane. There may be a couple more that are arguably germane. But that is where we are. We will instruct the two managers to see  if they, today, can move through the germane amendments. That would speed things up postcloture tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are still attempting to resolve other issues on this most important bill. It is a bill that deals, as we know, with the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. It has been 2 1/2  years since they completed their work. The House has already done theirs. We are going to do our very best to follow suit. I feel  comfortable we will be able to complete something before we leave here this Friday or Saturday or, if good fortune smiles on us, we can work out  something tonight.</paragraph>
