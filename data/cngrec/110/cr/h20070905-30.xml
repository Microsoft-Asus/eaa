  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of United States security interests in Asia and the Pacific and is fundamental to regional stability and prosperity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States-Japan alliance continues to be based on shared vital interests and values in the Asia-Pacific region, despite the changes in the post-cold war strategic landscape, including the preservation and promotion of political and economic freedoms, support for human rights and democratic institutions, and securing of prosperity for the people of both countries and the international community;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on April 27, 2007, during Prime Minister Abe's visit to Washington, President Bush and the Prime Minister reconfirmed their commitment to these common strategic objectives;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Japan provides military bases and generous financial and material support to United States forward-deployed forces, which are essential for maintaining stability in the region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas under the United States-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, Japan hosts a carrier battle group, the III Marine Expeditionary Force, and the 5th Air Force;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States currently maintains approximately 50,000 troops in Japan, about half of whom are stationed in Okinawa;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas over the past decade the alliance has been strengthened through revised Defense Guidelines (which expand Japan's noncombat role in a regional contingency) and the continued renewal of Japan's Host Nation Support of United States forces stationed in Japan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 2005, the two allies agreed on a redefinition of roles, missions, and capabilities of alliance forces, which further deepens interoperability and coordination between the Japanese Self Defense Forces (SDF) and United States Armed Forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the agreement also provided for reducing the number of troops stationed in Okinawa and broadening our cooperation in the area of ballistic missile defense (BMD);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in May 2007, the United States and Japan confirmed that, as both countries develop and deploy capabilities, every effort must be made to ensure tactical, operational, and strategic coordination, including ballistic missile threats against alliance interests;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Japan has participated significantly in international efforts to combat terrorism by providing major logistical support for United States and coalition forces in the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Japan has also provided troops, aircraft, and logistical support for Operation Iraqi Freedom, a commitment which the Japanese Government recently renewed: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes that Japan is one of the most reliable security partners of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) commends the Government of Japan for its role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific Region; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) expresses appreciation to the Government of Japan for its contributions to international efforts to combat terrorism.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from American Samoa?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this proposed bill and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to express my appreciation to the leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the distinguished chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), and our distinguished ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen from Florida, for their support of this proposed bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me also thank our distinguished colleague from the great State of New Jersey, a senior member of the Armed Services Committee as well as the Natural Resources Committee, my good friend, Mr. Saxton, for his sponsorship of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When World War II came to a close, the relationship between the United States and Japan could not have been worse. Both sides sustained heavy human losses at the hands of the other's military, but together, starting in the late 1940s, the United States and the Japanese people rebuilt a war-torn Japanese nation brick by brick, industry by industry. The alliance between the United States and Japan has grown steadily since then, and now it could hardly be stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Japan today is one of our closest allies in the Asia-Pacific region. The strong and enduring partnership we developed when that war thankfully came to an end bridges economic, military and political realms. Our military alliance helped prevent another world conflict during the Cold War, and our two nations jointly held fast to the  ideas of democracy and freedom in the face of the menacing communist threat in this Asian region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the U.S. military security alliance with Japan is not only just the backbone of the relationship between our two great nations, but it is the bedrock of peace and security throughout the Asia-Pacific region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon this foundation, we continue to work together to advance our shared values. We jointly promote open markets, open societies, and open and transparent governments in Asia and around the world. Japan's economic success is a beacon and an example to the entire planet, now being the second most powerful economy in the whole world. We also tackle some of the most difficult challenges of our time, working together in the crucial Six-Party Talks to denuclearize North Korea and stabilize Northeast  Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Japan is a reliable and generous friend, quick to assist the United States in our times of need. Japan has provided important logistical support for the current war in Iraq and is on the front lines of the international efforts to combat terrorism by providing support to operations in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As strong as our relationship is now, we look forward to an even stronger partnership in the future. Our two countries are brought together by shared interests and shared values, and we are bound together by mutual respect and friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution celebrates this friendship by recognizing the strong security alliance between Japan and the United States, as well as Japan's critical role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the House reaffirms that we value highly our alliance with the great nation of Japan and believe this partnership will continue indefinitely into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and urge my colleagues to support it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to first rise in support of House Resolution 508, introduced by my good friend, Mr. Saxton of New Jersey, and I would like to congratulate him for offering this resolution before us today because the United States security objectives in the Asia-Pacific region could not be achieved without the staunch support of our friends and allies in Tokyo. The United States-Japan alliance is, as this resolution recognizes, the cornerstone of regional stability and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Pyongyang tested a nuclear weapon last fall, we relied heavily on our good friend, Japan, which was then serving as president of the U.N. Security Council. Together, we achieved passage of Security Council Resolution 1718 condemning North Korea's reckless action and imposing a series of sanctions. We must continue to work with Tokyo to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis in order to ensure regional peace and stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Japan has also been an irreplaceable partner in support of our efforts to fight global terrorism. Also, in the year 2002, Tokyo graciously offered to host the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan following the ouster of the Taliban regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also very grateful to Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces for continuing to provide logistical support in the Indian Ocean to coalition efforts waging the international war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, the Japanese Diet approved a 2-year extension of the Special Measures Law in Iraq which provides continued funding for the reconstruction of a peaceful and stable Iraq. It was also recently reported that three Japanese banks have stopped engaging in any new business with Iran, and that Japanese financial institutions are restricting loans and rejecting an Iranian request to pay for oil imports in currencies other than dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are proud of the U.S.-Japan alliance and deeply grateful for the friendship of the people of Japan. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, Madam Speaker, which is of vital importance to the security of both the United States and Japan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the author of this resolution, Mr. Saxton of New Jersey.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400359" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank the gentlelady for yielding. And let me begin by thanking my good friend and colleague, Chairman TOM LANTOS, for the great high level of cooperation that was exhibited on this resolution on a bipartisan basis with Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and others. And also, let me acknowledge the great support of my friend, Mr. Faleomavaega, on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 508, obviously, which recognizes the strong security alliance between Japan and the United States and expresses appreciation for Japan's role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region in combating terrorism, and specifically in Japan's very significant contribution toward global missile defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to highlight our special relationship with Japan following World War II. Our alliance has served as a valuable conduit allowing the United States to achieve our security goals throughout East Asia. This dynamic nation is the world's second largest economy, one of our top trading partners, provides 600,000 U.S. jobs, and is actively engaged with many other democracies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our two countries have encountered similar challenges and fought shared threats while working to guarantee political and economic freedoms for our citizens and for many others. This goal of spreading democracy-based prosperity became particularly evident following the events of September 11. Following these deplorable acts, Japan readily provided support for U.S. and allied forces. Their effort included invaluable maritime operations in the Indian Ocean, aircraft to conduct support missions for  our troops in Iraq, and logistical support that even continues to this very day. These actions reveal Japan's dedication to eradicating the destruction caused by sponsors of terrorism. Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces have provided roughly 30 percent of the fuel used by U.S. and coalition</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud them for recognizing that the international threats of terror will require the cooperation of the world's strongest democracies to effectively combat the growing capabilities and support systems of terrorist organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our strategic relationship extends beyond Japan's involvement in the Middle East. Japan offers financial and material resources to the U.S.-deployed forces, 50,000 of which are stationed in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, our two countries agreed to redefine and strengthen the missions of both of our military forces. My resolution mentions examples of this coordination by reducing the number of troops in Okinawa and expanding the cooperation of ballistic missile defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I want to reiterate my thanks to Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN for their assistance in bringing this to the floor today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from American Samoa has 16 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to have as much time as I may consume to again compliment and to commend my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, for his insight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And certainly as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, no one knows better the importance of our strategic and military influence in this important region of the world, and especially with an alliance and a partnership with the great country of Japan, that they have always stood beside us and always been there when we needed assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, I want to commend my good friend from New Jersey for his comments and sponsorship of this legislation. And I thank my good friend,  the gentlelady from Florida, the ranking member, for helping us manage this legislation and get it approved by our colleagues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="508">H. Res. 508</bill>, which recognizes the strong security alliance between the Government of Japan and the United States and expresses our country's appreciation to Japan for its role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region and also for their efforts in the global war on terrorism. I commend Mr. Saxton for authoring this resolution and for the support by the leadership to bring this resolution up for our consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 29, 2005, the Government of the United States and the Government of Japan entered into a renewed Security Consultative Agreement that calls for a major realignment of U.S.-Japan strategic alliance. This agreement continues Japan's strategic role for the security of the region in cooperation with the United States. In addition, the agreement will realign our U.S. forces within Japan and throughout the Pacific so that the U.S. is better positioned to respond militarily to incidents in  Asia and the Pacific.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incidentally, under the agreement, the U.S. territory of Guam could become the new home to elements of the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force. It is projected that nearly 8,000 active duty Marines and their dependents will be relocated from Okinawa to Guam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Madam Speaker, our U.S. territories fall under the jurisdiction of the House Natural Resources Committee, specifically under the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs. As chairman of the Subcommittee, I had the unique opportunity to travel to Japan and to the Pacific over the August recess to convene a field hearing on Guam on the proposed U.S. military buildup and the challenges the island's community will face due to the impact of relocating so many U.S. forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was impressed by briefings we held with U.S. Navy ADM William French and U.S. Air Force BG Douglas Owens. Both were extremely forthright about the strategic value of Guam in defending our Nation and developing relationships and training opportunities with our allies, including Japan, so that our interests in the Asia-Pacific region are secured. In fact, while in Guam, our military was conducting "Operation Valiant Shield" which was a military exercise between our forces and those of our allies  in the Pacific and Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was equally impressed with the patriotism of the people of Guam and the support they have shown for the relocation. This is not to say that there are no concerns throughout the community on what the impact of Marines will mean to the services provided to the Government of Guam. Any community would have concerns on education, healthcare, law enforcement, infrastructure, etc. It is my hope that as the buildup continues, the Congress will consider these impacts on the island community and work  to mitigate such problems for the benefit of the community "outside the gates."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On my return from Guam, I also had the opportunity to meet with officials from the Japanese Defense and Foreign Ministries to be briefed on their progress in the realignment of U.S. Forces in Japan. In addition to meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Haneda, we were informed by the Senior Coordinator for Japan-U.S. Security Affairs, Keiichi Ono and the Deputy Director General for Realignment Initiatives Daikichi Momma and their team, that Japan is moving forward with the things they need to do  to fully implement the realignment and that they would be mindful to take into account concerns raised about the impact of the realignment on the territory and people of Guam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to express my appreciation and that of my constituents to the people of Japan for their continued strong alliance and for their role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region and their efforts in the global war on terrorism. I urge my colleagues to support adoption of <bill type="hr" number="508">H. Res. 508</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the House Resolution 508, recognizing the strong security alliance between the Government of Japan and the United States and expressing appreciation to Japan for its role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and its efforts in the global war against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government of Japan, crucial to stabilizing the Asia-Pacific Region, has for decades served as a cornerstone for U.S. national security posture worldwide. I expect our governments to remain strong allies long into the future. The Government of Japan's efforts in support of the global war against terrorism are commendable and serve as a superb model for other governments to emulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Guam, who I represent in Congress, enjoy a robust relationship with the Japanese people. Many residents on Guam are of Japanese descent. Also, Guam hosts over a million Japanese tourists each year and we welcome more. Japanese companies make significant investments in Guam's telecommunications infrastructure and in our tourism and hospitality industry. Moreover, Guam's relationship with the Japanese people and their government will grow stronger in the years to come. The Government  of Japan will, in large part, finance the planned re-Iocation of elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam. What is more, the future military training exercises on and in the waters around Guam will include greater numbers of Japanese Self-Defense Force personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I welcome all efforts that strengthen the security relationship that exists between the United States and the Japan. I strongly support this resolution recognizing the valuable security alliance between the Government of Japan and the United States and expressing appreciation to Japan for its role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and its efforts in the global war against terrorism. I urge my colleagues' support.</paragraph>
