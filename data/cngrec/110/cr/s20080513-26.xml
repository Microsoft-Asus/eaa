  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 11-15, the residents of Valley City will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded by the Northern Pacific Rail Road in 1872, this community went through an assortment of names before settling on Valley City. After being known as Second Crossing, Fifth Siding, Wahpeton, and Worthington, Valley City was chosen to describe this beautiful town located in the Sheyenne River Valley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the community was developed around the winding Sheyenne River, its eight historic bridges have become an integral part of Valley City's rich history. This "City of Bridges" offers many one of a kind and original bridge designs, including the Valley City State University suspension footbridge and the concrete arched Rainbow Bridge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Valley City has a lot to offer its residents and visitors alike. With its antiques, crafts and collectables Valley City offers a distinctive shopping experience. Some of its hidden treasures include a visitor's center, the Barnes County Museum, and the Sheyenne River Valley National Scenic Byway. The scenic byway stretches 63 picturesque miles along the Sheyenne River, following ancient Native American foot paths. The area has become a magnet for hunters, fisherman, and outdoor enthusiasts of  all kinds. It is also the proud hometown of our Congressman, EARL POMEROY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Valley City is the ideal location for its residents to grow and prosper together. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the city will hold a rubber duck race, a street dance, a craft fair, a parade and fireworks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Valley City, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. It is places such as Valley City, North Dakota that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Valley City has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
