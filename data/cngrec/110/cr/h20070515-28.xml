    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have had the right to be disappointed in the President's abject refusal to do anything to give us auto efficiency and clean autos for years. And now we still have the right to be disappointed even though he has been ordered to do so by the United States Supreme Court. We sort of heard this sort of semi "maybe I'll think about it" approach the other day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need some bold action when it comes to new technology, including in our automobile sector; and we know we can get that. We know we can have efficient automobiles, and we know we can deal with global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've got to tell you, I just cannot understand why some folks here want to embrace ignorance on global warming. They point out that we didn't know about global warming in 1970. We didn't know about the Internet either, but I don't know why you shouldn't use it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've learned some things from 1970. We've learned that the planet is warming. We've learned that CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 is responsible. We've learned that it's coming from our industries. And we've learned that if we have the Federal law followed, we will have energy efficiency and a clean energy economy in the future of this country. &lt;p/&gt;END&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</paragraph>
