  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="Introducing S. 3606. A bill to extend the special immigrant nonminister religious worker program and for other purposes, considered and passed.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3606">S. 3606</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Special Immigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Program Act, <bill type="s" number="3606">S. 3606</bill>, which would extend the Special Immigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program until March 6, 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program provides for up to 5,000 special Immigrant visas per year which religious denominations or organizations in the United States can use to sponsor foreign nationals to perform religious service in our country. Since its initial enactment in 1990, the Special Immigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program has been extended four times. Yet some seem quick to discount the importance of the program. I point out that the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives  did not include language to extend the Special Immigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the important tasks nonminister religious workers perform are: providing human services to the most needy, including shelter and nutrition; caring for and ministering to the sick, aged, and dying; working with adolescents and young adults; assisting religious leaders as they lead their congregations and communities in worship; counseling those who have suffered severe trauma and/or hardship; supporting families, particularly when they are in crisis; offering religious instruction, especially  to new members of the religious denomination; and, helping refugees and immigrants in the United States adjust to a new way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that this program is not abused by fraud or other measures, the proposed legislation requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue final regulations to eliminate or reduce fraud in the program before it goes into  effect. Additionally, the legislation requires the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of the aforementioned regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that there are several religious organizations that support passage of my legislation, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the American Jewish Committee, the Agudath Israel of America, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., the Church Communities International, the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the Mennonite Central Committee, the United States National Association of Evangelicals,  the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahai of the United States, The Church of Scientology International, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston, MA, the United Methodist Church, the General Board of Church and Society, the World Relief, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that our country's religious organizations face sometimes insurmountable obstacles in using traditional employment immigration categories to fit their unique situations. Fortunately, the Non-Minister Religious Worker Visa Program allows our country's religious denominations to continue uninterrupted in their call to serve and provide support to those who are in the greatest need. I commend their service and hope they know how much I respect their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300018" topic="Introducing S. 3608. A bill to establish a Salmon Stronghold Partnership program to protect wild Pacific salmon and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3608">S. 3608</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pacific Salmon Stronghold Conservation Act of 2008, together with my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski. I am grateful for all the input and collaboration from key stakeholders in Washington State that I have received on this legislation. I am especially grateful for the input from the Quinault Tribe, the Wild Salmon Center, and Bill Ruckelshaus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While current Federal salmon recovery efforts are focused on recovering salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act, ESA, seeking to "restore what we've lost," the Salmon Stronghold Act seeks to "protect what we have." To this end, I have consistently fought for increased funding for the Pacific Coast Salmon Recovery Fund and will continue to proudly do so. In addition, with this legislation we will direct new Federal resources on protection of healthy salmon population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Restoring threatened and endangered salmon in the Pacific Northwest is an imperative. Wild Pacific salmon are central to the culture, economy, and environment of western North America. The Pacific Coast Salmon Recovery Fund, since its inception in 2000, has allowed my home State of Washington to focus the efforts of counties and conservation districts, on average, to remove 300 barriers to fish passage and to open 300 miles of habitat each year. That is 2,400 barriers removed and 2,400 miles  of habitat restored. In 2007, for every Federal dollar spent on this program it leveraged about $2 in local and State dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue the fight to protect this salmon recovery funding. But more must be done. This legislation will complement ongoing recovery efforts to ensure the future viability of healthy wild Pacific salmon runs by establishing a Federal program supporting voluntary public-private incentive-based efforts to proactively maintain the rivers that are home to the thriving populations of Pacific salmon--known as our "Salmon Strongholds."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does that by establishing a new regional Salmon Stronghold Partnership program that provides Federal support and resources to protect a network of the healthiest remaining wild Pacific salmon ecosystems in North America. The bill promotes enhanced coordination and cooperation of Federal, tribal, State and local governments, public and private land managers, fisheries managers, power authorities, and nongovernmental organizations in efforts to protect salmon strongholds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to increase funding to recovery efforts, but also focus on prevention. It is time to adopt the kind of comprehensive solution that can solidify wild Pacific salmon's place in American culture for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="Introducing S. 3612. A bill to protect citizens and legal residents of the United States from unreasonable searches and seizures of electronic equipment at the border, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3612">S. 3612</bill>] Today, I am joined by the junior Senator from Washington, Senator CANTWELL, in introducing the Travelers' Privacy Protection Act of 2008. This bill restores privacy for law-abiding Americans who, under current administration policy, may be required to give customs agents unfettered access to the contents of their laptop computers and other electronic devices when they return from overseas travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a compelling and immediate need for this legislation. Over the last two years, reports have surfaced that customs agents have been requiring American citizens and others lawfully residing in the U.S. to turn over their cell phones or give them the passwords to their laptops. The travelers have been forced to wait for hours while customs agents reviewed and sometimes copied the contents of the electronic devices. In some cases, the laptops or cell phones were confiscated, and returned  weeks or even months later, with no explanation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the practice was challenged in court, the administration argued that it can search the contents of American travelers' laptops without any suspicion of wrongdoing whatsoever, because a laptop is no different than any other "closed container." In other words, according to this administration, there is no difference between rifling through the contents of your suitcase, and logging on to your laptop, opening your files, and reviewing your photographs, medical records, financial records,  e-mails, letters, journals, work product, or an electronic record of all the Web sites you have visited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am willing to bet that most Americans would disagree. Americans understand the importance of security at the borders, and the vast majority of them accept that the government is entitled to look through their suitcases when they are returning from an overseas trip. But I say to my colleagues: try asking your constituents whether the government has a right to open their laptops, read their documents and e-mails, look at their photographs, and examine the Web sites they have visited--all without  any suspicion of wrongdoing--and see what they say. I think you'll hear the same thing that I have heard: "Not in the United States of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June of this year, I held a hearing of the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee to examine this issue. At this hearing, we learned about the effect of suspicionless electronic border searches on American businesses. The Executive Director for the Association of Corporate Travel Executives testified that, in a survey of ACTE members, 7 out of 100 respondents had experienced seizures of their laptops or other electronic equipment. Many companies are now taking expensive and burdensome  measures to protect their electronic information from forced disclosure at the border. The administration's intrusive border practices thus come with a hefty price tag for the American business sector, at a time when the economy can ill afford it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also heard disturbing evidence suggesting that Muslim Americans and Americans of Arab or South Asian descent are being targeted for these invasive searches. Many travelers from these backgrounds who have been subject to electronic searches have also been asked about their religious and political views, including why they chose to convert to Islam, what they think about Jews, and their views of the candidates in the upcoming election. This questioning is deeply disturbing in its own right.  It also strongly suggests that some border searches are being based, at least in part, on impermissible factors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time it was claiming the right to look at all of the information Americans carry with them across the border, the administration was refusing to provide Americans or Congress with information about its policies for border searches. Requests by the public and members of Congress were steadfastly ignored. DHS declined my invitation to send a witness to the hearing, claiming that its preferred witness was unavailable on that day. But after the hearing sparked a flurry of press coverage  and major newspapers criticized DHS for its secrecy, the agency made public a written policy for border searches dated July 16, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DHS policy is truly alarming in the sweeping authority it claims. According to the policy, customs agents may "analyze and review" the information in Americans' laptops and other electronic devices "absent individualized suspicion." As part of this search authority, customs agents may "detain" the electronic device for an unspecified period of time, take it off-site, make copies of its contents, and send the equipment or the copies to other agencies or even private individuals in some  cases. Although the policy purports to require probable cause to "seize" a laptop, as opposed to merely searching it, this safeguard is almost meaningless given that DHS's definition of "search" includes the right to "detain" the laptop indefinitely. Moreover the policy exempts officers' written notes from any constraints, allowing customs agents to transcribe an electronic document verbatim and keep it forever without any level of suspicion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Defenders of this policy outside the administration are hard to find. Major newspapers across the country, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and a host of other national and local outlets, have published editorials  condemning the policy and urging Congress to act. As USA Today put it: "[T]he notion that the government can arbitrarily have a free crack at your e-mail, Web searches and other personal electronic data is chilling. Given the government's abysmal record of safeguarding private data, it's no wonder that business and civil liberties groups are protesting." In my home state of Wisconsin, the Green Bay Press-Gazette put it this way: "[T]he fact that this policy exists ..... is an affront to the  core values of the United States of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fact of this public outcry, DHS has reacted like a traffic officer standing by a 20-car pile-up and telling onlookers "Nothing to see here--move along." The agency claims that its July 16 policy spells out the practice followed by customs agents for years and across administration. But that just isn't true. The Customs Directive that governed border searches of documents through the end of the Clinton Administration stated that Customs agents could glance at documents--but not read them--"to  see if they appear to be merchandise." At that point, "reasonable suspicion [was] required for read and continued detention" of the documents. The reading of personal correspondence other than merchandise was expressly prohibited. This administration's policy authorizing "review and analysis" of any and all electronic documents without a shred of suspicion thus represents a 180 degree turnaround from previous policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS alternatively defends its policy by arguing that the authority to conduct suspicionless searches of Americans' laptops is necessary to capture terrorists and criminals. Yet the few specific examples DHS has seen fit to give have all been cases in which the search was anything but suspicionless. For example, in one instance DHS has cited, the laptop search took place after customs agents received a tip that the traveler was a smuggler and discovered $79,000 in unlawful U.S. currency in his  belongings. Despite many opportunities to do so, DHS has yet to identify a single example in which a search that was conducted "absent individualized suspicion" resulted in the apprehension of a dangerous criminal or terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This brings me to my next point. Both Secretary Chertoff and the Deputy Commissioner for Customs and Border Protection have tried to downplay the extent of privacy violations by pointing out that DHS has limited resources for conducting electronic searches at the border. That may be true, but it hardly justifies suspicionless searches. To the contrary, the limited nature of these resources makes it all the more important to direct them toward people who actually do present some objective basis  for suspicion. As the DHS examples confirm, these are the cases in which electronic searches are most likely to yield results. Using our limited resources to search the laptops of law-abiding Americans who present no basis for suspicion is frankly irresponsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not simply a matter of what the Constitution protects or allows. In fact, a few lower courts have agreed with the administration that the Fourth Amendment does not protect Americans against suspicionless searches of their laptops at the border. I happen to believe that these decisions incorrectly applied Supreme Court precedent, but ultimately, that is beside the point. Not everything that comports with the Constitution is sound policy. A government practice can satisfy minimum constitutional  requirements and still violate Americans' expectations for what they want and deserve from their government. In those cases, it is up to Congress to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill I am introducing today would require DHS agents to have reasonable suspicion before searching the contents of laptops or other electronic equipment carried by U.S. citizens or other lawful residents of the U.S. "Reasonable suspicion" is a lower standard than "probable cause"; it simply requires DHS to have an objective basis for suspecting that a particular person is engaged in illegal behavior. No less should be required when the government seeks to encroach on such a significant  privacy interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the current DHS policy, the bill I am introducing requires probable cause in order for DHS agents to seize electronic equipment lent. Unlike the current policy, however, the bill defines "seize" in a manner than is consistent with both legal precedent and common sense. If DHS keeps your laptop or any of its contents for longer than 24 hours, there has clearly been a seizure, and the bill recognizes this. The bill also reinforces the probable cause requirement by requiring DHS to obtain  a warrant, while allowing DHS to hold on to the equipment pending a ruling on the warrant application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of the information DHS will review, even under a reasonable suspicion standard, will prove innocuous. Recognizing this, the bill contains provisions to protect law-abiding Americans' privacy by strictly limiting disclosure of information that DHS acquires through electronic border searches. The only disclosures that are permitted in the absence of warrant or court order are limited disclosures to other federal, state, or local government agencies. Those agencies in turn may apply for a warrant--or,  if the laptop appears to contain foreign intelligence information, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Order--to seize the equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If DHS damages the electronic equipment in the course of a search, the  agency must compensate the owner for any resulting economic loss. The bill requires DHS to establish an administrative claims process to that end. Awards will be paid from agency funds, ensuring that the bill is deficit-neutral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill prohibits profiling based on race, ethnic, religion, or national origin. Profiling based on these characteristics has no place in our society. It is repugnant to our values as a pluralistic nation, and it is counterproductive as a matter of law enforcement. At the hearing I held on this issue, all of the witnesses, those invited by myself and those invited by Senator Brownback, agreed at that point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill contains provisions to ensure that DHS provides the information about its policies and practices that Congress needs and that the public is entitled to have. The agency must provide Congress and the public with any past, existing, or future policies relating to electronic border searches, as well as information about the implementation of those policies. Our ability to know what DHS claims the right to do at the border should never depend on whether DHS chooses to send a witness  to a congressional hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taken together, these provisions reverse this administration's departure from previous policy and, more importantly, bring the government's practices at the border back in line with the reasonable expectations of law-abiding Americans. Furthermore, they enhance the security of our borders by focusing the government's resources where they can do the most good. And they will enable all of us in this body to look our constituents in the eyes and say, "You're right--that doesn't happen in the United  States of America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues give this bill the enthusiastic support it deserves. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Travelers' Privacy Protection Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Law-abiding citizens and legal residents of the United States, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin, have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their laptops, cell phones, personal handheld devices, and other electronic equipment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The Department of Homeland Security has taken the position that laptops and other electronic devices should not be treated any differently from suitcases or other "closed containers" and may be inspected by customs or immigration agents at the border or in international airports without suspicion of wrongdoing.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The Department of Homeland Security published a policy on July 16, 2008, allowing customs and immigration agents at the border and in international airports to "detain" electronic equipment and "review and analyze" the contents of electronic equipment "absent individualized suspicion". The policy applies to any person entering the United States, including citizens and other legal residents of the United States returning from overseas travel.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The privacy interest in the contents of a laptop computer differs in kind and in amount from the privacy interest in other "closed containers" for many reasons, including the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) Unlike any other "closed container" that can be transported across the border, laptops and similar electronic devices can contain the equivalent of a full library of information about a person, including medical records, financial records, e-mails and other personal and business correspondence, journals, and privileged work product.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) Most people do not know, and cannot control, all of the information contained on their laptops, such as records of websites previously visited and deleted files.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) Electronic search tools render searches of electronic equipment more invasive than searches of physical locations or objects.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Requiring citizens and other legal residents of the United States to submit to a government review and analysis of thousands of pages of their most personal information without any suspicion of wrongdoing is incompatible with the values of liberty and personal freedom on which the United States was founded.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Searching the electronic equipment of persons for whom no individualized suspicion exists is an inefficient and ineffective use of limited law enforcement resources.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Some citizens and legal residents of the United States who have been subjected to electronic border searches have reported being asked inappropriate questions about their religious practices, political beliefs, or national allegiance, indicating that the search may have been premised in part on perceptions about their race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Targeting citizens and legal residents of the United States for electronic border searches based on race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin is wholly ineffective as a matter of law enforcement and repugnant to the values and constitutional principles of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

Yet spite this enormous investment, today's chronically ill only receive just over half, 56 percent, of the preventive and maintenance services that they need. Our Nation clearly needs to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent Medicare demonstrations have shown that a number of key improvements could go a long way to help fix this situation: First, primary care physicians and key health professionals must assume more responsibility for care coordination; second, we need to target efforts at beneficiaries with multiple conditions; third, after-hours care needs to be available so people can access medical help when they need it and avoid calling 911; and finally, there must be better use of health information  technology to help manage care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The optimal way to address the challenges of caring for persons with chronic conditions is to better integrate their care. Medical problems are best managed and coordinated by health care professionals who know their patients, their problems, their medications, and their other health care providers. Using this approach, the IAH provides a better, more cost-effective way for Medicare patients with chronic conditions to get the care they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do all these things in the legislation I am introducing along with colleagues in the Senate and House: Our bill would put in place a demonstration that improves at-home care availability for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions to help people remain independent in their homes. Physicians would get paid better for managing care while at the same time they would be responsible for demonstrating at least 5 percent savings in the cost of their patients' care. The bill also includes minimum  performance standards for patient health outcomes, and would measure patient, caregiver and provider satisfaction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Independence at Home Act establishes a three-year Medicare demonstration project that uses a patient-centered health care delivery model to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions can remain independent for as long as possible in a comfortable environment; advances Medicare reform by creating incentives for providers to develop better and lower cost health care for the highest cost beneficiaries; incorporates lessons from past Medicare demonstration projects; provides  for physician and nurse practitioner-directed programs that hold providers accountable for quality, patient satisfaction, and mandatory annual minimum savings; and generates savings by providing better care to Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and reducing duplicative and unnecessary services, hospitalization, and other health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The demonstration program will take place in the thirteen highest-cost states plus thirteen additional states. Persons eligible for the program include Medicare beneficiaries with functional impairments, two or more chronic health problems, and recent use of other health services. Each IAH patient will receive a comprehensive assessment at least annually. The assessment will inform a plan for care that is directed by an IAH physician or nurse-practitioner and developed in collaboration with the  patient. Each patient will also have an IAH plan coordinator. Electronic medical records and health information technology will be employed to improve patient care. The IAH organization will be required to demonstrate savings of at least 5 percent annually</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my cosponsors in the House, Representatives Ed Markey, Chris Smith and Rahm Emanuel for their support, along with my fellow Senate cosponsors, Senators Barbara Mikulski, Benjamin Cardin and Sheldon Whitehouse. I would also like to thank all our staff who worked so hard on this legislation, particularly Gregory Hinrichsen in my office.

  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Independence at Home Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) According to the November 2007 Congressional Budget Office Long Term Outlook for Health Care Spending, unless changes are made to the way health care is delivered, growing demand for resources caused by rising health care costs and to a lesser extent the nation's expanding elderly population will confront Americans with increasingly difficult choices between health care and other priorities. However, opportunities exist to constrain health care costs without adverse health care consequences.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions account for a disproportionate share of Medicare spending compared to their representation in the overall Medicare population, and evidence suggests that such patients often receive poorly coordinated care, including conflicting information from health providers and different diagnoses of the same symptoms. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) People with chronic conditions account for 76 percent of all hospital admissions, 88 percent of all prescriptions filled, and 72 percent of physician visits.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) More than 60 percent of physicians treating patients with chronic conditions believe that their training did not adequately prepare them to coordinate in-home and community services; educate patients with chronic conditions; manage the psychological and social aspects of chronic care; provide effective nutritional guidance; and manage chronic pain.</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) Recent studies cited by the Congressional Budget Office found substantial differences among regions of the country in the cost to Medicare of treating beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions with lower cost regions experiencing better outcomes and lower mortality rates. These studies have suggested that Medicare spending could be reduced by 30 percent if more conservative practice styles were adopted, however, the current Medicare fee-for-service program creates incentives to provide  fragmented, high cost health care services.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Studies show that hospital utilization and emergency room visits for patients with multiple chronic conditions can be reduced and significant savings can be achieved through the use of interdisciplinary teams of health care professionals caring for patients in their places of residence.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The Independence at Home program, designed to fund better health care and improved health care technology through savings it achieves, uses a patient-centered health care delivery model to permit the growing number of Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions to remain as independent as possible for as long as possible and to receive care in a setting that is preferred by the beneficiary involved and the family of such beneficiary.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The Independence at Home program begins Medicare reform by creating incentives for practitioners and providers to develop methods and technologies for providing better and lower cost health care to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with the greatest incentives provided in the case of highest cost beneficiaries.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) The Independence at Home program incorporates lessons learned from prior demonstration projects and phase I of the Voluntary Chronic Care Improvement program under section 1807 of the Social Security Act, enacted in sections 721 and 722 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) The Independence at Home Act provides for a chronic care coordination demonstration for the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions that holds providers accountable for quality outcomes, patient satisfaction, and mandatory minimum savings on an annual basis.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) The Independence at Home Act generates savings by providing better, more coordinated care to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, reducing duplicative and unnecessary services, and avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="Introducing S. 3614. A bill to require semiannual indexing of mandatory Federal food assistance programs; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3614">S. 3614</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that, in the midst of this devastating economic crisis, continues to plague more and more Americans every day--hunger. Although hunger in this country may not be as obvious as it is in other nations, it nonetheless exists and has devastating consequences for those it affects. It weakens the body, making it more susceptible to illness. It impedes child development and reduces a child's ability to learn. It saps valuable energy, resulting  in lowered productivity and less earning potential. In short, hunger has a devastating effect on those it touches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 alone, the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, reported that 35.5 million Americans did not have enough money or resources to get food for at least some period during the year. This figure was an increase of 400,000 over 2005 and an increase of 2.3 million since 2000. And, with the fragile state of our economy, we can only assume that when the figures for 2007 and 2008 are released, the number of Americans living with hunger will be even greater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, for these millions of Americans facing hunger, the ability to afford the food they so desperately need has not become any easier over the past year. According to the Department of Labor, the cost of food at home rose 7.1 percent from July 2007 to July 2008. But, for the nearly 28 million Americans receiving food stamps, the effects of food price inflation during that time period were even more devastating. From July 2007 to July 2008, the cost of the "Thrifty Food Plan"--the  Government's estimate of what constitutes a nutritious, minimal cost meal plan--rose by 10 percent. As a result, the benefits currently provided to food stamp participants are not enough to even cover the cost of this minimally adequate diet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each summer, the United States Department of Agriculture sets new food stamp benefit levels based on the average of the previous year's food price inflation. However, these new benefit levels are not implemented until the first day of October each year, by which time they already lag behind current prices. For instance, when updated food stamp benefit levels were provided to an average family of four in October 2007, they were already lagging $12.20 behind the monthly cost of the Thrifty Food  Plan. By July of this year, that same family of four was receiving $56 per month less than they needed to afford the cost of this minimal diet. for such low-income families, already facing rising home energy and transportation costs, and having non-negotiable expenditures like rent or mortgage payments and child care expenses needing to be paid, food purchases are often the only area of the monthly budget where cuts can be made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, food price inflation is not only affecting the price families are paying for food at home. It is also affecting the prices schools are paying for foods provided through child nutrition programs like school breakfasts, lunches, and after-school snack programs. While the Federal Government does reimburse schools for the costs of providing these programs to children from low-income families, with ever rising food prices, these reimbursements are not enough to cover the expenses of providing  these meals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like food stamps, school meal reimbursement rates are updated every  summer to account for inflation. But, by the time the school year begins, these reimbursements already lag behind the true cost of producing the meal. In fact, a recent survey by the School Nutrition Association found that 88 percent of responding school districts indicated that Federal reimbursement rates were not sufficient to cover the costs of producing a meal during the 2007/08  school year. As a result, 73 percent of these school districts said they plan to increase the price other students pay for food services in this coming school year to make up for the increased costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress can and must do more to ensure that Federal nutrition assistance programs can adequately cover the costs of food for those most in need. That's why today I'm pleased to introduce the National Hunger Relief Act of 2008. This act will make critical changes needed to help low-income families and schools cover the costs of purchasing healthy, nutritious foods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this act, when setting benefit levels for food stamps, Congress would anticipate the food price inflation that will occur in the coming fiscal year, and would act to offset it by setting a higher benefit rate for October 1 than is currently provided. Beginning in fiscal year 2010, recipients would receive 102 percent of the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan in the previous June. By fiscal year 2012, this benefit rate would be ramped up to 103 percent of the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan in  the previous June. This change would be consistent with the way food stamp benefits were regularly adjusted for food price inflation for many years prior to 1996. By providing this higher benefit rate, food stamp benefits would be adequate to meet rising food prices over the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To solve the problem of inadequate reimbursement rates for certain child nutrition programs, this bill would provide for semi-annual reimbursement rate adjustments. In addition to the current annual update in July to reimbursement rates for school meal programs, reimbursement rates would also be adjusted for inflation each January. As a result of this change, reimbursement rates for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, the Special Milk Program, the Child and Adult Day Care Program,  and the Summer Food Service Program would more accurately reflect the costs that schools or service providers incur to provide foods through these programs. This, in turn, would help to keep the prices charged for foods provided to other children at schools more in line with the costs of procuring and providing those foods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am introducing this legislation today because it is critically important to begin the dialogue on finding ways to ensure that our nutrition assistance programs can continue to prevent hunger by providing necessary nourishment to Americans of all ages. However, I also recognize that we have a challenge to ensure that these nutrition assistance programs can operate in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible while adequately serving the more than 35.5 million Americans who continue  to be plagued by the threat of hunger. Over the coming months, as we continue to work on ways to eradicate hunger in this Nation and begin to consider the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act, I will continue seeking out ways to make reforms to this and other nutrition assistance legislation to ensure that--at the end of the day--these programs can continue to effectively reach those most in need.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="Introducing S. 3618. A bi11 to establish a research, development, demonstration, and commercial application program to promote research of appropriate technologies for heavy duty plug-in hybrid vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3618">S. 3618</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act, along with my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein. This bill will accelerate research of plug-in hybrid technologies for heavy duty trucks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Energy, DOE, administers several grants to speed production of hybrid cars, but DOE does not have a single grant specifically intended for trucks. Truck operators in Maine and around the country are being hit hard by high diesel prices. In 1999, a Maine truck driver could purchase $500 of diesel fuel and drive from Augusta, ME, all the way to Albuquerque, NM. Today, a driver who purchases $500 of diesel and leaves Augusta would not even make it to Altoona, PA, and because diesel  prices may well continue to increase, the problem is only getting worse. Plug-in hybrid trucks would make them less susceptible to dramatic swings in oil prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Industries turn their trucks over faster than consumers do their cars and can therefore adopt new technologies faster. This means reducing oil consumption by heavy duty trucks could go a long way toward reduce our Nation's oil consumption. DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that hybrid trucks could reduce fuel use by as much as 60 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current hybrid technology works well for cars because they can be made with lightweight materials and run shorter distances. Trucks need to be able to carry heavy loads and, if they are going to be plug-in hybrids, travel long distances in between charges. So, the battery and other technologies needed to make plug-in trucks a reality are more advanced than for cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act would direct DOE to expand its research in advanced energy storage technologies to include heavy hybrid trucks as well as passenger vehicles. The focus on plug-ins builds on a proven technology for cars that can drastically reduce our use of foreign oil and enhance the efficiency of the electric grid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grant recipients will be required to complete two phases. In phase one, recipients must build one plug-in hybrid truck, collect data and make comparisons to traditional trucks, and report on the fuel savings. In phase two, recipients must produce 50 plug-in hybrid trucks and report on the technological and market obstacles to widespread production. To help with this second phase, grant applicants can partner with other manufacturers. The bill authorizes $16 million for each of fiscal years 2009-2011  for the grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a comprehensive approach to addressing the energy crisis. The Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act is one vital piece of that approach. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="Introducing S. 3619. A bill to establish the Susquehana Gateway National Heritage Area in the State of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3619">S. 3619</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would establish the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area in York and Lancaster Counties, Pennsylvania. Since 1984, Congressionally-designated National Heritage Areas have fostered partnerships between the public and private sectors for undertaking preservation, educational, and recreational initiatives in diverse regions throughout the country. Through these efforts, National Heritage Areas have helped to protect our Nation's  natural and cultural resources while promoting local economic development. Today, I am proud to join my colleague from Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter to propose a bill that would grant national recognition to the Susquehanna Gateway region, an area that has played a key role in the development of our nation's cultural, political, and economic identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the region boasts an impressive catalogue of historic and scenic resources, perhaps two examples in particular best underscore how the distinct traditions and natural landscape of the Susquehanna Gateway offer an insight into the broader American experience. For centuries, the Susquehanna River, which forms a natural border between Pennsylvania's York and Lancaster Counties and represents the heart of the proposed National Heritage Area, has been at the center of agricultural, industrial,  and recreational activity in the Mid-Atlantic United States. The river provided colonial settlers with a trading route to Native American communities. It was an important shipping lane for timber, iron, coal, and agricultural products throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. With the decline of industry and commercial shipping in the region, the river today</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No less than in this tremendous natural resource, the Susquehanna Gateway region's national significance is rooted in its populace. As the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was founded in the spirit of providing refuge to those suffering religious and cultural persecution, so did York and Lancaster Counties offer a home to German Baptist immigrants who created Amish and Mennonite farming communities. By their example of humility, hard work, environmental stewardship, and respect for others, these</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to recognize the leadership of Mark Platts, President of the Lancaster-York Heritage Region, and his colleague Jonathan Pinkerton, Deputy Director. Through their tireless efforts, they have developed a feasibility study for the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area that meets the National Parks Service's ten interim criteria for designation of a National Heritage Area. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass the Susquehanna Gateway National  Heritage Area Act soon so that the region can begin to play a national role in sharing America's story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

(3) in 1999, a regional, collaborative public-private partnership of organizations and agencies began an initiative to assess historic sites in Lancaster and York Counties, Pennsylvania, for consideration as a Pennsylvania Heritage Area;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) the initiative--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) issued a feasibility study of significant stories, sites, and structures associated with Native American, African American, European American, Colonial American, Revolutionary, and Civil War history; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) concluded that the sites and area--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) possess historical, cultural, and architectural values of significance to the United States; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) retain a high degree of historical integrity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) in 2001, the feasibility study was followed by development of a management action plan and designation of the area by the State of Pennsylvania as an official Pennsylvania Heritage Area;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) in 2008, a feasibility study report for the Heritage Area--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) was prepared and submitted to the National Park Service--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) to document the significance of the area to the United States; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) to demonstrate compliance with the interim criteria of the National Park Service for National Heritage Area designation; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) found that throughout the history of the United States, Lancaster and York Counties and the Susquehanna Gateway region have played a key role in the development of the political, cultural, and economic identity of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the people of the region in which the Heritage Area is located have--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) advanced the cause of freedom; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) shared their agricultural bounty and industrial ingenuity with the world;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) the town and country landscapes and natural wonders of the area are visited and treasured by people from across the globe;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) for centuries, the Susquehanna River has been an important corridor of culture and commerce for the United States, playing key roles as a major fishery, transportation artery, power generator, and place for outdoor recreation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) the river and the region were a gateway to the early settlement of the ever-moving frontier;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) the area played a critical role as host to the Colonial government during a turning point in the Revolutionary War;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) the rural landscape created by the Amish and other Plain people of the region is of a scale and scope that is rare, if not entirely unknown in any other region, in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) for many people in the United States, the Plain people of the region personify the virtues of faith, honesty, community, and stewardship at the heart of the identity of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) the regional stories of people, land, and waterways in the area are essential parts of the story of the United States and exemplify the qualities inherent in a National Heritage Area;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) in 2008, the National Park Service found, based on a comprehensive review of the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area Feasibility Study Report, that the area meets the 10 interim criteria of the National Park Service for designation of a National Heritage Area;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (16) the preservation and interpretation of the sites within the Heritage Area will make a vital contribution to the understanding of the development and heritage of the United States for the education and benefit of present and future generations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (17) the Secretary of the Interior is responsible for protecting the historic and cultural resources of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (18) there are significant examples of historic and cultural resources within the Heritage Area that merit the involvement of the Federal Government, in cooperation with the management entity and State and local governmental bodies, to develop programs and projects to adequately conserve, support, protect, and interpret the heritage of the area;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (19) partnerships between the Federal Government, State and local governments, regional entities, the private sector, and citizens of the area offer the most effective opportunities for the enhancement and management of the historic sites throughout the Heritage Area to promote the cultural and historic attractions of the Heritage Area for visitors and the local economy; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (20) the Lancaster-York Heritage Region, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation and State-designated management entity of the Pennsylvania Heritage Area, would be an appropriate management entity for the Heritage Area.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="Introducing S. 3619. A bill to establish the Susquehana Gateway National Heritage Area in the State of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank my colleague and fellow Senator from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey, for introducing a bill designating the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National heritage areas are designated by Congress and recognized by the National Park Service for their natural, cultural, and historic significance. The proposed National Heritage Area is currently a State heritage area known as the Lancaster-York Heritage Region and meets the criteria for national designation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This region of southern Pennsylvania encompasses Lancaster and York counties and the portion of the Susquehanna River that connects the two counties. This area is home to numerous nature and wildlife preserves, State and local parks, trail systems and conservation areas, which celebrate and utilize the natural resources of the Susquehanna River and surrounding rural landscape. Both Lancaster and York counties have demonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining the open space and agricultural  heritage for which this area of Pennsylvania is known throughout the State and country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This region is perhaps most renowned and culturally distinctive for the Amish and Mennonite communities that have made Lancaster County their home for hundreds of years. Pennsylvania has the largest Amish population in the world, and Lancaster County has one of the largest Old Order Amish communities. The Old Order Amish have retained a traditional way of life and have resisted the incorporation of modern technology into their society. Visitors to Amish Country have a unique opportunity to observe  how the world looked and people behaved hundreds of years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This area is also rich in historical significance. Among the sites located in Lancaster and York counties that tell the story of our Nation's history is the home of James Buchanan, the only President from Pennsylvania, and the location where the Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation. Scattered throughout the two counties are centuries-old churches, train stations, homes, and other structures, many of which played important roles in history including stops on the Underground  Railroad and sites visited by President Lincoln on his way to Gettysburg to deliver the Gettysburg Address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This region is defined by the natural, cultural, and historical qualities that most certainly qualify it for National Heritage Area designation. I have been contacted by all six county commissioners, other local public officials, chambers of commerce, large corporations, small businesses, historical societies, preservation advocacy groups and others, urging congressional designation of the Susquehanna Gateway National Heritage Area. Additionally, I am informed that National Park Service Northeast  Regional Director Dennis Reidenbach has stated that this region meets Park Service standards for recognition as a national heritage area. Accordingly, I again thank Senator Casey and urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="Introducing S. 3620. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enable States to carry out quality initiatives, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3620">S. 3620</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Blanche Lincoln to introduce a very important bill for our Nation's working families, the Child Care Investment Act of 2008. Throughout our Nation, so many families today are struggling to provide for their families. One important action we can take to support working parents is to help ensure that their children are taken care of in safe and affordable childcare, and, most importantly, that this childcare is available  to them. Unfortunately, we know that so many families are not able to access childcare, much less childcare that is high quality. This leads some to leave their children with unqualified caregivers, and, too often, in a dangerous situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because families were facing such dire shortages of affordable child care, Congress developed the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 that founded the CCDBG program. Since that time, this program has benefited low-income families by providing them with the help they need to remain employed, care for their children and have the peace of mind that their children are being well cared for. However, much more can be done to support and increase the funding for this important program.  Recently, the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, NACCRRA, released a report on the cost of child care for parents in our Nation.Their findings were startling and further underline the call to action that Senator Lincoln and I feel is necessary for working parents. The NACCRRA report says that the cost of child care is rising at nearly</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During difficult economic times, the resources of families in our Nation become even more stretched. Decisions are often made within family budgets and sacrifices are made during times of lean. However, we owe it to our Nation's children to ensure that they are safe and cared for by responsible care providers while their parents work. Low-income parents should not be placed in a situation when they have to choose between their job and the safety of their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that Senator LINCOLN and I are introducing today will work to ensure more quality children care is available as the cost of this care increase and family budgets are squeezed. This bill will increase funding for the CCDBG program from $2.9 billion to $4 billion. It will also incorporate new quality goals for States to ensure quality care is given to our Nation's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator LINCOLN for her continuing commitment to this issue and to children in our Nation and ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation and quick passage.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="Introducing S. 3622. A bill to establish a grant program to promote the conservation of the Great Lakes and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3622">S. 3622</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the Great Lakes Conservation Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From orbit in space, the Great Lakes are the most recognizable feature of the North American landscape. And no wonder. The Great Lakes are the largest single source of fresh surface water in the world. They hold 90 percent of America's fresh surface water. They hold 20 percent of the world's fresh surface water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty-two million people call the Great Lakes basin home and rely on it for clean, safe water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is not evident from space, though, is the trash and other debris that litter the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Debris, in fact, is one of the most pervasive pollution problems affecting America's waterways. Debris detracts from the beauty of our Nation's coasts, threatens freshwater life, poses public health and safety concerns, and interferes with commercial and recreational boats and ships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the weekend, I participated in the Adopt-a-Beach clean-up on Lake Michigan. We started at Montrose Beach, stopped at both North Ave. and the 12th Street Beaches, and worked our way down to the 57th Street Beach. It was heartening to meet so many people who are committed to cleaning up the lake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Adopt-a-Beach program is one volunteer effort to clean up the beaches of the Great Lakes and increase public awareness of the seriousness of the litter problem. The program is run by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, a group dedicated to the conservation and restoration of this national treasure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adopt-a-Beach began in Illinois in 2002 and has quickly spread to neighboring states. It is a year-round program, but its chief event is a beach clean-up day each September, coordinated with the Ocean Conservancy's annual International Coastal Clean-up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens, organizations, and businesses are working together on efforts to restore the Great Lakes shorelines clean. We need to expand on these efforts and educate people throughout the Great Lakes about how they can help to cleanup and restore the lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am introducing the Great Lakes Conservation Education Act. This bill would authorize a new program within the Department of Commerce to provide funding for non-governmental organizations, museums, school, consortiums, and others to support conservation education and outreach programs to restore the Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to make this program a reality. We have a long way to go to restore the lakes and this legislation will make it possible for organizations through out the Great Lakes to educate students, teachers, and the general public about the steps they can take to improve the lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to authorize appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security--the first comprehensive DHS authorization bill introduced in the Senate in the 5-year history of this agency created in response to the attacks of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill is cosponsored by my friend and colleague, ranking member Senator SUSAN COLLINS, who has long been one of the Senate's great leaders in our efforts to make our nation more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand there is not time in this session for full consideration and passage of this legislation but we offer it as a blueprint for the next administration and the 111th Congress outlining key areas of improvement we think can make DHS more efficient and effective in its mission to safeguard our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I offer more detail on this bill, I would like to briefly review the history of the Department that has brought us to where we are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The attacks of 9/11 made it clear that oceans are no longer a defense against those who mean to harm our Nation. After a series of hearings, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee proposed legislation pulling more than 22 different agencies responsible for different areas of homeland defense into one Department whose overarching mission was the protection of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Success was not guaranteed. The administration and many in Congress at first opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security. But we persevered in our mission and President Bush signed legislation creating the Department in January 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all knew at the time that creating a new Department with a single identity out of 22 different agencies would be difficult. Each agency came into the Department with its own culture--not to mention its own procurement, personnel and computer systems. In some cases, they came after having been neglected in other Departments where homeland security had been an afterthought. There was, and remains, much work to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But over the past 5 years, the men and women who work at the Department, under the leadership first of Secretary Tom Ridge and now of Michael Chertoff, have worked hard, often under difficult circumstances, to systematically improve the Nation's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our committee has also written and helped pass several pieces of important legislation to strengthen and guide DHS as it evolved into a more mature agency. I would like to briefly mention some of them because I am proud of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's work under former Chairman SUSAN COLLINS and during my own tenure as chairman, because we truly worked as partners across party lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 108th Congress, our committee led the effort to enact the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States--otherwise known as the 9/11 Commission--a Commission which, had been created through the Committee's work in the previous Congress. The resulting Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 implemented most of the 41 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, including a number directed at the work of the new Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 109th Congress, in the wake of the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina, our committee conducted a far-reaching investigation into the actions at all levels of government that contributed to the disastrous response to the hurricane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held 22 hearings, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, and issued a comprehensive, 700-page report on what went wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee's findings on shortcomings at FEMA and DHS led us to draft the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which strengthened and elevated FEMA within the Department, brought together  into a single agency those charged with preparing for disasters with those responsible for responding to them; required planning for catastrophic events; and helped ensure that the resources of the whole Department would be available in a catastrophe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act was signed into law in October 2006, and the results of that Act can be seen in the much improved--though admittedly still imperfect--Federal response to the series of recent tornadoes in the Midwest and devastating hurricanes that have hit the Gulf Coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 109th Congress, our Committee helped draft and pass the SAFE Ports Act, to strengthen the Department's port security efforts, and we passed legislation to provide DHS authority to better secure dangerous chemical facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this Congress, after many hearings and much hard work, legislation implementing the final recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was signed into law. This legislation addressed a diverse array of issues at DHS, from homeland security grants to information sharing to interoperable communications to transportation security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while we offer this authorization bill as DHS readies for its sixth year as a department--and its first Presidential transition--this committee has been working hard all along to give DHS both the support it needed and the oversight--sometimes harsh--to steadily improve its capacity to carry out its critical mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this authorization act we continue that important work and I would like to touch on key portions of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill can be summarized under three major themes: integration, accountability, and effectiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have already noted, we knew when we passed the Homeland Security Act that the process of creating a new, unified Department out of many diverse component agencies would be both challenging and time consuming--and the process is not yet complete. Therefore, a number of provisions of this bill would improve the integration of the Department. These provisions are collectively intended to help the Department to perform its missions at a level that is greater than the sum of its parts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the bill would create an Under Secretary for Policy, to ensure that there is policy coordination across the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would also require the Secretary to develop and maintain the capability to coordinate operations and strategically plan across all of the component organizations of the Department. To this end, it permits the establishment of an Office of Operations Coordination and Planning within the Department, making it easier for the staffs of agencies such as the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, CBP, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and FEMA to work together on key operational  activities, such as planning for the upcoming DHS transition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would enhance the statutory authorities of the Chief Information Officer, allowing for greater control over IT investments in the Department. It also gives the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs of DHS new authority to coordinate the international activities of the Department. The bill would establish the Office of the Chief Learning Officer, who would coordinate training and workforce development activities on a Department-wide basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill would require the establishment of a consolidated headquarters for the Department of Homeland Security, which is long overdue. Currently, the Department is spread throughout 70 buildings and 40 sites across the National Capital Region making communication, coordination, and cooperation among DHS components a significant challenge. The deplorable condition of the present headquarters complex also makes it harder for DHS to recruit and retain talented professionals--directly affecting  homeland security--and I will continue to push Congress and the administration to get the funding necessary for the headquarters consolidation to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second major theme of the bill is accountability. The bill contains a number of provisions intended to enhance oversight and ensure that the Department is held accountable for the decisions that it makes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires that DHS have certified program managers for all major acquisition programs, and directs the Department to report to Congress on its use of various contracting authorities and on task orders within two of its major acquisition vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill creates a statutory requirement for a formal investment review process within the Department, and for investments where there are significant technological challenges, requires a formal testing and evaluation process prior to investment. These provisions will help to ensure that the Department does not again move forward with costly acquisitions without first proving that the underlying technology will work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also requires reports to Congress on a number of other activities, including the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative and the Department's efforts to improve minority representation among its employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third major theme of the bill is effectiveness. There are a number of homeland security mission areas where the Federal government needs new or expanded authorities to effectively address threats that face us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the bill addresses growing concerns about the cybersecurity threat by establishing a robust National Cyber Security Center with the mission of coordinating and enhancing Federal efforts to protect government networks, and by enhancing the statutory authorities of the National Cyber Security Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would enhance our nation's border security by authorizing an increase in the number of CBP officers and ensuring that they receive sufficient and appropriate training. It also recognizes the essential work of the agriculture specialists at the border, who perform plant inspections and help protect against both devastating pests and potential bioterrorism events, authorizes an increase in the number of agriculture specialists and requires measures to improve their recruitment and retention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill addresses the threat of improvised explosive devices, IEDs, by including provisions that would authorize the DHS Office of Bombing Prevention, OBP, as well as authorize an increase in its budget to $25 million. OBP would lead bombing prevention activities within DHS, and would coordinate with other Federal, State, and local agencies to ensure that existing gaps in Federal bombing prevention efforts are filled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Building upon changes already being implemented in the Post Katrina Act, the bill also seeks to continue improvement in the Nation's preparedness. It would require that DHS work with other Federal agencies to develop plans for responding to potential catastrophic scenarios, and would authorize a pilot program to assign National Guard planners to State emergency planning offices, to foster better State-Federal planning coordination. In addition, it would authorize the Metropolitan Medical Rescue  System to assist States and localities prepare for mass casualty events. It would reauthorize the Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Program, which provides grants to States for mitigation measures designed to reduce losses in disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Collectively the measures in this bill will improve the ability of the Department to carry out its missions and become a more mature and effective entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the reforms and enhancements contained in this legislation, along with continued, vigorous oversight, will make DHS a stronger agency in the years to come. And reform, not thoughtless reorganization, is the course future Ccngresses should follow when it comes to DHS. Five years into its mission, and ignoring some noticeable improvements in its performance, there are still those who believe DHS should be chopped up and its parts shipped off to other agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that is exactly the wrong course to take. It makes no sense to disrupt the development of the Department, and weaken the hand of the next Secretary, at a time when the challenges she or he must face, from preventing nuclear terrorism, to securing our borders, to ensuring more effective responses to catastropies of all kinds remain daunting. It took decades for the Department of Defense to become a  coherent whole, and its work is still not complete.  Just as DHS and its component arts are beginning to gel into an effective organization ready to deal with disasters visited upon our nation by nature or terrorists, it makes no sense to plunge responsibility for our homeland back into the chaos that existed before 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a course I have fought and will fight in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In their report to the nation, the 9/11 Commissioners wrote: "The men and women of the World War II generation rose to the challenges of the 1940s and the 1950s. They restructured the government so it could protect the country. That is now the job of the generation that experienced 9/11."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security was part of that response to the new dangers we face and must remain so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="Introducing S. 3626. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve access to health care through expanded health savings accounts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3626">S. 3626</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family and Retirement Health Investment Act of 2008. In these difficult economic times, many Utahns are facing the rising costs of health insurance and medical expenses. This bill would make it easier for families to decrease the cost of health insurance and encourage savings for retirement health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Briefly stated, this bill would enhance and improve Health Savings Accounts by addressing some of the questions and concerns that have been raised sine HSAs were first enacted in 2003 but were not addressed by the Health Opportunity Patient Empowerment Act of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health Savings Accounts were created as an alternative to traditional health insurance. HSAs allow participants to pay for current medical bills while saving for future health care expenses. One of the most attractive features of these accounts is the high degree of control the participants have over how to spend the money and how to manage investments within the account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since their creation, HSAs have become increasingly popular. Part of the reason for this is that Health Savings Accounts offer several important tax incentives. Earnings accrued on savings in an HSA are not taxed. Funds can also be withdrawn from an HSA 100 percent tax free, so long as the withdrawal is related to medical care. HSAs are very easy is set up. Anyone can go to his or her local bank, credit union, insurance company, or sometimes even their employer and request to create an HSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Broad agreement now exists that Congress must advance reform that will "bend the growth curve" in health care inflation. In recent years American families--often along with the businesses they own or work for--have been addressing this inflation on their own, by turning toward health savings account-eligible health plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to one survey, there are now 6.1 million people covered under health plans that are eligible for an HSA, including over 70,000 in my home state of Utah. This is a 35 percent increase over the previous year, and it is clear that businesses large and small see these plans as an innovative solution for their employees' health care needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, because HSAs offer lower premiums, existing businesses find that they are able to maintain coverage, while new businesses are able to extend health insurance to their employees. And increasingly, these businesses are funding their employee's HSAs just as they would a 401(k) plan. At the same time, the financial burden on families generally decreases under these plans due to lower premiums and a cap on out-of-pocket expenditures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given these attractive features, HSA-eligible health plans will only expand over time. In fact, a recent report estimates that the number of Health Savings Accounts will double between January 2008 and January 2009. It is appropriate, therefore, to continue to make common sense reforms to improve these plans for the families and businesses that are choosing them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this bill is all about. Among other things, the bill I am introducing would allow a husband and wife to make catch-up contributions to the same HSA; clarify the use of prescription drugs as preventive care that will not be subject to the deductible; promote wellness by expanding the definition of qualified medical expenses to encourage more exercise and better diet; and establish a more equitable tax treatment of health insurance by allowing individuals and families without employer-sponsored  insurance the ability to pay for their health insurance premiums with tax-deductible dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal is certainly not a substitute for broader health care reform. Instead, it seeks to improve an important and growing innovation that is a partial answer to the health care puzzle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senate prepares for a comprehensive health care debate in the coming months, it is important that we do what we can now to promote wellness, decrease costs, and increase coverage. By taking the intermediate steps proposed in this bill, we can facilitate broader reforms by decreasing costs and assisting businesses and families as they seek to make affordable health care choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I expect the popularity of HSAs will one day elevate the acronym to the level of IRAs, where no further clarification is required. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in a bipartisan effort to accelerate that process by supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Family and Retirement Health Investment Act of 2008</narrative>
  <narrative>This bill is designed to make certain enhancements and improvements to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) by addressing some of the questions and concerns that have been raised since HSAs were first enacted in 2003 but were not addressed by the HOPE Act of 2006.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 1. Short Title. </narrative>
  <narrative>Section 2. Catch-up Contributions by Spouses May Be Made to One Account.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current law allows HSA-eligible individuals age 55 or older to make additional catch-up contributions each year. However, the contributions must be deposited into separate HSA accounts even if both spouses are eligible to make catch-up contributions. Section 2 would allow the spouse who is the HSA account holder to double their catch-up contribution to account for their eligible spouse.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 3. Provisions Relating to Medicare.</narrative>
  <narrative>a. HSA-eligible seniors enrolled in Medicare Part A only may continue to contribute to their Health Savings Accounts.</narrative>
  <narrative>Current law restricts HSA participation by Medicare beneficiaries, which means that once a person turns 65, they usually may no longer contribute to their HSA (although they may continue to spend money from an existing HSA). For most seniors, enrollment in Medicare Part A is automatic when receiving Social Security and is difficult to delay or decline enrollment. However, the current deductible for hospital coverage under Medicare Part A is very high, over $1,000 per admission, nearly equal to  the minimum deductible required for HSA-qualified plans. Section 3(a) allows Medicare beneficiaries enrolled only in Part A to continue to contribute to their HSA accounts after turning 65 if they are otherwise eligible to contribute to an HSA.</narrative>
  <narrative>b. Medicare enrollees may contribute their own money to their Medicare Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).</narrative>
  <narrative>Current law prohibits Medicare beneficiaries enrolled Medicare Medical Savings Account from contributing their own money to their MSAs. Although created in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, Medicare MSAs are a relatively new type of plan under the Medicare Advantage program. MSA plans allow  seniors to enroll in a high-deductible plan and receive tax-free contributions from the federal government to HSA-like accounts. However, the government contribution  is significantly lower than the plan deductible, and the beneficiary may not contribute any of their own money to fill in the gap. Section 3(b) allows Medicare beneficiaries participating in a Medicare MSA plan to contribute their own tax-deductible money to their MSAs to cover the annual shortfall.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 4. Expanded Opportunities for Veterans </narrative>
  <narrative>Current law prohibits veterans from contributing to the their HSAs if they have utilized VA medical services in the past three months. The bill would remove those restrictions and allow veterans with a service-connected disability to contribute to their HSAs regardless of utilization of VA medical services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 5. Expanded Opportunities for Native Americans </narrative>
  <narrative>Current law prohibits Native Americans from contributing to their HSAs if they have utilized medical services of the Indian Health Service (IHS) or a tribal organization. The bill would remove those restriction and allow Native Americans to contribute to their HSAs regardless of utilization of IHS or tribal medical services.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 6. Improved Opportunities to Roll Over Funds From FSAs and HRAs to Fund HSAs. </narrative>
  <narrative>The HOPE Act of 2006 (<bill type="h" number="6111">H.R. 6111</bill>) allowed employer that offered Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs) or Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) to roll over unused funds to an HSA as employees transitioned to an HSA for the first time. However, the unused FSA funds may not be rolled over the HSAs unless the employer offers a "grace period" that allow medical expenses to be reimbursed from an FSA through March 15 of the following year (instead of the usual "use or lose" by December 31). In  addition, the amount that may be rolled over to the HSA cannot exceed the amount in such an account as of September 21, 2006. This provision effectively limits most employees from ever being able to use unused funds in an FSA or an HRA to help fund their HSAs. Section 6 clarifies current law to provide employers greater opportunity to roll over funds from employees' FSAs or HRAs to their HSAs in a future year in order to ease the transition from FSAs and HRAs to HSAs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 7. Expanded Opportunity to Purchase Health Insurance with HSA Funds. </narrative>
  <narrative>Under current law, people can only use their HSA account to pay for health insurance premiums when they are receiving federal or state unemployment benefits or are covered by a COBRA continuation policy from a former employer. In addition, HSA funds may not be used to pay for a spouse's Medicare premiums unless the HSA account holder is age 65 or older. Section 7 allows HSA account funds to be used to pay premiums for HSA-qualified policies regardless of their circumstances. This section also  clarifies that Medicare premiums for a spouse on Medicare are reimbursable from an HSA even though the HSA account holder is not age 65.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 8. Greater Flexibility Using HSA Account to Pay Expenses. </narrative>
  <narrative>When people enroll in an HSA-qualified plan, some let a few months elapse between the time when their coverage starts (e.g., January) and when the health savings bank account is set up and becomes operational (e.g., March). However, the IRS does not allow for medical expenses incurred in that gap (between January and March) to be reimbursed with HSA funds. Section 8 allows all "qualified medical expenses" (as defined under the tax code) incurred after HSA-qualified coverage begins to be reimbursed  from an HSA account as long as the account is established by April 15 of the following year.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 9. Expanded Definition of "Preventive" Drugs </narrative>
  <narrative>Current law allows "preventive care" services to be paid by HSA-qualified plans without being subject to the policy deductible. Although IRS guidance allows certain types of prescription drugs to be considered "preventive care," the guidance generally does not permit plans to include drugs that prevent complications resulting from chronic conditions. Section 9 expands the definition of "preventive care" to include medications that prevent worsening of or complications from chronic conditions.  This would provide additional flexibility to health plans that want to provide coverage for these medications and remove a perceived barrier to HSAs for people with chronic conditions.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sections 10-12. Expanded Definition of "Qualified Medical Expenses." </narrative>
  <narrative>With the increasing need to encourage Americans to take better care of their health and reduce the prevalence of obesity, Section 10 and 11 modify the definition of "qualified medical expenses" in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code to include the cost of:</narrative>
  <narrative>Exercise and physical fitness programs, up to $1,000 per year (Sec. 10)</narrative>
  <narrative>Nutritional and dietary supplements, including meal replacement products, up 7 to $1,000 per year (Sec. 11)</narrative>
  <narrative>The modification would affect all health care programs using the definition, including HSAs, HRAs, FSAs and the medical expense deduction when taxpayers itemize.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, the current definition of "qualified medical expenses" generally does not include fees charged by primary care physicians that offer pre-paid medical services on demand because there is no direct billing for individual services provided by the physician and the arrangement is not considered "insurance." Section 12 would allow amounts paid by patients to their primary physician in advance for the right to receive medical services on an as-needed basis to be considered a "qualified  medical expense" under the tax code. The modification would affect all health care programs using the definition, including HSAs, HRAs, FSAs, and the medical expense deduction when taxpayers itemize.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="Introducing S. 3627. A bill to improve the calculation of, the reporting of, and the accountability for, secondary school graduation rates; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3627">S. 3627</bill>] Mr. President, this fall our Nation's high school graduation class of 2012 took their first steps into their local high school as freshmen. The best research based on data from all 50 states tells us that  1/3  of that class of freshmen will not walk across a stage and receive their diploma with their peers in four years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically we face a national high school drop out crisis. Every year an estimated 1.23 million students drop out of high school. To put that number in perspective, it is equivalent to the entire population of the ninth largest city in the country, Dallas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are the facts of the Nation's dropout epidemic? We know that if you are Black or Hispanic it's essentially a 50-50 chance that you will graduate in 4 years. This disparity exists even in my home State of Iowa, one of the best states in the Nation in terms of graduating kids in 4 years. According to data from the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, 58 percent of African-American students in Iowa graduate in 4 years--almost 30 points lower than white students--while the graduation  rate for Hispanic students is only 54 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as the data on racial and ethnic minorities paints a grim picture, a look into the Nation's graduation rates for students with disabilities shows many students continue to be failed by the system. The most recent data indicates that slightly more than half of all students with disabilities graduated from high school with a regular diploma. Those rates go down when examining different categories of students with disabilities. For instance, only 43 percent of students with emotional disturbances  graduate from high school with a regular diploma. Bear in mind that many of these students do not have a learning disability, and with the proper supports and interventions they can achieve at the same levels expected of their non-disabled peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But these statistics may not even tell the full story. Too few States use a "cohort rate," which tracks students from high school entrance through exit. Because of the flexibility in No Child Left Behind, many States choose to employ a method of calculation that produces inflated reports due to undercounting dropouts. In 2005, the Government Accountability Office first documented troubling and inconsistent trends in graduation rate reporting. Unfortunately, because we lack of uniform measure  of graduation rates, hundreds of thousands of children are unaccounted for each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to these students to do a better job of tracking their progress towards graduation, and ensuring that they receive their high school diploma in 4 years. Census Bureau data shows there is a $9,000 discrepancy between the average income of a high school graduate and a high school dropout. In the middle of an economic crisis that is affecting American families' savings, an extra $9,000 would go a long way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But looking beyond the individual impact, an education system that properly educates its young people and graduates them in 4 years provides economic security for the country. Research by Cecilia Rouse, professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, shows that each drop out, over his or her lifetime, costs the Nation approximately $260,000. If more than 1 million students continue to dropout of high school each year, in 10 years that will amount to a cost of $3 trillion to  our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, we have our work cut out for us. Today I introduce the Every Student Counts Act, legislation that directly addresses the nation's dropout  crisis through the creation of one consistent graduation rate across all 50 states and by setting meaningful graduation rate goals and targets for schools, districts and States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we roll up our sleeves and get down to the serious business of solving the dropout crisis, we cannot waste our energy and our time arguing over whose data is correct. As I noted above, today we have 50 States with 50 different ways of measuring dropouts. In addition, we have many well-meaning education organizations with their own figures on high school graduation. It should be no surprise that they do not match up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take for example the difference in the graduation rates between those compiled by the independent Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, whose data is employed in Education Week's "Diplomas Count" annual report, and those currently reported by the States. While I think most would expect those rates to be relatively similar, they are not. In some States the difference between the two graduation rates is as much as 30 percentage points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the first thing the Every Student Count Act will do is make graduation rate calculations uniform and accurate. The bill requires that all States calculate their graduation rates in the same manner, allowing for more consistency and transparency. This bill will bring all 50 States together by requiring each State to report both a 4-year graduation rate and a cumulative graduation rate. A cumulative graduation rate will give parents a clear picture of how many students are graduating,  while acknowledging that not all children will graduate in 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But agreement on one graduation rate is only half the battle here. Schools, school districts and States that are not already graduating a high number of students must be required to make annual progress to high graduation rates. The Every Student Counts Act sets a graduation rate goal of 90 percent for all students and disadvantaged populations. Schools, districts and States with graduation rates below 90 percent, in the aggregate or for any subgroup, will be required to increase their graduation  rates an average of 3 percentage points per year in order to make adequate yearly progress required under the No Child Left Behind Law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to thank the growing list of organizations representing the interests of children across the country who have signed on to support the Every Student Counts Act. Specifically, I recognize the Alliance for Excellent Education and their President, former Governor of West Virginia Bob Wise, who have been champions in the movement to improve our high schools and turn back the dropout crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to recognize the work of my colleague in the House, Representative BOBBY SCOTT of Virginia, who is the chief sponsor of the companion to this legislation and has long championed education for disadvantaged young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have no more urgent educational challenge than bringing down the dropout rate, especially for minorities and children with disabilities. For reasons we all understand--poverty, poor nutrition, broken homes, disadvantaged childhoods--not all of our students come to school every day ready to learn. In some cases, it's as though they have been set up to fail. They grow frustrated. They drop out. As a result, they face a lifetime of fewer opportunities and lower earnings. Economically, our Nation  cannot afford to lose one million students each year. Morally, we cannot allow children to continue to fall through the cracks. I believe the Every Student Counts Act puts us on the right track towards turning back the tide of high school dropouts and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>September 26, 2008. </narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR HARKIN:  We, the undersigned education, civil rights, and advocacy organizations thank you for introducing the Every Student Counts Act to ensure meaningful accountability for the graduation rates of our nation's students. As you know, educators and policymakers at all levels of government agree that change is necessary on this issue.</narrative>
  <narrative>Only 70 percent of our nation's students graduate with a regular diploma. Worse, just over half of black and Hispanic students graduate on time. Special education students also have graduation rates of just over 50 percent. Such poor graduation rates are untenable in a global economy that demands an educated workforce. According to the Department of Labor, 90 percent of the fastest-growing and best-paying jobs in the United States require at least some postsecondary education. It is imperative  that the nation's schools prepare their students to succeed in the twenty-first-century workforce.</narrative>
  <narrative>The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) has focused the nation's attention on the unacceptable achievement gap and the need to improve outcomes for all students, particularly those of minority students, English language learners, and students with disabilities. However, NCLB does not place enough importance on graduating the nation's high school students. Furthermore, current federal policy on graduation rates permits the use of inconsistent and misleading graduation rate calculations that overestimate  graduation rates, does not require meaningful increases in graduation rates over time, and does not require the graduation rates of student subgroups to increase as part of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) determinations.</narrative>
  <narrative>As a response, the Secretary of Education has created proposed regulations to address these concerns. Although the proposed regulations are a laudable step in the right direction, we believe that the Every Student Counts Act is a better approach to ensuring that all students are treated equally in calculating graduation rates and for accountability purposes.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Every Student Counts Act would do the following: require a consistent and accurate calculation of graduation rates across all fifty states to ensure comparability and transparency; require that graduation rate calculations be disaggregated for both accountability and reporting purposes to ensure that school improvement activities focus on all students and close achievement gaps; ensure that graduation rates and test scores are treated equally in AYP determinations; require aggressive, attainable,  and uniform annual growth requirements as part of AYP to ensure consistent increases in graduation rates for all students; recognize that some small numbers of students take longer than four years to graduate and give credit to schools, school districts and states for graduating</narrative>
  <narrative>Again, we thank you for introducing the Every Student Counts Act and for your leadership on this critical issue.</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 3628. A bill to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to establish provisions with respect to religious accommodations in employment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3628">S. 3628</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduced a piece of legislation that  working on for over 10 years, the Workplace Religious Freedom Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Religious pluralism is a source of strength for this country. It always has been. That is why I support the Workplace Religious Freedom Act or WRFA, as I have ever since I first introduced it back in 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My personal involvement with this issue goes back to two Catholic women working at a dog-racing track in Raynham, Massachusetts. They were fired from their jobs because they refused to work on Christmas Eve. They felt it was against their religion to do business that night. We need to pass WRFA to make it clear that here in America, living out your faith is not a reason to lose your job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is designed to protect people just like those two women: workers suffering from on-the-job discrimination because of their religious beliefs and practices. It requires employers to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee's religious practice or observance, such as time off or dress. It protects, within reason, time off for religious observances. And it protects Yarmulkes, Hijabs, Turbans, Mormon garments--all the distinctive marks of our religious practices. All the things that  everyone should be proud of and nobody should ever be forced to hide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us should have the freedom to abide by and to express our religious beliefs--they are crucial to our individual and communal identities, and collectively, they are a crucial part of our national identity as a diverse and tolerant country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Writing religious freedom into law is by necessity a balancing act between universal values--such as religious tolerance and equal treatment--with the particulars that each of our faiths demand of us. Just as religious scholars wonder whether God can create an indestructible rock and then destroy it, scholars of religious pluralism have to answer a similar riddle: does a pluralism that's based on tolerance, tolerate intolerance?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Squaring this circle will always be a balancing act. Religious freedom in America doesn't mean the absolute right to impose your religion on others. With WRFA we have achieved that balance by protecting not only religious practices in the workplace but also by protecting those that don't share the same faith or choose not to practice at work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that if you look at the vast, vast majority of actual cases, protecting religious freedom turns out to be a matter of common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider the case of Jack Rosenberg, a 35-year-old Hasidic Jew from Rockland County, New York. Jack signed up for the Coast Guard and passed his training, only to .discover that he wasn't allowed to wear his yarmulke. "As soon as I got sworn in and got ready to put on the uniform," Mr. Rosenberg said, "the commander came to me and said it's going to be a problem." As Mr. Rosenberg said, "If my religion requires it, "there's not a choice." I agree: No American should raise his or religion  with an employer and be told: "it's going to be a problem." I am proud to say that the Coast Guard changed their regulations to allow for religious headgear. We fought for Jack Rosenberg and we won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another case involves a server at a Red Robin restaurant who belongs to the ancient Egyptian Kemetic religion, which doesn't allow him to hide his religious tattoos. Red Robin fired him for a wrist tattoo less than a quarter-inch wide. In the end, he won in court and Red Robin agreed to train managers to better understand religious discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't about litigation. It is about protecting the right of free expression and ensuring that religious people feel comfortable in the workplace. We must never leave anyone with the idea that practicing one's religion and being American are in conflict. That is fundamental to how we live as Americans, and I will fight to make sure that our laws governing religious freedom are worthy of our values.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="Introducing S. 3629. A bill to create a new Consumer Credit Safety Commission, to provide individual consumers of credit with better information and stronger protections, and to provide sellers of consumer credit with more regulatory certainty; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3629">S. 3629</bill>] Mr. President, we are in difficult times. The administration has informed us that the financial markets stand on the brink of collapse and that Congress must act quickly to allow the Treasury to intervene in the markets. We must not simply bail out the companies whose subprime mortgage practices put us in this situation in the first place. Many of us are working to include help for homeowners in any stabilization we consider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we must also look beyond the immediate crisis and take steps to prevent similar abuses and errors in the future. This crisis started when lenders sold too many faulty mortgages to families who had too little protection against such practices. Once this immediate crisis passes, Congress must act to ensure that this never happens again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our financial system requires a fundamental overhaul, so that the needs of American families stand above the interests of Wall Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To start that discussion, today I am introducing the Consumer Credit Safety Commission Act. This bill would put a single government agency in charge of ensuring that the offering of financial products to consumers is responsible, accountable, and transparent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new agency would look out for consumers first, so that the Fed, the FDIC, and the rest of the alphabet soup of financial regulators can focus more effectively on the safety and soundness of our financial system while not letting consumer protection fall by the wayside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agency would be able to move quickly to protect consumers from new predatory practices, much faster than Congress ever could. It would provide continuous oversight of the financial services market, and hold companies accountable when they abuse, deceive, or take advantage of the consumers they claim to be helping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me put it this way, as Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren has done: why is it that 1 in 10 toasters do not catch fire in our homes, but 1 in 10 home mortgages are failing? The answer is that toasters are properly regulated and financial products are not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not believe that the Government should regulate the freedom out of our markets, and I do not believe that we should eliminate prudent risk taking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the contrary: moderate, sensible, and targeted regulation creates an environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit of America can thrive, but without the unnecessary booms and busts of the Wild West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Consumer Credit Safety Commission will add consumer protection to the factors lenders must consider in creating and offering financial products. It will identify the practices that undermine sound markets and put a stop to them before they bring the entire financial market to its knees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Starting early next year, Congress will try to establish the oversight and accountability mechanisms that will foster a dynamic and more responsible environment for financial products. This bill provides us with a good place to start. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation and working to create an agency that truly puts consumers first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="Introducing S. 3633. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require country of origin labeling on prescription and over-the-counter drugs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3633">S. 3633</bill>] Mr. President, in the past year, 149 Americans died after taking tainted Heparin, a widely used blood thinner. It was later learned--as reported in the New York Times--that the contaminant derived from pig intestines was produced in "largely unregulated" Chinese workshops. Unfortunately, Heparin is not the only drug that relies on this dangerous brand of outsourcing. More and more, drug companies are taking advantage of cheap labor and weak safety standards found outside of the U.S.  to manufacture the pharmaceuticals later used in American hospitals and households. According to a Pfizer representative who testified before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions in April, Pfizer outsources the manufacture of 17 percent of its drug products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumers have a right to know where their drugs are produced. That is why I am today introducing the Transparency in Drug Labeling Act. This bill would require country-of-origin labeling for both active and inactive ingredients on all pharmaceuticals, both prescription and over-the-counter. These new drug labels would list all the countries that played a role in the manufacturing of ingredients for the drug. The order of the list would be determined by the percentage of the drug produced in  each country, with the largest contributors appearing at the top.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would raise consumers' awareness of where their drugs are being produced. It would also allow companies who produce their drugs in the U.S. to advertise that fact. Drug companies that produce their drugs in the U.S. and follow the corresponding safety and regulatory standards should be rewarded with increased consumer confidence in their products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes a proactive approach to keeping Americans safe in our global, interdependent economy. When we import from overseas, we are importing the health, labor and environmental standards of those countries as well. Consumers have a right to know where their medications originate. This bill would satisfy that reasonable demand.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="Introducing S. 3634. A bill to reduce gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk purchases of handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3634">S. 3634</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to introduce the End Gun Trafficking Act of 2008. I am proud to be joined by my colleague from New Jersey, Senator MENENDEZ, in introducing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trafficking in illegal guns is a serious problem that fuels crime, drug activity, and gang violence in our communities and on our streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current Federal law, gun purchasers are able to buy--and gun dealers are able to sell--unlimited numbers of handguns. All too frequently, these bulk handgun purchasers turn around and sell those handguns on the black market. The guns are sold to criminals and gang members--people who are barred under Federal law from buying guns themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This pipeline of illegal guns threatens States' abilities to protect their own residents, as guns are often purchased in bulk in States with weak gun laws and sold to criminals in States with tougher gun laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State of New Jersey has some of the strongest gun violence prevention laws in the country, including a ban on assault weapons, child access prevention requirements, and permitting requirements for gun ownership. Unfortunately, because of the gun trafficking pipeline, illegal weapons make their way onto New Jersey's streets and place all New Jerseyans in danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, 72 percent of the guns recovered from New Jersey crime scenes that were traced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives came from out of State. Just six States accounted for nearly 50 percent of those traced guns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As these numbers make all too clear, we will only give full effect to New Jersey's and other State's effort protect their residents when we shut down the "iron pipeline" of gun trafficking. To stop gun trafficking, we must stop the bulk sales of handguns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that I introduce today would do exactly that. The End Gun Trafficking Act of 2008 would limit gun buyers to one handgun every 30 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This "one-handgun-a-month" approach is proven. Today, States--Virginia, Maryland, and California--have such laws. Before enacting this law in 1993, Virginia was the supplier of choice for criminals up and down the East Coast. A 1995 study showed drastic reductions in the flow of Virginia guns to criminals in other States: the percentage of crime guns traced back to Virginia fell by 71 percent in New York and 72 percent in Massachusetts. Unfortunately, despite these results, Virginia significantly  weakened its law in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that New Jersey will be the fourth State to limit handgun purchases to one a month. In July, the New Jersey Assembly approved a one-handgun-a-month bill that is awaiting action in the State Senate. I strongly support this legislation, which will help cut down on the illegal gun trade within New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to really combat interstate gun trafficking, we need a national solution. The End Gun Trafficking Act is an important step in that direction. Specifically, this legislation would prohibit gun dealers from selling a handgun to an unlicensed person who they know or have reason to believe has purchased another handgun within the previous 30 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would prohibit unlicensed individuals from purchasing more than one handgun during a 30-day period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would make exceptions for exchanges, Government, and law enforcement purchases and curios and relics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would ensure that the background check system checks whether a buyer has purchased a handgun within the last 30 days and block handgun sales to such buyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would increase the maximum penalty from 1 year to 5 years for gun dealers who make false statements in their gun sale records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would require that background checks be kept for at least 180 days instead of the current 24 hours, to allow dealers to find out whether an individual has purchased another handgun within the previous 30 days and make unlicensed gun dealers who sell more than one handgun a month to an unlicensed individual subject to the same laws as licensed gun dealers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation and reduce gun violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3635">S. 3635</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is very near and dear to my heart: the importance of mentoring. A good mentor can make all the difference in the world, serving as friend, role-model and advocate for children who need it most. We should be rewarding those young people who commit to public service, including mentoring at-risk children, and offering incentives to encourage wider participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to introduce the Supporting Mentors, Supporting Our Youth Act, which would forgive $10 of student loans for every hour of mentoring with a minimum commitment of one year of service. I'm pleased that my friend and colleague, Congressman JIM CROWLEY, is introducing this legislation in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long been an advocate for mentoring and for supporting mentoring programs like the ones you run across the country. Last year, I joined my colleague Senator KERRY in introducing the Mentoring America's Children Act, which built upon the Mentoring Program in No Child Left Behind. This legislation will help reach the 15 million young adults who could use mentor--esspecially young people in foster care and other young adults who could benefit the most from a role model, advisor, and  advocate. I've long been a champion for mentoring and for supporting mentoring programs like the ones you run across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public service is the lifeblood of our communities and mentoring at-risk children is particularly important. Tomorrow, September 27th, is the National Day of Action and I could not think of a better way of supporting the thousands of communities who will mobilize across the country then by introducing this legislation to encourage more people to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, I joined Senators KENNEDY and HATCH in introducing the Serve America Act. The legislation would build a new service corps focused on addressing areas of national need such as education, energy and the environment. The bill would increase opportunities to participate in service for Americans of all ages by encourage students to make service a part of their lives, establishing tax incentives for employers who allow employees paid leave for service, and structuring  service opportunities for seniors and retirees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the Senate and the House to stand up for our most vulnerable children, while making college more accessible and more affordable.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on a subject that is never far from the minds of citizens in my home State of Florida and others living along our coasts and in tornado alley: the threat of windstorms, and the havoc that these events can wreak on our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were all transfixed by the non-stop news coverage as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike grew into monster storms and crossed the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, leaving a trail of misery in their wake. In Florida this year, these storms, along with Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Hanna, reminded us of our vulnerability in the face of Mother Nature. We are not out of the woods yet. Hurricane season lasts for another two months, and other severe storms can generate damaging tornadoes at any time of year.  In fact, more than 2,000 tornadoes had hit the United States by mid-September, causing more than 120 fatalities and making 2008 the deadliest year for windstorm-related fatalities in a decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although windstorms are a perpetual hazard, particularly in Florida, we have learned a great deal from these events and have taken steps to make our homes, businesses, and infrastructure more resilient. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida and revealed a number of problems with how we designed and constructed buildings in areas subject to high winds. The lessons learned from Andrew drove the adoption of stronger buiding codes in Miami-Dade and Broward counties in 1994, codes that  still serve as models for the Nation. In 2001, Florida's State legislature adopted a statewide building code, which made building requirements stronger and more consistent across the state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These actions have already started paying dividends. In 2004, when Hurricane Charley made landfall near Captiva Island as a Category 4 hurricane, communities across Southwest Florida   suffered tremendous damage from high winds and floodwaters. In Charlotte County alone, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA , estimated that 80 percent of the buildings were damaged and all mobile homes were destroyed. Across the Florida peninsula, 30 deaths were linked to the storm and property damage  was estimated at $14.6 billion. But there was some positive news to be found amongst the devastation. Government and private-sector experts who reviewed Charley's damage found that homes designed and constructed with the stronger, post-Andrew building codes performed well, even in Punta Gorda, one of the hardest-hit areas. There can be no doubt that many lives were saved and millions in additional damages were avoided as a direct consequence of earlier decisions to build stronger and safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our experience in Charley shows that we are on the right track in anti ipating and avoiding windstorm impacts, we cannot rest on our laurels. Millions in Florida and across our Nation live in structures built either before there was a building code in effect or before important wind-resistant materials and practices became required. Much work remains to find feasible and cost-effective ways to retrofit these older structures, and to educate our citizens on the need to take actions now to  reduce their vulnerability to future windstorms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help address these outstanding needs, I  am introducing the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Reauthorization Act of 2008. This legislation would extend and enhance the National Windstorm Impact Reduction program , the primary goal of which is to achieve major, measurable reductions in losses of life and property from windstorms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a program that I have a long history of supporting. In July 2004--just weeks before four hurricanes, Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeann e struck m y State--I introduced the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004. This bill sought to focus the Federal efforts to identify wind hazards and assess and mitigate windstorm impacts. In the wake of the 2004   hurricanes, Congress saw the need to better coordinate and invest in wind-related research and mitigation, and passed separate legislation  establishing NWIRP in October of that year. At that time, Congress's vision was for NWIRP to improve our understanding of windstorms and then mitigate potential impacts through nationwide data collection and analysis, risk assessment, outreach, technology transfer, and research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its enactment in 2004, NWIRP has struggled to get off of the ground. The Bush Administration has not adequately supported the development and implementation of the program, failing to request any appropriations for  NWIRP activities at the primary agencies: the National Institute of Standards and Technology, th e National Science Foundation,  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  and FEMA. Despite explicit language from Congress in  its report accompanying th e fiscal year 2008 omnibus appropriations bill, the Administration has refused to allocate the more than $11 million designated for NWIRP. I find this lack of cooperation on NWIRP, a program that can help save lives and avoid property damage, to be particularly troubling as millions of people on the Gulf Coast and in Florida struggle to recover from recent hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I will continue my efforts to obtain additional funding for NWIRP, Congress must help by extending the program past its expiration on September 30th of this year. My legislation would extend NWIRP through 2013, and make several other programmatic changes that are needed to put the program on a stronger footing moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I propose shifting primary authority and responsibility for managing NWIRP from the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy to NIST, an agency that has excelled in leading the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program since 2004. My legislation would also clarify the roles and responsibilities of all Federal agencies participating on NWIRP's  Interagency Working Group on Windstorm Impact Reduction. Three Federal agencies with current missions that provide valuable data or expertise  that support NWIRP's goals will be added to the program, namely the Department of Transportation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Lastly, the legislation would set a deadline for NIST to assemble the National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, a group charged with providing guidance to NIST and the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did not want to return to Florida this fall without taking action to keep us focused on reducing the impacts of windstorms on our citizens and our economy. That is why I felt it important to propose this legislation to extend, revamp, and revitalize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to recognize the efforts of Representative Dennis Moore of Kansas, who is introducing a companion measure in the U.S. House of Representatives today. Kansas is particularly vulnerable to the devastation that tornados and hailstorms can cause, so I know that he shares my desire to ensure that our constituents have innovative, effective, and affordable tools available to help reduce their vulnerability to windstorms. I also understand that three members of the  Florida delegation in the House, Representatives Alcee Hastings, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and MARIO DIAZ-BALART, are original cosponsors of Representative MOORE's bill. In addition to demonstrating how important this legislation is to the State of the Florida and the</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, in a democracy, no right is more important than the right to vote; in our democracy, no right has been so dearly won. This country was founded on the idea that a just government derives its power from the consent of the governed, a principle codified in the very first words of our Constitution: "We the People of the United States." From the Civil War through the women's suffrage movement through the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through the 26th Amendment, the continuing  expansion of the franchise, a broadening of who "we the people" are, is one of our great American stories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today I will introduce the Democracy Restoration Act of 2008. This bill will guarantee that citizens who are not incarcerated have the right to vote in Federal elections. I am pleased that the Senator from Rhode Island, Sen. Whitehouse, and the Senator from Maryland, Sen. Cardin, have agreed to be a cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once, only wealthy White men could vote in this country. Once, African Americans, ethnic minorities, women, young people, the poor, and the uneducated were all excluded. Today, we look back at those times and wonder how our country could have denied its citizens such a fundamental right for so long. And yet today, we continue to disenfranchise an estimated 4 million of our fellow citizens who were convicted of felonies but are no longer in prison. Two million of these people have fully served  their sentences, and the other two million are on probation, parole, or supervised release. These people are living and working in the community, paying taxes, and contributing to society. But they cannot vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, 10 states still strip people who have completed their sentence--who have paid their debt to society--of their right to vote. Some 35 States deny the vote to people on parole, and 30 of those States also deny the vote to people on probation. I believe that the practice of stripping our fellow citizens of their voting rights is un-American. It weakens our democracy. It is an anachronism, one of the last vestiges of a medieval jurisprudence that declared convicted criminals to be outlaws,  irrevocably expelled from society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This principle was called "civil death" and in medieval Europe, it was reserved for the worst crimes. Yet today, here, in the greatest democracy in the world, we continue to sentence 4 million people--people who have served their time, people who are contributing members of society--to civil death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One might ask how something as undemocratic as civil death could have survived to the present day. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the practice of disenfranchising people with felony convictions has an explicitly racist history. Like the grandfather clause, the literacy test, and the poll tax, civil death became a tool of Jim Crow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across the country, 13 percent of African-American men are disenfranchised because of a felony conviction. As of 2004, in 14 states, felony disenfranchisement provisions had stripped more than 10 percent of the entire African-American voting-age population of the right to vote. In 4 states, they had disenfranchise more than 20 percent of eligible African-American voters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The architects of Jim Crow would be proud of their handiwork, and how it has lasted long after the rest of their evil system was dismantled. The rest of us should be ashamed, and yes, outraged. If we believe in redemption, we should be outraged. Because civil death has denied 4 million Americans a chance at redemption. If we believe in progress, we should be outraged. Because civil death keeps this country chained to the worst moments of our past. If we believe in democracy, we should be outraged.  Because civil death strikes at the heart of our democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a growing movement across the country to expand the franchise and restore voting rights to people coming out of prison and reentering the community. In the last decade, 16 States have reformed their laws to expand the franchise or ease voting rights restoration procedures. This bill continues that movement. It provides that the right to vote for candidates for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because a person has been convicted of a crime unless that person is actually  in prison serving a felony sentence. It gives the Attorney General of the United States the power to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief to enforce that right. And it gives a person whose rights are being violated a right to go to court to get relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also requires Federal and State officials to notify individuals of their right to vote once their sentences have been served. This is an important part of the bill, given the long history of these civil death provisions. Even after this bill passes, many ex-offenders may not know their rights, and we should take affirmative steps to make sure that they do. No one should be disenfranchised because of lack of information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Johnson said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vote is the powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When prisoners return to their communities after serving their sentences, we expect and hope that they will reintegrate themselves into society as productive citizens. Yet, without the right to vote, rehabilitated felons are already a step behind in regaining a sense of civic responsibility and commitment to their communities. If our country wants ex-offenders to succeed at becoming better citizens, who both abide by the law and act as responsible individuals, then we need to restore this most  fundamental right. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="s" number="3640">S. 3640</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Democracy Restoration Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates offenders into free society, helping to enhance public safety.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United States grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the Supreme Court.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal protection require an equal opportunity for Americans to vote in Federal elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, gender or previous condition of servitude. The 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution empower Congress to enact measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections.</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) There are three areas where discrepancies in State laws regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal elections:  (A) there is no uniform standard for voting in Federal elections which leads to an unfair disparity and unequal participation in Federal elections based solely on where a person lives; (B) laws governing the restoration of voting rights after a felony conviction are unequal throughout the country and persons in some States  can easily regain their voting rights while in other States persons effectively lose their right to vote permanently; and (C) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact racial ethnic minorities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Disenfranchisement results from varying State laws that restrict voting while under some form of criminal justice supervision or after the completion of a felony sentence in some States. Two States do not disenfranchise felons at all (Maine and Vermont). Forty-eight States and the District of Columbia have disenfranchisement laws that deprive convicted offenders of the right to vote while they are in prison. In thirty-five States, convicted offenders may not vote while they are on parole  and thirty of these States disenfranchise felony probationers as well. In ten States, a conviction can result in lifetime disenfranchisement.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) An estimated 5,300,000 Americans, or about one in forty-one adults, currently cannot vote as a result of a felony conviction. Nearly 4,000,000 (74 percent) of the 5,300,000 disqualified voters are not in prison, but are on probation or parole, or are ex-offenders. Approximately 2,000,000 of those individuals are individuals who have completed their entire sentence, including probation and parole, yet remain disenfranchised.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often illusory. Offenders must either obtain a pardon or order from the Governor or action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Offenders convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining voting rights.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) In at least 16 States, Federal offenders cannot use the State procedure for restoring their civil rights. The only method provided by Federal law for restoring voting rights to ex-offenders is a Presidential pardon. Few persons who seek to have their right to vote restored have the financial and political resources needed to succeed.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact ethnic minorities. Thirteen percent of the African American adult male population, or 1,400,000 African American men, are disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, three in ten of the next generation of black men will be disenfranchised at some point during their lifetime. Hispanic citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised since they are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a felony offense and who are living and working in the community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) State disenfranchisement laws suppress electoral participation among eligible voters and damage the integrity of the electoral process. State disenfranchisement laws significantly impact the rate of electoral participation among the children of disenfranchised parents.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) The United States in the only Western democracy that permits the permanent denial of voting rights to individuals with felony convictions.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Attorney General.--The Attorney General may, in a civil action, obtain such declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to remedy a violation of this Act.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Private Right of Action.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) A person who is aggrieved by a violation of this Act may provide written notice of the violation to the chief election official of the State involved.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a notice under paragraph (1), or within 20 days after receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within 120 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person may, in a civil action obtain declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) If the violation occurred within 30 days before the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved person need not provide notice to the chief election official of the State under paragraph (1) before bringing a civil action to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 5.
