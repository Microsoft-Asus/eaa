  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="HONORING RETIRED MAJOR D. BROCK FOSTER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the service of a great American--U.S. Air Force retired MAJ D. Brock Foster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Ohio who served his country in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, Major Foster demonstrated uncommon courage while flying as an A-1 Skyraider during a rescue mission near the Ho Chi Minh Trail on June 28, 1968. At great risk to his personal safety, Major Foster remained in the rescue area amid heavy antiaircraft artillery and enemy fire to make repeated passes to protect the rescue helicopter. Major Foster's selfless heroism enabled the successful rescue of the Navy pilot who had been  encircled by hostile forces for more than 39 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 40 years later, Major Foster is receiving long overdue recognition for his sacrifice and valor and will be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Given to those who distinguish themselves in aerial flight by taking heroic actions above and beyond the call of duty, the Distinguished Flying Cross is a fitting recognition of Major Foster's unwavering dedication to the service of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to honor this great Ohioan. His heroic actions and dedication to the U.S. Air Force and his fellow servicemen are an inspiration to all Americans.</paragraph>
