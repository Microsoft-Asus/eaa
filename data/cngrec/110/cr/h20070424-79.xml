  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wilson) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, being from Ohio and speaking on this issue is really quite easy because Ohio leads the Nation in predatory lending and in foreclosures, an unfortunate statistic that we are not proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a new Member of Congress and one that has worked very hard in the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate to pass legislation against predatory lending, I feel it a real calling to be one who speaks up strongly here in the Congress on the same type of issue that people are being taken advantage of in a big way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, Ohio's working families are paying the price, and in many cases, they are paying with their homes. In fact, Ohio leads the Nation, as I said, in foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, Mr. Speaker, in southeastern Ohio, from the suburbs of Youngstown to the small rural communities along the West Virginia and the Kentucky borders, predatory lenders are targeting honest Ohioans who only want one thing: they want a chance to purchase a home of their own and live the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For millions who struggle with bad credit, these subprime and adjustable rate mortgages seem like the perfect opportunity to correct their problems. But in reality, when it sets in, it is the worst solution that they could choose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rates begin to skyrocket, late fees pile up, and before long it is too late. Too many families are losing their homes to foreclosure. Too many families are being left out in the cold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The numbers are alarming. These subprime loans account for 63 percent of Ohio's foreclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a problem that has spread far beyond Ohio to our  major cities all across America. In fact, two-thirds of the subprime loans are used in non-urban areas as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's working families are being challenged in so many ways. While wages stay flat or decline, we have seen people's gas prices and health care costs continue to soar. It's time that our working families finally get the relief they deserve, and taking on predatory lenders has to be a part of the solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Senate, as I said, I joined colleagues to work on Ohio's predatory lending laws. I work on this important issue here in Washington also, because I believe it's an important one for the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things I did was to take a first step in introducing House Resolution 1723. It's a bill that I introduced that targets FHA home loans. It clearly outlines unacceptable practices that could be used in an attempt to influence an appraisal on a home. It also puts in place a blind draw, a system that would randomly select the appraiser, rather than having loan companies have favorites that they use to make unrealistic appraisals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ensuring that homes are appraised fairly is an important piece of the puzzle. Many borrowers cannot refinance or sell to avoid defaulting because their property is not worth what they owe on the home. Too often, the original mortgage is based on the inflated appraisal, and <bill type="h" number="1723">H.R. 1723</bill> will keep that from happening when it comes to FHA loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Families across the Nation are now feeling the kind of pain that we in Ohio have suffered; 2.2 million subprime home loans made in recent years have already failed, or will in foreclosure. These foreclosures will cost homeowners as much as $164 million, and that figure only begins to describe the cost to the families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our sons and daughters, our mothers and fathers, are losing their homes, and in the process they are losing their hold on the American dream. Our working families deserve real relief, not just empty words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge this Congress to take a strong stand on predatory lending. We must make sure that Americans' dream of home ownership does not turn into a nightmare for even more families.</paragraph>
