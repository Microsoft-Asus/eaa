    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will pass by unanimous consent <bill type="s" number="980">S. 980</bill>, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act. This is an important bill that would create potent new tools for law enforcement to prosecute those who illegally sell drugs online, and allow State authorities to shut down online pharmacies even before they get started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Sessions for their commitment to combating illicit drug trafficking by online predators. Their hard work and diligent efforts, have put together a strong bipartisan bill that includes important modifications and clarifications that will protect our children and grandchildren from purchasing illegal dangerous drugs online and reducing the prevalence of rogue online pharmacies in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the longtime cochair of the Congressional Internet Caucus, I understand full well the growing danger that illegitimate online pharmacies pose to youth. I am pleased to join the bill's sponsors in support of this legislation. I am also very pleased that several of my recommendations to improve the bill are included in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill could not come at a more urgent time for our Nation. In the digital age, the Internet has enabled all Americans better access to convenient and more affordable medicine. Unfortunately, the prevalence of rogue online pharmacies has also made the Internet an increasing source for the sale of dangerous controlled substances without a licensed medical practitioner's valid prescription. Online drug traffickers have used evolving tactics to evade detection by law enforcement and circumvent  the proper constraints of doctors and pharmacists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The check and security provided by our local pharmacists in local pharmacies--those who have served Americans for generations and helped us get well and keep us well--is not always replicated online. As a result, dangerous and addictive prescription drugs are too often only a click away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last May, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this issue. We heard compelling testimony from Francine Haight, a mother whose teenage son died from an overdose of painkillers he purchased online from a rogue pharmacy. We also heard from Joseph  Califano, the former Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Both strongly supported legislation to fill a gap in existing law and help protect young people from illicit drugs online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following our hearing, the Internet Drug Advisory Committee held a briefing for the Judiciary Committee on this matter. We heard from various members of the Internet community on how the private sector may effectively collaborate with the public sector to combat the sales of dangerous drugs online. These private sector groups will be vital in that effort, and we were happy to receive the benefit of their insights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration supports this bill, and that is the right thing to do. I know that our hard working men and women at the Drug Enforcement Agency need the added tools this bill would offer to assist their efforts to combat rogue online pharmacies. Even more, our children and grandchildren need the safety and security of operating online free from drug dealers seeking to trick them into purchasing dangerous controlled substances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Judiciary Committee reported an amendment in the form of a substitute which includes several recommendations I have made to improve the bill and make it more effective. These changes were later perfected and improved upon after the bill was reported out of Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the amendment includes my suggestion that the Drug Enforcement Administration report to Congress on recommendations to combat the online sale of controlled substances from foreign countries via the Internet and on ways that the private sector can assist in this effort. A key ingredient in diminishing the impact of rogue Web sites on American citizens is combating the international aspect of this problem, and strengthening the public-private sector collaboration can help provide  a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment narrows the U.S. Sentencing Commission directive to ensure that the most dangerous prescription drugs abused online are treated more severely than less harmful prescription drugs. This addition will ensure that the commission has clear guidance to issue the guidelines necessary to hold those individuals who peddle dangerous prescription drugs to minors online accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also protects legitimate retail drug chains with online websites for customers seeking refills on prescriptions, by exempting them from the bill's requirements. This ensures that the bill does not target legitimate pharmacies that provide Vermonters and other Americans with access to needed medicines nor does it burden legitimate pharmacies with additional registration and reporting requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this measure will be better with these changes. I am confident that this legislation will strengthen our Nation's ability to effectively combat online drug trafficking. It furthers the goals of drug enforcement and deterrence, while also providing Congress with additional oversight tools. I support its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for passing <bill type="s" number="980">S. 980</bill>, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Senator Sessions, I introduced this bill to protect the safety of consumers who wish to fill legitimate prescriptions for controlled substances over the Internet, while holding accountable those who operate unregistered pharmacies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, the Senate took the first important step in stemming the tide of online drug trafficking. Perhaps more importantly, the Senate took the first steps in ensuring that children and teens no longer overdose, or worse die, after purchasing controlled substances without a prescription from rogue Internet pharmacies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to clarify that the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 regulates practices related to the delivery, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance by means of the Internet. The act does not address the delivery, distribution, or dispensing of any noncontrolled substance by the Internet or any other means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does not infringe upon the powers of the Department of Health and Human Services and its Secretary with respect to noncontrolled substances. Nor does it infringe upon the traditional power of the States to regulate the practices of medicine and pharmacy with respect to the prescription of non controlled substances. Delivery, distribution, or dispensing of noncontrolled substances, approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the regulatory bodies of the States, are not  affected by the act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would do the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bar the sale or distribution of all controlled substances over the Internet without a valid prescription; Require online pharmacies to display on their Web site a statement of compliance with U.S. law and DEA regulations--allowing consumers to know which pharmacies are safe and which are not; clarify that rogue pharmacies that sell drugs over the Internet will face the same penalties as people who illegally sell the same drugs on the street; increase the Federal penalties for illegally distributing  controlled substances;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>create a new Federal cause of action that would allow a State attorney general to shut down a rogue Web site selling controlled substances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a critical first step in stemming the tide of online drug trafficking and prescription drug abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I want to share the story of this bill's namesake, Ryan T. Haight. Ryan was an 18-year-old honor student from La Mesa, California, when he died in his home on February 12, 2001. His parents found a bottle of Vicodin in his room with a label from an out-of-State pharmacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It turns out that Ryan had been ordering addictive drugs online and paying with a debit card his parents gave him to buy baseball cards on eBay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a physical exam or his parents' consent, Ryan had been obtaining controlled substances, some from an Internet site in Oklahoma. It only took a few months before Ryan's life was ended by an overdose on a cocktail of painkillers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ryan's story is just one of many. Rogue Internet pharmacies are making it increasingly easy for teens like Ryan to access deadly prescription drugs. This bill is the first step to stem that terrible tide. It creates sensible requirements for Internet pharmacy Web sites that will not impact access to convenient, oftentimes cost-saving drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for rising up and passing this important bill.</paragraph>
