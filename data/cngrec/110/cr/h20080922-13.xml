    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the title of my 1-minute is called "Taxpayers Sacrifice All and Receive Nothing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The plan that developed this weekend for a comprehensive bailout of private sector financial institutions put taxpayers at risk with little or no benefit to those who pay the taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This plan will put taxpayers at a risk for losses that belong to those companies that recklessly sought profits, profits for the stockholders and executives through dividends, salaries, bonuses and presumed stock appreciation. Instead, taxpayers who assume this risk should also enjoy an equity premium that goes beyond the return of their funds with interest for this bailout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The taxpayers, after being awarded interest from their funds, as if they had invested in bonds, should have warrants as an equity kicker to sweeten their deal, giving them premium for their risk. Any institutional lender would demand as much and more. In this way, the taxpayers could share in the upside success of the companies that they rescue.</paragraph>
