    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will recess shortly for a joint meeting to hear an address from the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the recess order be changed--it now has us reconvening at 12:15 p.m.--to subject to the call of the Chair. That way, if it doesn't work out exactly at 12:15 p.m., no one will be disadvantaged.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when we reconvene, we will go right to work on the Labor-HHS-VA appropriations conference report under the parameters of the agreement entered last night. In addition, the Senate also may consider the WRDA conference report after disposition of the Labor-HHS conference report. Members can expect rollcall votes during the day. We will also, of course, be on the farm bill, interspersed through all the other work we are doing. Hopefully, at the end of the day, we can work  something out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a conversation with the distinguished Republican leader last night. There may be something we can work out on the amendments. I note for the record, as I explained to my Republican counterpart last night, there was conversation on the floor yesterday that the last time the farm bill came up, Senator Daschle was the leader. At that time, there were 16 or 19 amendments, but they were all relevant amendments, with the exception of one from Senator Kyl of Arizona which was a sense-of-the-Senate  amendment dealing with the estate tax. Other than that, they were all relevant to the farm bill. That is the way it has been. We went back and checked, and that is the way it has been for very many farm bills. That is what we should do on this farm bill, as I have suggested. But we can work something out with the minority and come up with a list of amendments. I will be happy to do that if that is something which will make them happy.</paragraph>
