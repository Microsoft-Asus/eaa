    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express concern that serious violations of the law appear to be occurring and should be aggressively pursued by the IRS and, in turn, prosecuted by the Department of Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, numerous Internet gambling websites may be violating statutes such as 26 U.S.C. 4401 et seq. Section 4401 requires an excise tax equal to 2 percent of the amount of unauthorized wagers. Section 4404 makes clear that the tax applies to wagers "placed by a person who is in the United States with a person who is a citizen or resident of the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the indictment in United States v. BETonSPORTS.COM and the inclusion of tax evasion charges in counts 14, 15, and 16.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These counts charge that the defendants attempted to "evade and defeat the ..... wagering excise tax" in three ways: (1) by failing to make any wagering excise tax returns on or before the last day of the month following the month the wagers were accepted, as required by law, to any proper officer of the Internal Revenue Service, (2) by failing to pay to the Internal Revenue Service said wagering excise tax, and (3) by directing that the wagering funds be sent outside the United States--all  in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7201, and Title 18, United States Code, Section 2.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly support the decision of the Department of Justice to enforce the wagering excise tax and pursue any persons in violation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, it is important to note that extremely large sums of money are at issue: count 14 charges that from January 29, 2001 to on or about February 3, 2002, the sum of approximately $1,094,669,000.00 in taxable wagers were had and received; count 15 charges that from February 4, 2002 to on or about February 2, 2003, the sum of approximately $1,228,874,000.00 in taxable wagers were had and received; and count 16 charges that from February 3, 2003 to on or about February 1, 2004, the sum</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to point out that significant income taxes and excise taxes appear to be owed by numerous persons. Collecting these amounts would be an important component of the Administration's efforts to address the "tax gap."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, with such large sums at issue, the IRS and the Department of Justice should see if money laundering is involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Department has expressed strong concern that Internet gambling operations could be used not only for tax evasion, but also for other criminal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Internet gambling is particularly well-suited for the laying and integration stages of money laundering, in which launderers attempt to disguise the nature or ownership of the proceeds by concealing or blending transactions within the mass of apparently legitimate transactions. Due in large measure to the volume and speed of transactions, as well as the virtual anonymity offered by the Internet, offshore gambling websites are an area of considerable money laundering concern. The Internet gambling  operations are, in essence, the functional equivalent of wholly unregulated offshore banks with the bettor accounts serving as bank accounts for account holders who are, in the virtual world, virtually anonymous. For these reasons, Internet gambling operations are vulnerable to be used, not only for money laundering, but also for criminal activities ranging from terrorist financing to tax evasion. (State Department, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, released March 2004.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Justice has echoed these concerns. At a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, John G. Malcolm, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, testified:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another major concern that the Department of Justice has about on-line gambling is that Internet gambling businesses provide criminals with an easy and excellent vehicle for money laundering, due in large part to the volume, speed, and international reach of Internet transactions and the offshore locations of most Internet gambling sites, as well as the fact that the industry itself is already cash-intensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fact that money launderers have to go to financial institutions either to conceal their illegal funds or recycle those funds back into the economy for their use. Because criminals are aware that banks have been subjected to greater scrutiny and regulation, they have--not surprisingly--turned to other non-bank financial institutions, such as casinos, to launder their money. On-line casinos are a particularly inviting target because, in addition to using the gambling that casinos offer  as a way to hide or transfer money, casinos offer a broad array of financial services to their customers, such as providing credit accounts, fund transmittal services, check cashing services, and currency exchange services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individuals wanting to launder ill-gotten gains through an on-line casino can do so in a variety of ways. For example, a customer could establish an account with a casino using illegally-derived proceeds, conduct a minimal amount of betting or engage in offsetting bets with an overseas confederate, and then request repayment from the casino, thereby providing a new "source" of the funds. If a gambler wants to transfer money to an inside source in the casino, who may be located in another country,  he can just play until he loses the requisite amount. Similarly, if an insider wants to transfer money to the gambler, perhaps as payment for some illicit activity, he can rig the game so the bettor wins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The anonymous nature of the Internet and the use of encryption make it difficult to trace the transactions. The gambling business may also not maintain the transaction records, in which case tracing may be impossible. While regulators in the United States can visit physical casinos, observe their operations, and examine their books and records to ensure compliance with regulations, this is far more difficult, if not impossible, with virtual casinos. (John G. Malcolm, Deputy Assistant Attorney  General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice, March 18, 2003.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, there should be strong enforcement efforts to ensure that Internet gambling entities are not violating the law.</paragraph>
