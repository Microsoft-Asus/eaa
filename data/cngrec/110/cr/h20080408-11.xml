    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to take this time to congratulate the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina on their 16th anniversary of independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor for me to represent the largest Bosnian-American population in the United States, as well as cochair the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Bosnia with Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey. Our Bosnian-American neighbors who have come to St. Louis and the other parts of the U.S. have contributed a great deal to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that on April 7, 1992, the United States was one of the first nations to recognize the newly independent Bosnia-Herzegovina. As we honor the anniversary of their independence today, let us reaffirm our support for Bosnia's progress toward Euro-Atlantic integration and remember their long history of multi-ethnic and religious tolerance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to applaud their democratic orientation, and strongly encourage the further strengthening of government reforms with respect to human rights, rule of law and free market economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I once again congratulate the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the anniversary of their independence, and I look forward to further collaboration between our two countries.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
