COMMUNITY FORESTS AND OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION PROGRAM.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The United States Forest Service projects that 44 million acres of privately owned forested land will be developed in the United States by 2030, including many of the most important remaining forested parcels within and adjacent to communities.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) There is an urgent need to assist local governments in raising the funds necessary to purchase the most important of these parcels of privately owned forested land as they come up for sale.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The breakup of forested land into smaller parcels has resulted in an increasing number of owners of privately owned forested land, but many of these owners have little or no experience in forest stewardship.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) In fast growing communities of all sizes across the United States, the remaining parcels of privately owned forested land play an essential role in protecting public water supplies, which has lead many local governments to purchase these lands for municipal or county ownership.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Rising rates of obesity and other public health problems related to inactivity have been shown to be ameliorated by improving public access to safe and pleasing areas for outdoor recreation, which has lead many local governments to purchase lands for recreational purposes under municipal or county ownership.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Across the United States, many communities of diverse types and sizes are deriving significant financial benefit from owning and managing municipal or county forestlands as a source of local revenue that also contributes significantly to the health of the forest products economy at the local and national levels.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The access to privately owned forested land for hunting, fishing, and trapping has declined, and the number of persons participating in these activities has likewise declined, as these lands are divided into smaller parcels and more owners of privately owned forested land post their land against public use, which has lead many local governments to purchase forestlands to guarantee access for hunting, fishing, and trapping.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) There is a national interest and an urgent need to assist local governments in raising the funds necessary to purchase important privately owned forested land that will maintain the diverse public benefits of forestlands close to or within all manner of communities nationwide, from close-knit rural communities to fast growing suburban and exurban areas.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Establishment of Program.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"SEC. 21.

  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this farm bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation before this Congress in this session because it truly does affect us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It affects our family farmers. It affects consumers in America. It affects our wildlife and natural resources. It affects people who are hungry, both in this country and abroad, and it affects economic development opportunities in rural America but also in the developing world, and it affects my home State in Wisconsin, where agriculture is still the number one industry. I know, I have a 200-acre farm in western Wisconsin where we rotate corn and soybeans. I've got beef cattle on it from time  to time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for too long farm policy has resulted in billions of dollars of subsidies going to a few, but very large and very wealthy entities who then gobble up family farms around them, drive up land values and make it virtually impossible for new beginning farmers to enter the business. These subsidies have distorted the marketplace, and they distort our trade policies. Too many farmers have planted for the government paycheck instead of the marketplace. This has got to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But instead of heeding the call for reasonable, justifiable reform in light of current market prices, the farm bill before us fails to even make token reforms under the Title I commodity programs. In fact, they still allow taxpayer-supported subsidies to go to individuals in this country with an adjusted gross income of $1 million. Over the next 5 years, there will be $26 billion in direct subsidy payments going out to commodity producers who are getting at or near record prices in the marketplace.  And under these direct payments, the committee raises the cap from $40,000 to $60,000 and allows multiple entities on the same farm to collect the same type of subsidies. It also eliminates the cap with the loan deficiency program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a missed opportunity. In fact, what we have before us today is a bipartisan, fair, reform amendment that takes light of the market conditions and offers reasonable and justifiable reforms under a very simple proposition: Let's give our family farmers help when they need it; let's not when they don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we propose in our amendment would be phasing out these direct payments that were meant to be temporary in the 1996 farm bill, and now we're in the third farm bill, and they're increasing these subsidy payments and lifting the caps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also replace the current countercyclical program with a true safety net, a revenue-based safety net that even the corn growers have been working on as a replacement over the last few years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also place a tighter income limit at $250,000 adjusted gross, even slightly above the administration's own $200,000 limit that they recommend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plus, we call for long-overdue reform with the crop insurance program based on the good work that our friends Mr. Cooper and Mr. Waxman have been doing in this, and we all do this under justifiable market conditions, ending up with a farm bill at the end of the day that does not distort our market, nor our trade policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long family farmers have suffered due to the inequities of this farm bill, and with the savings that we use to reform the Title I programs, we make significant new investments in other priority areas. We have a $6 billion increase in funding under the nutrition title to deal with hunger in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a $3 billion increase of voluntary incentive conservation programs, when today three out of every four farmers applying for conservation funding assistance are turned away because of inadequacy of funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a $1.2 billion increase for specialty crops above what the committee did, and a healthy food program to combat the obesity epidemic which is ravishing our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also have $1.1 billion in guaranteed funding out of the McGovern-Dole bill and $500 million for minority and disadvantaged farmers, $200 million increase for rural development to create economic job opportunities throughout rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at the end of the reform, we even have money for deficit reduction. How refreshing that we may have a bill coming out of this Congress that actually reforms enough to have some left over to reduce the massive budget deficits and prepare for the aging of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's really nice about this is it is all paid for. We don't have to go to the Ways and Means Committee or the Financial Services Committee to seek offsets in order to pay for these other priorities and still provide a safety net for our family farmers. This amendment gets us out of the box that my Republican friends find themselves in in not being able to support a tax increase to finance this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And you guys are exactly right. If you had been pulling this on us while we were in the minority, we would be raising bloody hell as well, because if you lose the process in the place, you lose a sense of fairness, and if you don't have fairness at the end of the day, you can't get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're saying we don't have to go down that road. Let's make some commonsense reforms to find the offsets to deal with the other priorities while still maintaining a proper safety net so when the farmers are in trouble, if market prices plummet, there will be a safety net for them; but let's not do it when they don't need it, so we can go home and look the taxpayers in the eyes and justify exactly what we're doing here.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SANDLIN, HERSETH" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong opposition to this amendment because it eviscerates the safety net for my constituents and destroys the delicate balance achieved in the committee bill which reflects significant and meaningful reform and is supported by the broadest coalition of stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the bill has been unfairly characterized by the gentleman from Wisconsin in a number of ways, but just as one example, how can there be no reform in the commodity title when in this bill, the committee bill, there's a 43 percent reduction in the commodity title and a 32.3 percent increase in the commodity title?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if you don't believe me, consider who has endorsed this amendment offered by Mr. Kind and Mr. Flake: Club for Growth, long advocated to eliminate farm payment programs and destroy the safety net; and the Bush administration, who long opposed disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers devastated by natural disaster, long opposed the mandatory country of origin labeling program. Both Club for Growth and the Bush administration prioritize multinational corporations' international  trading interests just like the administration is now supporting foreign companies who avoid paying U.S. taxes over my constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me just say before yielding to the gentleman from Wisconsin, the drop in 40 percent that is claimed by the committee is actually taking credit for high prices of corn and other commodities. There's no cut at all. So this is not reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment for a number of reasons. Number one, it's high time we reform our agricultural programs which are Depression-era. This is a modest amendment from the original aggressive reforms. It puts in place the reforms that the USDA experts said that we ought to put in place for the safety net.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just address what the safety net really is. Should we or should we not give million-dollar checks to farmers making $1 million? Should we have a farm program that helps the family farmer at a time when they're struggling? Should those payments go to farmers when they're making record high prices, when they're doing well? Or should these programs go to them when they're hurting? That's what this amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also pays for itself; no budget gimmicks, no timing shift, no tax increases. It actually reduces the deficit by $2 billion in 5 years and $14 billion over 10. It actually boosts conservation. It actually boosts nutrition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just address the payment limit. This bill right here says we will allow farmers to have aggregate program payments that are at least 12 times the poverty rate. Isn't that high enough? The average poverty rate for a family of four is $20,500. This amendment says let's allow the farm payment to a family of four be as high as a quarter of a million dollars. Yet the committee's bill says, no, that's not good enough. It has to be unlimited in some senses or a million-dollar AGI for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let's get our priorities straight. Lets have a farm bill that doesn't distort our trade posture in the international community. If we pass the base bill, it hurts us internationally to get better trade agreements and open markets for our farmers. If we pass the base bill, it hurts us from helping people in the developing world lift their lives out of poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you vote for the Kind-Flake amendment, you will help us internationally open markets to farmers, you will preserve a modern safety net that helps farmers when they need it and the family farmers when they need it, and you will save money for the taxpayer, you will put savings in nutrition, you will put savings in conservation, and you will help reduce the deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a responsible amendment. It's a responsible bill. It is the right way forward, and this is what really, truly, needy family farms need. We don't need to be cutting checks in the seven-figure range for people with AGIs, adjusted gross incomes, of $1 million. We need to say 12 times the poverty rate's enough. That's what we need to say, and by voting for this amendment, that's what we are saying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Help the family farmer, help conservation, help nutrition and reduce the deficit. Vote for this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I'll say one good thing about this amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin and the gentleman from Arizona: It doesn't raise taxes. But I'll say nothing else good about it because it rips the safety net out from under America's farmers and ranchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Agriculture Committee bill is the result of careful consideration. The committee reviewed many options and took the testimony of countless witnesses at hearings in Washington and in multiple States. The committee chose to maintain a safety net that has proven very effective since 2002, but it's done so with reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee included in the safety net the option for producers to choose a priority of the administration, a revenue-based, countercyclical program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee also drastically modified rules related to payment limits and income levels for participation. No one with a 3-year average gross adjusted income over $1 million may participate in the commodity program. That is down from $2.5 million for producers with AGI between $500,000 and $1 million; 66 2/3  percent of their income must come from agriculture. These are major changes from the 2002 farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the committee has done away with the three-entity rule. Now producers can receive payments on only one business entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee made significant reforms. By cutting $16 billion over 5  years, a 40 percent cut, this amendment shatters the farm safety net. This amendment cuts the safety net provided by direct payments by about $11 billion over 5 years, or 42 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment cuts the most basic level of support for farmers and ranchers, the marketing assistance loan, by $2 billion over 5 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee was able to make significant increases in conservation, nutrition, rural development, research, fruits and vegetables, and in other areas without ripping out the safety net from America's farmers and ranchers, but the Kind-Flake-Ryan-Blumenauer amendment makes increases in those areas at the expense of American farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee's commitment to conservation is unquestionable. The committee-passed bill increases conservation spending by over $4 billion over the next 5 years. We added over $1.9 billion to environmental quality incentive programs, which helps farmers and ranchers comply with State, Federal and local environmental laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also continued our commitment to highly erodible land, wetlands, grasslands and wildlife habitat by funding the Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetland Reserve Program, the Grasslands Reserve Program, and the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee increased the commitment to preserving working farms by increasing funding to the Farmland Ranchland Protection Program by almost 300 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee also focused efforts to help producers such as specialty crop and livestock producers who do not participate in traditional commodity programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We took an unprecedented step of committing $150 million over the next 5 years to help clean up the rivers of the Chesapeake Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not need this amendment. Oppose it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, just to give you an indication of how effective the current safety net is, it was recently discovered there was $1.1 billion in subsidy payments that went out to farmers who had already passed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to recognize for 2 minutes a champion of family farmers and an advocate for reasonable, justifiable reform, my friend from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. I appreciate his leadership. Along with our friend from Arizona and from Wisconsin, we have before you a real opportunity to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my heart goes out to the committee. They had a tough job. They went, I think, as far as they could, given the dynamics they had. Some of the things they did I strongly support and, in fact, have worked for. Those good items are now all protected under our initiative. In fact, many of them are actually enhanced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They are enhanced not by throwing money at it, but by actually having real reform; not talking about reform, not moving towards reform, but actually doing it. Our bipartisan amendment is paid for, and it does so by helping most farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My State of Oregon is an example. Under this initiative, we will gain more than $140 million in every congressional district over the life of this effort. We do this not by new taxes and new programs; we change the dynamic. No longer will 80 percent of America's farmers and ranchers get little or nothing. No longer will we have, in this case, a sham, I'm sorry to say, payment limitation that will only affect one-tenth of a percent of America's farmers, those who are at $1 million, it will only  save $45 million, which shows you that it doesn't have much impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say that any farmer who can't get their adjusted gross income under $1 million probably needs to look for a new CPA, not a new subsidy. We stop the lunacy in a time of record high corn prices. We are going to give them 10 more billion dollars. If we don't give them 10 more billion dollars in a time of record high corn prices, we are going to shred the safety net? I would argue, not. Have a real limit, help the budget, and, most important, help America's family farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pass this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Kind-Flake amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sponsors of this amendment like to argue that passage of the amendment would help pave the way for new trade agreements. That is naive thinking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our trade negotiators are engaged in WTO trade talks in a bid to open up foreign markets for U.S. agriculture products and reduce, if not eliminate, trade distorting foreign subsides. The cuts in the farm safety net that the Kind-Flake amendment impose are tantamount to unilateral disarmament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Cold War, we would never have cut our military strength without first extracting similar if not greater reductions from the Soviets. We should do no less in today's trade negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cutting our farm support will not lead to a WTO agreement. As the current negotiations have shown, any time the United States gives a little on its trade position, our trading partners ask us to give more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trying to create a farm bill that will please a WTO negotiator from another country is the wrong approach. The farm bill is for helping U.S. farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who supports the Kind-Flake amendment, groups who mistakenly believe that unilateral cuts will spark a trade deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who opposes the Kind-Flake amendment, farm and commodity groups across the nation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to thank you and the ranking member and the members of the committee for the hard work on a bipartisan basis that really produced, I think, a good product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I have to rise against the Kind amendment, not because it does involve reform, but I think it involves reform in a way that uses a meat ax and does not provide transition for American farmers, something I think I know something about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, I represent a third-generation farm family that has been farming in the San Joaquin Valley since the turn of the 19th, early 20th century. What this bill does, what this amendment does, if it were to be enacted, is not provide the level of nutrition or research and competitiveness for food safety and conservation that the underlying bill has, which is why I support the underlying bill, because it provides real reform. It provides nutrition. It provides the efforts to make American farmers  more competitive on a global basis with global markets, provides reform in a host of areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, I urge that you vote for the underlying bill. Vote against the Kind amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me just say that the direct payments were never intended as a safety net. They were meant to wean farmers off of the dole. If our parents worked as hard as this committee in weaning their children, we would all still be living in our parents' basement. It doesn't work to continue and continue and continue on with this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to thank our colleagues for their crusade in offering real reform for the American people. I am proud to be a part of this unique coalition of Members in support of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is a Member representing a suburban area of Seattle taking such an interest in the farm bill? The farm bill isn't just for farmers. It's funded by and affects every one of us across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill leaves American farmers and businesses open to challenges from the World Trade Organization. Trade is critical, crucial to our State and our farmers. One in three jobs in Washington State is linked to trade. This amendment is a critical  step to bringing us into trade compliance so that our farmers and businesses have access to markets around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, 19 congressional districts receive 50 percent of Federal farm subsidies; 348 congressional districts would benefit positively from this amendment. Every district in my State would benefit. The Washington Post referred to farm subsidies as Federal giveaways that cost all Americans but benefit few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment funds many other American priorities; $1.2 billion to promote healthy food choices, $3 billion more to conservation programs, and $1 billion more to support fruit and vegetable producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment saves money, brings us closer to trade compliance. It does all this without raising taxes. In fact, it saves taxpayers $2 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't continue business as usual. Our taxpayers deserve an equitable balance. The time is now for reform.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400247" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Kind amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, I believe, is a threat to producers, consumers and rural America. We must do everything we can to defeat this amendment. The amendment destroys the commodity title, in essence, as we know it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know it's not as strong as the language they started out with a few days ago, but it starts us down that trail. By cutting the direct payments by 42 percent, by completely revealing, in effect, the counter-cyclical program, this is completely unacceptable and would do more harm to production agriculture than anything I can think of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in agriculture understand that the commodity title is much more than just producers. It's about providing the American consumer with the highest quality, the safest supply of food and fiber in the history of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have done that. In fact, we in the United States have the most affordable food supply in the world. We Americans spend 10 percent of our disposable income on food, while other countries spend as much as 51 percent on their food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is no accident. This is because we have created sound agricultural policy over the last 75 years. We have had 10 good years of agriculture policy in particular. We need to continue to build on that. If we can't, well, if we gut the foundation that we have created in past farm bills, then ultimately not only will rural America suffer for this, the American consumer will suffer for this, with higher prices, instability in supply, and that role that we have occupied for a century as the grainery,  the reserve food stock for the world, will be gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, I believe, my colleagues are sincere in what they do. But sometimes sincerity does not generate clear, thoughtful, practical policy. Reject their version of sincerity. Let's focus on the policy that has delivered so much to the American consumer and rural America.</paragraph>

It didn't. In fact, in many ways it made matters worse. I don't think we can wait another 5 years before we have fundamental reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that back in the 1930s, 25 percent of our population lived on farms. Today it's less than 2 percent. Today, corn, cotton, wheat, rice and soybeans count for 90 percent of our government commodity payments, and yet it leaves fruits and vegetables, which represent two-thirds of farm sales, ineligible for support. The largest farms that comprise only 3 percent of the total farms get the vast majority of crop subsidies today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It just seems to me that it's time for fundamental reform that more fairly distributes the benefits of this program to all of America's deserving farms and families. That's why I support the Kind amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Kind amendment and in opposition to any amendment trying to destroy the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My family still farms the same land that my ancestors settled back 150 years ago. As one of only a few ranchers and farmers in Congress, I know a thing or two about agriculture. The farm bill provides a much-deserved safety net for our farmers, but it also provides a much-needed safety net for American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this bumper sticker it says "Not everyone farms, but everyone eats." The Kind amendment will make it even more difficult for our Nation's farmers and ranchers to stay in business, forcing us to rely on foreign production to feed our growing Nation. Do you really want to rely on other countries to produce our food? Look at the trouble we have gotten into for relying on other countries for the oil that we need. I, for one, would not want to buy or feed my children food harvested in China.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise tonight as one who typically comes to this floor to champion the cause of fiscal conservatism. But tonight, perhaps more importantly, I come here as the grandson of a farmer. I come here as the son of a farmer. I come here as one who grew up working on the family farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have looked at the work of Mr. Flake and Mr. Kind, and I believe that this amendment is the one that is best for agriculture, and I think it is the one that is best for taxpayers. I don't like everything in this amendment. There is a lot I don't like about it. But I have got to ask myself, does it take me in a direction I want to go or does it take me in a direction I don't want to go? I think this work takes me in the direction I want to go, because it provides real reform.  If you have got a program that's costing taxpayers $20 billion a year, maybe you need some reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If 10 percent of the recipients are receiving 33 percent of the egg, maybe you need some reform. If most of the subsidies are going to commercial farmers that have average incomes above $200,000, maybe you need some real reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very importantly, for the agriculture producers in the Fifth District of Texas, our future is in exports. We want to export good Texas beef, and I'm afraid the committee bill is going to hurt trade. It will hurt trade.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I stand in strong opposition to the Kind-Flake amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are looking at a time where we have concerns about trade. We have to realize that cutting direct payments raids our most WTO-compliant and nondistorting mechanism that stabilizes the United States agriculture and rural economies. These direct payments are decoupled from production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people don't know this, but they do not encourage overproduction. This amendment would weaken us in our position in trade negotiations through a unilateral disarmament on agriculture policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really believe that this threatens the long-term viability and competitiveness of U.S. agriculture in a global marketplace still characterized by subsidized foreign competition and continued trade barriers. In rural America, this would reduce our land values, our tax base, and cause potential disruptions and collateral for our farm loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately, we would see farm equity disappear. The Americans have expectations of a safe, affordable food supply. Oppose the Kind-Flake amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, for anyone interested in reforming crop insurance, there are two ways to do it tonight. This way through comprehensive agriculture reform, the Kind amendment, is probably the best way to do it. But there will be another way to do it later on. We need to reform crop insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone who has studied it realizes it. The question is when. I suggest the time is now, because there are literally billions of dollars of corporate welfare we can and must be saving starting tonight. These 16 companies, there are only 16 companies, made $2.8 billion, at taxpayer expense, profit in the last 5 years. It's an outrageous system once you look into it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GAO and others discovered that 40 cents of every dollar that is supposed to go to the farmer, in fact, goes to the insurance middleman. This is not right. We need to get more money to the farmers, not less. Let's reform the crop insurance system. The Kind amendment is the right way to do it. Another way to do it will be the Cooper amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as a freshman Member of this Congress and someone who until this past January had never held political office, I came to Washington determined to change the culture of this august body. I believed that we could work together and, in doing so, put the interests of the American people over the political interests of party or the special interests of powerful lobbyists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few days ago at a press conference, I proudly stood and thanked my Republican colleagues in supporting a bill that clearly was a victory for American agriculture. It was a victory for our growers and ranchers; it was a victory for the people of Okeechobee, Lake Placid, Moore Haven, and Clewiston, Florida. This morning I awoke and found out that my Republican colleagues had changed their minds because the President of the United States again wanted to play politics. This is not about a  tax increase. This is about politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a businessman who, for 30 years, ran businesses around the globe, I am incensed that my colleagues would hurt the American farmer by lying to the American people and call closing a tax loophole for foreign companies and giving them an unfair advantage over our own businesses a tax increase. But silly me, why should I have been surprised? They are the party of special interests, Halliburton, Big Oil, and now they are the party of big foreign corporations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to tell the gentleman from Florida this is the party of American jobs, of American investment, of American workers. And we are going to protect that by not supporting tax increases that will cause a disincentive for investment in this country, that will cost jobs, that will involve the violation of American treaties, and will cause retaliation in foreign countries where we will face increased taxes on American investment there as well.  This is a tax increase, pure and simple, and that is why we will not turn our backs on the American people and their jobs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise tonight in strong opposition to the Kind amendment. The Kind amendment may be kind to someone, but it is not to American farm families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, what is happening in America today is that we have already asked American farm families to make a reduction. Mr. Kind wants to reduce farm payments 40 percent. Well, that is on top of the 50 percent that they have already been reduced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For America to be competitive in the global marketplace, farmers and ranchers all across America have had to get larger. To be competing in this global economy, the efficiencies of running $150,000 farm machinery across small acreages is no longer feasible. And yet what Mr. Kind and his friends want to do is to make American agriculture not competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, to be competitive in this world, you have to find economic efficiencies, and these efficiencies have meant that many producers have had to get larger. And as they are trying to compete in a global marketplace where in many cases they are locked out because of trade restraints in these other countries, now we want to say to the American ranchers and farmers: Don't be efficient. Don't be competitive in this global marketplace. We want to take away the ability for you to be sustained in  a global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not good policy for any business. We don't do that in any other area of our government today. We don't say to American companies, why don't you all get small and inefficient? We don't tell them to do that. We say, get strong and efficient. And yet the Kind amendment wants to say to American farmers don't be efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge members not to support the Kind amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Kind amendment. This amendment will reduce the safety net for U.S. farmers and result in a less secure and more expensive food supply for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a lot of discussion about the need for "reform" in farm programs. I suggest the so-called reformers out there get better acquainted with the facts:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the portion of spending in the 2007 Farm Bill that goes to farm commodity programs has declined by half, to 14 percent of the spending in the bill. In the 2002 Farm Bill, the share of spending for commodities was 28 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, in 2002, commodity programs were projected to cost $94 billion over 5 years. As the 2002 Farm Bill comes to a close, actual spending will come in $21 billion less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, because spending has been lower and is projected to stay low, the cost projection for the next 10 years for farm commodity programs is down nearly $60 billion compared to 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Farm programs have worked as intended, providing support when prices are low and pulling back when prices are high, as most currently are. Maintaining the farm safety net has a reasonable cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Farm programs are the only area in <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill> in which spending is down. On top of these reductions, the Ag Committee took the additional step of reforming farm program payment policies and crop Insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kind amendment doesn't save any money. It simply puts what it cuts from farm programs into expanding other spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A final reason for not cutting these programs off: maintaining U.S. leverage in trade negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. farmers' and ranchers' exports are currently shut out of markets around the world. Without a significant market access agreement in the WTO Doha round negotiations, U.S. producers will continue to be at a disadvantage. The only leverage our negotiators have to gain new market access is to offer to change farm programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress unilaterally reduces farm programs through the Kind amendment, our negotiators' efforts to gain market access are completely undercut and will be ineffective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Support U.S. farmers and consumers and oppose the Kind amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>The Kind-Flake Fairness in Farm and Food Policy amendment is one of the most remarkable developments in this Congress in years. This is real bipartisan reform in a major area of our government, agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Republican I have been astonished with the absolute fixation my own party has had on the Depression-era price-guarantee program. As an observer of Democrats, I have been astonished with their willingness to support a big-business-favored program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kind-Flake substitute brings us into the modern age. It helps farmers, it helps consumers, it helps taxpayers. I am so proud to have the opportunity to speak in favor of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan amendment would replace depression-era price guarantees with a modern revenue-based safety net developed by Department of Agriculture (USDA) experts that better protects family farmers from declines in crop prices and crop yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also reforms our government-subsidized crop insurance program to fairly share the costs and risks of this program with crop insurance agents and companies, and gradually reduce direct payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment invests some of these savings in new conservation, nutrition and specialty crop and minority farmer priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The remaining savings are dedicated to deficit reduction of $2 billion over five years, and at least $10 billion over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A unique coalition of members and advocacy groups from both sides of the aisle have united to advocate for these reforms to commodity programs to make them more equitable and geared toward family farms instead of a very few large and wealthy entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, we need new farm and food policies, and we have it in this Kind/Flake fairness in Form &amp; Food Policy Amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this Fairness Amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I recognize myself for 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This so-called reform bill, we just got the CBO score. First of all, it changes the payment limits based on the 2002 bill. So, the effect of this bill is to have no limitation on payments at all, number one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are writing a 10-year baseline, not a 5-year bill. This bill cuts conservation 37 1/2  percent below our baseline over 10 years. It actually takes less out of crop insurance by 13.5 percent compared to our bill over 10 years. And this is what happens when people aren't on the Agriculture Committee and get involved in this very complex area. If this is a reform bill, if this is freedom to farm, we would have a heck of a mess in farm country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we just got this score. We wish we could have got this out earlier. We got it about 2 hours ago, and I just want people to know what this bill actually does. It does not do what some people have been saying.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Arizona. I support his amendment because it does bring both fairness to the American farmer and also to the American taxpayer, and it does so by dispelling certain myths that are out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program started in 1933 as an emergency program that was supposed to be temporary. Well, 70, 80 years later and this temporary program is still with us. It started out as a program that was supposed to be for the small farmers, like we have in the State of New Jersey still, actually, and yet we find that three-quarters of the farmers are getting 10 percent of the program. The small farmers are just getting a slice of it. It is supposed to be going out for the small farmers and the farmers  who are only making a small income, to help the family farm, yet we see that the average income of these farmers for the large sales are making $199,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment helps to dispel the myth to make sure that we get a program that actually helps the family farmer and helps the American taxpayer at the same time. I support the amendment of the gentleman from Arizona.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This speaks to the fallacy of coming to this body tonight with a policy that is as broad and important for America as farm policy and to try to fix it with 20 minutes of debate on each side. It is just nonsense. This did not go through any hearings. We had field hearings, we had committee hearings, we had testimony from experts, we had testimony from producers throughout this process. And while that may have come to a result they don't like, it at least came to a result that has broad support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This process that they are bringing to us tonight should be subjected to the same scrutiny, to the same opportunity to look at what it does and what it does not do that all of the farm bill that we are looking at tonight does.

    <paragraph>Let me just pay tribute first to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) for the hard work in bringing this amendment and being the lead sponsor to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It strikes me that the committee in this case, as the saying goes, is traipsing down a flower-strewn path unpricked by the thorns of reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are running headlong, whether we like it or not, into international trade agreements that will not coexist with the status quo bill. We cannot move forward and maintain the access we have to world markets or increase access to other world markets with this bill. We simply can't. Nor can we maintain the fiscal burden carrying this forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a real reform bill, a reform bill that really looks out for family farms, as opposed to protecting those who are gobbling up family farms. That is what this reform bill is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of this body have wanted an opportunity to vote for a bill that doesn't increase taxes, that has real reform. This is that chance. This is the amendment. This is the chance to actually do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need real reform, reform that allows us to go forward, that allows the American farmer to actually become independent and independently competitive globally. The status quo bill, the committee bill, just doesn't do that. It doesn't cut direct payments. As much as we have heard that tonight, it doesn't. High prices have done that. There is no cut in direct payments at all here. Only prices have done that.</paragraph>

The people in Kansas certainly are not happy that this has been allowed to go on for year after year.

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Kind amendment, and I do so on behalf of the farmers of Ohio's 18th Congressional District. They are a very diverse bunch, but one thing they all have in common is that they are small, family-run operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They asked for several things in this farm bill: conservation, energy, and a safety net. This bill as it has come out of committee provides those things that will allow those farmers to continue to do business.

    <paragraph>I was really surprised to hear my colleague, Mr. Flake, say, in talking about his bill, that farmers participating in the farm program are something like grown children living in the parents' basement. What a complete affront to the hardworking family farmers producing our Nation's food all across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also shows a profound ignorance in just what's involved in family farming, tremendous capital exposed every year you put that crop and risks you can't control, price collapse, crop failure. And the only thing that's going to keep family farmers as our backbone for U.S. food production is a farm program that helps allay these risks.</paragraph>

I should know. I used to serve on the committee. And I'm not being critical. That's just a fact. They have their districts to represent as we have districts to represent as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>By shifting from obsolete programs the Kind amendment provides an additional $1.2 billion above the committee bill for fruit and vegetable growers--tripling the Farmer Market Promotion Program, making $500 million mandatory for Specialty Crop Research, making $150 million mandatory for Community Food Projects, and providing hundreds of millions of dollars for community supported agriculture, and the School Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to emphasize that the Kind amendment would provide $3 billion more than the committee bill to conservation programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Support for the Kind amendment is broad and diverse including environmental and conservation groups, nutrition groups and groups that serve low-income Americans, specialty crop and organic farmers, and taxpayer groups. This is a sensible amendment. Indeed, the proposal by Mr. Kind, the gentleman from Wisconsin, is a remarkable, admirable legislative reform. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400030" topic="THE TERM `ENTITY' MEANS.--">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Kind-Flake amendment, and in support of <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the Kind-Flake amendment is nothing more than a veiled attempt at pulling the rug out from underneath of this nation's hardworking family farmers and those in the rural South who till the land of our nation to provide us with a safe, healthy, and robust food supply--often with little or no profit for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increasingly, we are relying on our farmers on many fronts--namely, to clothe, feed and, now, fuel our nation. The Kind-Flake amendment would divert us from reaching that goal by discouraging domestic crop production, dismantling our hope for energy innovation and independence, and increasing the trade deficit with countries that threaten our economic competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the Kind-Flake proposal would take away the farm safety net and put U.S. farmers and ranchers in unfair competition against heavily subsidized foreign producers, many of whom are protected by much higher import tariffs than those imposed by the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent months, we have heard horrific accounts of how agricultural products are grown and how food is manufactured abroad, especially in China, whose rapidly growing, already behemoth-sized economy now imports $2.26 billion worth of food into this country each year. Do we really want to reduce the incentive for our domestic producers to grow their own, and rely more from these foreign countries with proven histories of lax food safety standards and tendencies to include poisonous additives  into their products? I surely hope not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, in lowering the AGI limitation to $250,000, the Kind-Flake proposal is not drawn narrowly, as its supporters claim, but instead casts a wide net--it would eliminate over 38,000 current recipients from being covered by a farm safety net.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kind-Flake proposal also misrepresents itself by touting its revenue-based counter cyclical payments as revolutionary, and as a superior alternative to the traditional counter-cyclical program. This completely ignores the fact that the Agricultural Committee's markup includes a revenue based counter-cyclical payment option!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Agricultural Committee's proposal the producer gets to choose whether or not the current payment system or a revenue-based system is right for their unique operation. This allows individual producers to decide on their own what is best for their operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kind-Flake also cuts direct payments and, quite foolishly, assumes that by cutting direct payments, landowners will lower the price of rented land. In reality, cutting Direct Payments would leave farmers who rent land in a terrible lurch. It is highly unlikely that landowners will feel sympathetic to a producer and compelled to lower land rental rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of this debate is focused on cost--that agricultural subsidies are out of control, are disproportionate to the agricultural industry's value to United States GDP, but let's focus on the facts: U.S. farm policy today costs less than one half of one percent of the total federal budget and comprises just 13 percent of the total U.S. Department of Agriculture budget. I believe that proportionately small cost is well worth what is returned to the American people in terms of a safe, affordable  and robust food supply, a base on which to become energy independent, 20 percent of this nation's jobs, and $3.5 trillion in economic activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues offering this amendment today are misguided about rural interests, about rural America, and about the overall cost of a bill that is expected to keep U.S. farm policy costs low and be good for taxpayers.</paragraph>

POLLINATOR PROTECTION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the "Pollinator Protection Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) many of the crops that humans and livestock consume rely on pollinators for healthy growth;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) pollination by honey and native bees adds more than $18,000,000,000 annually to the value of United States crops;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3)  1/3  of the food supply of the United States depends on bee pollination, which makes the management and protection of pollinators an issue of paramount importance to the security of the United States food supply system;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) colony collapse disorder is the name that has been given to the latest die-off of honey bee colonies, exacerbating the continual decline of pollinators in North America;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) honey bee colonies in more than 23 states have been affected by colony collapse disorder;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) if the current rate of decline continues, the United States will be forced to rely more heavily on imported foods, which will destabilize the food security of the United States through adverse affects on the availability, price, and quality of the many fruits, vegetables, and other products that depend on animal pollination; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) enhanced funding for research on honey bees, native bees, parasites, pathogens, toxins, and other environmental factors affecting bees and pollination of cultivated and wild plants will result in methods of response to colony collapse disorder and other factors causing the decline of pollinators in North America.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Authorizations of Appropriations.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE.--There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Agricultural Research Service--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

COMMUNITY WOOD ENERGY PROGRAM.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.-- Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the United States' over-reliance on fossil fuel energy has placed undue strain on the nation by compromising our economy and national security;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) the United States' over-reliance on fossil fuel energy has also created new strains on our natural systems, including carbon emissions that contribute to climate change;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) transportation of energy, such as heating oil, adds to carbon emissions associated with meeting our community energy needs and therefore further feeds climate change;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) it is in the national interest to conserve energy and support adoption of new local, sustainable, efficient, and carbon neutral energy sources, such as wood energy, for community energy needs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) communities can save as much as 50 percent over natural gas, 80 percent over propane, 80 percent over electric heat, and 50 percent over oil heat by switching to wood energy for heating schools and other public buildings;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) in fast growing communities of all sizes across the United States, municipal and country-owned forest land is playing an essential role in meeting many public needs and could also be used to help support sustainable forestry and local wood energy applications; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the rapidly expanding base of private forest land owners nationwide includes many individuals with no experience in forest stewardship who could be given technical assistance to provide locally sourced wood supply through sustainable forest management for local wood energy applications.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide grants for community wood energy systems that are intended to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) meet community energy needs with reduced carbon intensity versus fossil fuel systems;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) promote energy conservation and development of new renewable energy sources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) aid local budgets by reducing municipal and county energy costs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) increase utilization of low value wood supplies and waste, thereby strengthening the forest products economy for the benefit of forest workers and private forest land owners; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) increase awareness of energy conservation and consumption and the multiple-use values of forests among community members, especially young people.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Grant Program.--The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Forest Service, shall establish a program to be known as the Community Wood Energy Program to provide grants to State and local governments to acquire community wood energy systems for public buildings and to implement a community wood energy plan.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (d) Use in Public Buildings.--A State or local government receiving a grant under subsection (c) shall use a community wood energy system acquired in whole or in part with the use of grant funds for primary use in a public facility owned by such State or local government.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (e) Limitation.--A community wood energy system acquired with grant funds provided under subsection (c) shall not exceed an output of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) 50,000,000 BTU per hour for heating; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) 2 megawatts for electric power production.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (f) Community Wood Energy Plan.--Within 18 months of receiving assistance under this section, communities shall utilize the technical assistance of the State forester to create a community wood energy plan identifying how local forests can be accessed in a sustainable manner to help meet the wood supply needs of systems purchased under this section.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (g) Matching Funds.--A State or local government receiving a grant under subsection (c) shall contribute an amount of non-Federal funds towards the acquisition of community wood energy systems that is at least equal to the amount of grant funds received by such State or local government.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (h) Community Wood Energy System Defined.--The term "community wood energy system" includes single facility central heating, district heating, combined heat and energy systems, and other related biomass energy systems that service schools, town halls, libraries, and other public buildings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) Appropriation.-- There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.</chair>
  <chair> In section 404 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978, as added by section 8102, insert after subsection (c) the following new subsection (and redesignate subsequent subsections):&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(d) Insect and Disease Threats.--Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1), non-industrial private forest lands are eligible under this section if the Secretary determines that the lands are under an imminent threat of loss or damage by insect or disease and immediate action would help to avoid the loss or damage.</chair>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise this evening to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), our distinguished chair of the Agriculture Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And first, let me just thank the gentleman for his hard work on the farm bill reauthorization and his dedication to moving our Nation forward in the area of agriculture, nutrition, conservation and energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to applaud his efforts to accommodate the various caucuses and coalitions across the country and in Congress, including the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the California delegation and the Hunger Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I come to the floor today to raise the important issue of concern to me and members of the Congressional Black Caucus regarding the lifetime ban of eligibility of food stamps for formerly incarcerated persons who were convicted of drug offenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes no sense to single out this group. Most recent figures show that nearly 213,000 State inmates were released in 2005 after serving a sentence for a drug crime, and most recent Federal data shows that 24,400 Federal inmates were released in 2002. After they serve their time, they reenter society looking to improve themselves and their lives. The task of finding a job for formerly incarcerated individuals is often difficult and a daunting task. This effort is even more difficult if they  want to go back to school, be it for their GED or college degree. In these instances, they are unable to access many of the resources available to others, including food stamps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inequity to this group couldn't be clearer. Drug offenses account for more than 50 percent of the crimes committed by Federal prisoners and more than 20 percent of State prisoners, most of whom are nonviolent offenders. With factors such as poverty and lack of access to educational resources, coupled with the lack of sufficient legal resources, this issue disproportionately affects the African American community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, the Congress, in an overzealous attempt to appear tough on crime, included in the Welfare Reform bill a provision that excluded formerly incarcerated persons from receiving food stamp benefits for life. This is a lifetime ban if they have ever been convicted of a drug crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Madam Chair, that is why I offered an amendment to the rule to <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill> to strike this ban. Although the amendment was not made in order, I strongly believe that this is an unfair and unjust policy which must be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he said "An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this policy has created a slippery slope, one that can be used to cherry-pick certain segments of the population who can eat, basically, while others must scrape and scramble for the basics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once someone has served their debt to society, they should be able to have access to the minimum amount of food vital to their survival while they get their lives together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope that I can work together with the distinguished Chair of the Ag Committee to ensure that this grave inequity is corrected.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="MODIFICATION TO AMENDMENT NO. 23 OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to engage the fine gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) in a colloquy on unfair practices in the poultry and meat packing industries, and want to commend him for this incredibly visionary piece of legislation. It is a real credit to him, to his dogged work and expertise over so many years in this Congress as well as in the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current contracted system of meat and poultry production often maneuvers farmers who do the actual work of raising and feeding billions of animals into subservient positions in today's marketplace and legal system. Poultry has become one of the most vertically integrated industries in our country, with four firms controlling nearly 60 percent of the broilers raised and sold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poultry, despite the worrisome rise of camphylobacter and salmonella through safety recalls, remains outside the normal oversight by USDA, even though GIPSA has oversight over beef and pork.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The Department of Agriculture has no real power to stop unfair practices in this industry. It surely has no mediation authority. Poultry contracts often are presented to farmers as take-it-or-leave-it contracts. In many cases farmers do not even see the actual contract until after they have gone to the bank. Farmers are not encouraged to negotiate contract terms that protect their interests, such as hedging against animal deaths and environmental cleanup costs, assuring accurate weights and measures  and fair feed and input pricing, or gaining a fair share of the value of the nitrogen-rich manure produced by the animals themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from Minnesota moves forward on the farm bill conference, I would urge him to give the USDA the full authority to protect against unfair practices in the poultry industry and to protect farmers' legal rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please give farmers legal standing in court. Provide them with transparency in pricing, as well as technical assistance with fair contracts. Assure weights and measures. Help them hedge against animal deaths and environmental cleanups. Provide for legal and safe working conditions for chicken catchers who are their primary workforce. Bring honor to this industry with contracting fairness to farmers and their workers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to thank Ms. Kaptur for bringing up this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Agriculture Committee and representative of the largest turkey-producing industry in the United States, I share your concern and interest in making sure that we are not putting poultry farmers at a disadvantage. We have worked hard on the committee to have an open process, and earlier this year the Subcommittee on Livestock held a hearing on issues similar to this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now as we continue to move forward in the farm bill process, we will keep this issue in mind and look forward to working with the gentlewoman to address her concerns in the conference committee.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other day there was a story in the newspaper about dead farmers who were still collecting benefits up to about $1 billion. This amendment would cut down on that type of fraud and bring real accountability to the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am from Chicago. In Chicago we kind of appreciate the ability of dead people to do spectacular things, but this would even bring an alderman to blush. A billion dollars to dead farmers still getting government benefits. I think a Chicago alderman would be jealous of this type of benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So after that report, a number of us put in an amendment to bring the type of accountability to the Department of Agriculture for the type of benefits that are applied and should only be applied to farmers who are farming, obviously, their farm and working, but not to dead farmers and to people who should not be receiving what they estimate is close to $1 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the chairman for allowing me to offer this to track down the fraudulent payments that have gone on in the Department of Agriculture and eliminate the type of waste, fraud, and abuse that exist.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SANDLIN, HERSETH" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today to support this amendment offered by my colleague and friend from Oklahoma. This amendment is critical to deliver on the promise that we made to American livestock producers this past May. After more than a year of effort--and despite several veto threats from the President--we were successful in passing much-needed disaster assistance through this Chamber and enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, several months after the bill's passage, the Secretary of Agriculture decided that a certain phrase in the bill effectively denies aid to all livestock producers that did not participate in the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program or the crop insurance pilot program for rangeland. I assure my colleagues that this was not the intention of Congress and, regardless of the accuracy of USDA's legal interpretation, we need to fix it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with Agriculture Committee leadership to find a solution to this problem and I am pleased this amendment was made in order. I also have shared this problem with the leadership of the Appropriations Committee to ensure that this year's Agriculture Appropriations bill contains language to address this as well, and I am pleased to report that it does. Using this dual-track approach, I am confident that we can solve this problem in time to prevent any delays in delivering this much-needed  assistance to American producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment will enable us to deliver on the promise we have made to deserving and distressed ranchers across this country, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank you for consideration of my amendment to <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment focuses on Title VII, which is the Research Title of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the amendment adds a section to the end of "Subtitle B," which contains provisions pertaining to the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1977 Act contains Section 1424, authorizing the "Human Nutrition Intervention and Health Promotion Research Program."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the nutrition research arm of the Department of Agriculture. The program authorizes the Agriculture Secretary to award research grants for human nutrition intervention and health promotion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1977 Act describes the "Emphasis of the Initiative." It goes on to say that research projects should emphasize:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coordinated, longitudinal research assessments of nutritional status; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The implementation of unified, innovative intervention strategies to identify and solve problems of nutritional inadequacy and contribute to the maintenance of health, well-being, performance, and productivity of individuals, thereby reducing the need of the individuals to use the health care system and social programs of the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my amendment would add one additional point regarding the emphasis of the nutrition research initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emphasis should also be placed on research proposals that examine the efficacy of current agriculture policies in promoting the health and welfare of economically disadvantaged populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The working poor suffer disproportionately from obesity and its related disorders: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, joint problems, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nutrition research should include matters relating to public health. My amendment specifies that the scope of human nutrition research include grant proposals that study the effectiveness of current agriculture policies in promoting the health of individuals living in poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These groups stand to benefit the most from nutrition research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayer dollars should be invested wisely, Madam Chairman. An investment in analyzing how well the Federal Government's agriculture policies enable Americans to live healthy lives and make good nutrition choices is money well spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment directs a sharper focus on nutrition research to help the economically disadvantaged.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill as presented significantly expands the ability of the Farm Credit System to operate in nonfarm contexts in two ways; first of all, in terms of the membership that would be required to be farm credit providers, and, secondly, in terms of the transactions in which they engage. And I think that would be  an error. And I believe that it is a mistake to allow an expansion into the banking system by entities that aren't banks. We have a particular  exemption in the Farm Credit System for agricultural lending, and it was meant to be lending by and to agricultural commodities. This bill goes beyond it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to say, and I have had conversations with the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Members have said that especially with the interest in alternative energy, there have been problems in getting loans from banks. I must say that, and I talked to my colleague the ranking Republican, no one has brought this to our attention. Had this been brought to our attention on the Financial Services Committee, we would have responded. And I want to say now, and I talked to the chairman of the  Agriculture Committee, I am prepared to have, I think we should have in the fall, joint hearings of our two committees, the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Financial Services, to listen to people's concerns here. And if it is documented that there have been problems with the availability</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, another issue that has been raised was allowing an increase in the town size, from 2,500 to 6,000. My reaction to that was favorable, but we were never able, as we were willing, to negotiate out some limitations and some expansions.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman from Massachusetts' amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we tried to do in the subcommittee, Mr. Lucas and I, was try to see that access to credit was readily available in rural America, particularly in the agriculture sector. We tried to find a way to form a compromise between a Farm Credit System and the banking industry. We held hearings and brought them together, and we found out we had managed to anger both sides; so maybe we had a pretty good compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Farm Credit System in the HORIZONS project wanted to expand rural housing from 2,500 to 50,000. They wanted to expand on agriculture lending to agriculture-related businesses, a great diversion from where they are limited right now. And we thought that was too far, but we wanted to make sure there was access to credit in rural America, and we think we came up with a pretty good compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In increasing the rural housing from 2,500 to 6,000, we are, all of us, not only in this committee, but this Congress, anxious to try to find ways to use renewable energy sources, and we believe that in this industry there is going to be a lack of credit. As the chairman of the full committee has said during this debate, he has noticed that in his home State of Minnesota. So we thought extending the credit to energy-related agriculture lending through the Farm Credit System was reasonable and  responsible and something that was a good compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Chairman, we feel in the committee that we have come up with a pretty good compromise, something that is going to reflect the conditions in rural America, and something that we believe that is in the best interest of rural America and the agriculture community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to reiterate the point made by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, the Farm Credit System is a very important thing for rural America. It provides credit to America's farmers and ranchers and is a necessary and serious challenge to get that credit sometimes. There have been times when business has been bad in rural America, and the Farm Credit System has been there to stand up in good times and bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the concerns raised by my friends in the banking community. We want to make sure that there is fair treatment, given that these are two different types of systems that operate, and we have listened to them very carefully. We have held hearings. And as the gentleman from Pennsylvania says, we worked very hard to come up with something we thought was fair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did basically three things: One related to housing, one related to lending in the energy area, and one dealing with cooperatives. All of these things are simply looking to modernize the Farm Credit System to deal with the fact that rural America and farming have changed substantially from the last time there was any major address of this issue back in the 1970s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rural population limit for home mortgages, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania pointed out, is 2,500 population. It has not been updated since 1971, and since then, over 700 communities have grown to the point where they are not considered rural under the farm credit definition, where you could get a farm credit loan in the past and now, because of the increased population, you can't. So people who have been doing business with farm credit sometimes for generations are no longer able to do  that. The law does not change the limitation on moderately priced homes, owner-occupied, single-family homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are simply trying to extend this to recognize that the population of the country is growing, and, therefore, there ought to be recognition of that. They asked for a very substantial increase, and we thought that was well beyond what was contemplated by being able to lend in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, with regard to energy, there is no doubt that when times are good, there are financial resources available, credit from a wide array of sources. But as the ethanol boom started in this country, there was not money available from some sources; so farm credit stepped up to the plate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for them to step up to the plate when the risk is higher, they need to be able to have a viable system throughout, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama, the senior Republican on the Financial Affairs Committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the Farm Credit System does fulfill a valuable service to the farmers of America, and we have no argument with that. But we all need to recognize that the Farm Credit System is a government-sponsored entity. It has the benefits and privileges of a government-sponsored entity, and the taxpayers underwrite its operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, traditionally they have made what we call farm loans, agricultural loans. There is much concern in the private lending market, independent bankers, small-town bankers, credit unions and thrifts that this role has been expanding. In fact, over half the loans made by the Farm Credit System are to farmers or corporations valued at over $1 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Where they were making agricultural loans, agricultural mortgages, now they're lending money to Cargill, ADM, Jack-in-the-Box, and retail businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is simply our way of saying that when you begin to compete with small-town bankers, with thrifts, with credit unions, it is a contact sport. And we need to take a step back and look at it. But at this time, we don't believe that any expansion, in fact, I'd like to submit for the Record a letter by Michael Reyna, who is the immediate past chairman and CEO of the Farm Credit Administration, in which he says that the pressure was always there to make off-farm loans, and he  submits this letter in support of our amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statement on the Frank/Bachus Amendement (#10) Submitted By Former Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Chairman and CEO Michael M. Reyna (2000-2004)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Man's best friend, protector, and hunting partner, the dog, holds a special place in the heart of rural America. The Farm Credit System (System) plays a very special role in rural America, too. Congress established the System, the Nation's oldest government sponsored enterprise (GSE), to achieve a very special public policy goal: a dependable source of credit for agriculture and rural America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(21) Typically, GSEs are established, structured, and intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the economic marketplace; a mechanism to free up capital for new loans. And, as their name implies, GSEs are chartered by the government and are given tax breaks and authority to issue government backed debt obligations, among other special advantages, to achieve their public policy goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike other GSEs, the System--with its special government breaks and authorities--directly competes as a retail lender against its private sector counterparts, namely banks and other financial institutions. Competition is a contact sport, but fair is fair and it's not hard to understand why many private sector lenders bristle when it comes to directly competing against a public sector lender with special tax breaks and a cheaper source of funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Striking a delicate balance, Congress wrote, and has amended, the Farm Credit Act with an eye towards focusing the public benefits of this GSE by limiting the types of loans that the System can make as well as where and to whom these loans can be made. Unsatisfied with the wisdom of Congress, the System has applied relentless pressure in recent years on its regulator, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), to grant ever broader lending authority and even to issue "no action letters" essentially  giving System lenders a "free pass" to disobey the law. As the immediate past Chairman of the FCA (2000 to 2004), I have directly experienced the System's pressure to get the FCA to give the System what it wants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Private sector lenders are well aware of these efforts, and the System's lending abuses are well-documented. And, notwithstanding the public relations campaign relative to its young, beginning, and small farmer lending efforts, the bulk of the System's public benefit goes to commercial agriculture--those farmers with retail sales in excess of one million dollars annually. This fact alone suggests a thorough review of whether the System is achieving its public policy purpose is in order, particularly  given that agricultural concentration has increased as the number of commercially viable farms in America continues to decline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than submitting a "secret" wish list of regulatory changes it wants the FCA to make behind closed doors through "notational votes," the System is now seemingly seeking to broaden its lending authority directly from Congress, through the Farm Bill (<bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>). Seemingly, because when it comes to legislation, the devil is in the details. A review of the proposed language raises legitimate concerns about exactly what authorities are being broadened and by how much. Without greater specificity,  the ambiguity will leave much to the System's regulator to sort out. Would the three-member FCA Board be a lapdog or a watchdog on these issues? Given its close ties to the System, is there really any doubt how the decisions would turn out?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The System's proposed changes to the Farm Credit Act are an outgrowth of its HORIZONS Project, a multi-year effort designed to justify an expansion of the System's off-farm lending powers. And, therein lies its primary flaw--the System's efforts are more about the System's growth and profitability rather than the credit needs of agriculture and rural America. When it comes to commercial agriculture, competition among lenders is healthy and credit is available and affordable. Consequently, there  is no public policy rationale to broaden the System's lending authority in this area, let alone expand its lending authority beyond agriculture either. In other words, "That dog don't hunt."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private-sector lenders now provide ample home-mortgage credit in towns with population between 2,500 and 6,000, often by selling those mortgages to the System's fellow GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Not only is there not a mortgage credit shortage in this population range, but authorizing the System to lend in communities larger than 2,500 will distract it from financing moderately-priced rural housing where it is most needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than responding to the System's relentless desire to finance corporate agriculture, Congress should undertake a comprehensive examination of the System's future role in financing agriculture and rural America. Only after such a detailed review should the Congress consider any expansion of the System's off-farm lending authority. Therefore, the House of Representatives should drop the HORIZONS provisions now in the Farm Bill by voting for the Frank/Bachus amendment #10.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Pennsylvania each have 1 minute.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself my remaining minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my friends have said they sought a compromise. The only problem is they had a unique motion here, it was the unilateral compromise, they compromised with themselves. And they did a pretty good job of compromising with themselves, but I think we need to compromise with each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two committees here that have concerns: one about the integrity of the banking system and not having non-banks get into the banking system. This House is aware of that because we dealt with a similar issue with regard to industrial loan corporations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are saying here, the gentleman from Alabama and I, is we were not previously told about a problem of a lack of availability of credit from the banking system for alternative energy. If that exists, it needs to be remedied. And as I've said, I've spoken to the chairman of the full committee; I've spoken to my ranking member on our committee. We're prepared to have joint hearings and be available for people to document to us what the nature of the problem is, and then respond, whether it's  an increase in size, or what. But I do think the history shows that we should be very careful about who gets into the banking industry and who doesn't. The banking system ought to be preserved very carefully.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400183" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank my friend for his comments. And I just want to assure him that we can count votes as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to our friend from Georgia (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I serve on both Agriculture and Financial Services, so I can look at this with a very jaundiced eye. And I think what we have to do is make a decision in this move based upon what the lay of the land is. First, we're talking about renewable energy and ethanol. Where is that going to take place? It's going to take place in the rural communities where the products, where the crops are that will make renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal is tied very tight, and I think that farm credit deserves to have an opportunity to compete in this new burgeoning industry. The businesses that are made eligible are ones that process or handle farm products that are directly used in renewable energy. This is very tight. I do not believe that the farm credit needs to be denied this opportunity. I do not think it blurs jurisdictional lines. We should not close the door on an industry, an opportunity for farm credit to provide a  service that is not directly competitive with our bankers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400150" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Frank-Bachus amendment to <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>. This vast expansion of the Farm Credit System is unnecessary and unwise. American businesses today enjoy the best financial services marketplace in the world. There are opportunities for credit at every turn. The current Farm Credit System was set up in a different era to offer all the products and services of a financial institution to farmers and farm-related small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A government sponsored enterprise for over 90 years, the Farm Credit System remains the only GSE with direct lending authority. In towns of 2,500 people or less, this system is able to compete directly with other lenders, but with major advantages given to them by their government-sponsored status. The historical justification for this special GSE status has been to focus the system on farmers and companies that provide farm related services. The expansion which the Farm Bill currently seeks  would dramatically alter the mission of the Farm Credit System and detract from its mission of helping farmers. There is no need for the expansion of this government entity and there is no vacuum to be filled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regardless of whether or not you disagree with the policy of the expansion of the Farm Credit System, you can disagree with the process used here to legislate. In a July letter to the Speaker, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Financial Services Committee asked for a sequential referral, yet were denied. While the Committee on Agriculture clearly has jurisdiction over the Farm Credit System, the Committee on Financial Services has jurisdiction over all extensions of credit and a referral  was justified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a recent letter written by the former regulator of the Farm Credit System, Michael Reyna, we see an objective analysis of this expansion. As Mr. Reyna mentions, the Farm  Credit System is seeking an expansion of their powers to move beyond their historical focus. "Therein lies its primary flaw--the System's efforts are more about the System's growth and profitability rather than the credit needs of agriculture and rural America. When it comes to commercial  agriculture, competition among lenders is healthy and credit is available and affordable."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not fix what isn't broken. Let's keep our government-sponsored lending operations tied to their original purpose and let's support the Frank-Bachus amendment.</paragraph>
