  <narrative>MISSISSIPPI RIVER PARKWAY COMMISSION -- (Senate - September 15, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8527">S8527</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when I visit eastern Iowa, I often drive along the Mississippi River. And there, on any given day, one can visit this area and marvel at the sight of the mighty Mississippi River winding its way south from Lake Itaska in Minnesota toward the Gulf of Mexico--a total distance of over 2,500 miles. From this vantage point, high above the river, you see pleasure boaters and fishermen spending the day on the water. You can see river barges carrying Iowa corn and soybeans  to far away markets. And most importantly, you see that this is a national treasure that needs to be protected and preserved for all generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mississippi Parkway Commission was created in 1938 in order to develop and oversee what was at that time called the Mississippi River Parkway. The Parkway Commission is the only organization connecting all 10 States bordering the Mississippi River, with a mission devoted to promoting, preserving, and enhancing the resources of the Mississippi River Valley, and to developing the amenities of the Great River Road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, 10 States, including my home State of Iowa, will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Mississippi River Parkway Commission and the Great River Road. Among the many accomplishments of the commision of the past 70 years are the development of a Great River Road Interpretive Center Network, a consumer Web site, and National Scenic Byway designation for the majority of the Great River Road. In carrying out its duties, the commission has partnered with a number of Federal agencies, including  the National Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Federal Highway Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Environmental Protection Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the occasion of its anniversary, I wish to congratulate the Mississippi River Parkway Commission, as well as the commission's new national Pilot, Patsi Ramicitti from Bettendorf, IA. I am pleased that Patsi's energy and dedication to advancing one of the region's most vital assets are being recognized. May her efforts and those of all past, present and future members of the commission continue to strengthen the knowledge of and access to the incredible natural resources offered by the mighty  Mississippi.</paragraph>
