    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an important issue for the people of the state of Wyoming. It is one that this body has attempted to address several times over the last three years, but never successfully: immigration reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year I introduced a "Ten Steps to Health Care" plan. This plan set forth 10 pieces of legislation that enacted as a group or individually would make positive changes in America's health care situation. I believe this approach will work well for the topic of immigration reform so I created a principles document of six steps to address this issue. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list--we have tried comprehensive approaches in the past and it doesn't work. This is a proposal of  six reasonable items, based generally on proposals and ideas in other pieces of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amnesty for illegal immigrants is not a part of this proposal. Amnesty rewards people for breaking the law and sends the wrong message to those  wishing to immigrate to our country legally. It puts illegal immigrants at the head of the line, in front of those who are following the rules in order to gain citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These six steps address border enforcement, interior enforcement, temporary worker programs, the employer verification system, English as our national language, and a merit-based permanent alien program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first step is what I have always said must be the top priority of any immigration reform proposal. Our Nation must have control of its borders. The enforcement of our laws is constitutionally the responsibility of the executive branch. Congress can ensure that we have adequate authorization and funding for continuing to hire and train border agents and they must have the proper authorization and funding to do their jobs. Congress already enacted the Secure Fence Act to increase the security  along our Southern border. The enactment of this law, however, has hit a number of snags. Congress should increase oversight over the construction of the physical barriers and the development of the elements of the virtual fence. To ensure that congressional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interior enforcement is also the responsibility of the executive branch and our law enforcement. Congress should use our authority to clarify the ability of local law enforcement to assist in the detention of illegal immigrants and the reimbursement of those costs from federal agencies. As a former mayor, I understand the burden placed on sherriff's departments, police departments, and highway patrols when their already strained budgets are impacted by the delays in receiving reimbursements.  Congress should also close loopholes that allow so-called sanctuary cities to avoid and ignore enforcement of Federal immigration laws. When these cities blatantly disregard Federal laws, they put their own citizens at risk by harboring those with no driver's licenses. These community leaders increase the burden on their taxpayers when social</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the best ways to help our businesses is by enacting some commonsense changes in our temporary worker system. The current system is serving as a deterrent for following our country's laws. The problems with this system are not about a policy debate in Washington, they are about the ability of a small business owner to operate, stay in business, and provide for their family. In Wyoming, I have heard from hospitality businesses under the H-2B program, ranchers under the H-2A program, and  high-tech businesses under the H-1B program. American workers would always be the preference, but the reality is that some businesses and industries are not getting the workers they need from our domestic labor pool. Businesses must first look for domestic workers--that is a fair requirement and I have not heard from any business in my State that disagrees with that. I want to work with the business community on this proposal to create language that truly addresses their workforce needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some ideas we should consider for an updated temporary worker system include requiring uniform procedures at all consular offices so that both employers and prospective employees understand their obligations, requirements, and the process. We could also reduce the amount of paperwork required for businesses going through the temporary worker process. We must reexamine the congressionally mandated caps on the visa numbers. The reality is that the need is much greater than what the caps currently  allow. Congress can raise the caps by reasonable levels and then allow for market needs and usage to permit reasonable fluctuation in the numbers. Above all, Congress must listen to the businesses in our Nation and work with them to create a realist program that meets security and economic needs. We cannot afford for even more small businesses to close or for large businesses to move overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another area affecting business is the employer verification system or E-Verify. I am hopeful that before the 110th Congress adjourns for the year, we will address the expiring authorization. As we look to the future, we need to consider making this program permanent. I understand there are some who are concerned about the accuracy of the program. We need to encourage usage of the system to determine what shortfalls may exist and how to fix them. I am pleased that the President has directed that  all Federal Government contractors use E-Verify. We should enact this requirement into law. We also need to give employers the option to verify the status of all employees and not just new hires. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, USCIS, should also be providing monthly reports to Immigration</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most common comments I have heard from the people of Wyoming is support for English as our national language. My proposal contains two elements addressing our national language. First, we should declare English as our national language. Currently, 30 States have laws in place doing so. A common language for our government unifies our citizens. We have a great Nation made up of immigrants and I encourage everyone, whether a new citizen or a 10th generation American, to keep their family's  traditions and cultures thriving in their homes and lives. This effort is about government documents and ensuring all citizens know what to expect from their government. The second part of this proposal eliminates an Executive order that may have been well intended, but has costly consequences. Executive</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final step in this plan is creating a merit-based permanent alien program. This concept is based on permanent alien programs of other industrialized nations like Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The United States should have a similar program in place. This concept does not eliminate permanent alien programs for families or those with refugee status but would allow our Nation to ensure that a larger portion of green cards are going to those individuals who are contributing  to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canada's point system allows for approximately 60 percent of permanent resident aliens to qualify based on their skills and their benefit to the Canadian economy. The remaining 40 percent of permanent resident grants are based on family relations or refugee status. Current U.S. law allows about 70 percent of our annual 1 million permanent resident admissions be based solely on family relations and only about 13 percent to be based on employment with the rest going to refugees and diversity visas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These six steps reflect ideas and concepts from a host of legislative proposals already introduced by my congressional colleagues. We could enact any one of these sensible proposals today and produce results tomorrow. I encourage my colleagues to listen to their constituents over the next several months. We need to get the message that Americans want our country's borders secure and our laws enforced. We need to hear the needs of our businesses and the financial concerns of our communities. The  message has not gotten through that there are ways to improve our immigration system and make positive changes without amnesty. The people of America want Congress to improve our immigration system and we have not yet listened to them.</paragraph>
