  <narrative>OPPOSE THE PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11049]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400274" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, many of the newly elected freshmen campaigned on a platform of ensuring a significant change of course from the Bush trade policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peru Free Trade Agreement is based on the same flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model that has been so devastating to industries all across our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I campaigned for this seat 5 years ago, the cornerstone of my campaign also was to fix our broken trade policies. I've seen firsthand what they have done to the State of Maine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that in order to address our trade imbalance, we have to change the trade model. The Peru Free Trade Agreement is the same old model with a little lipstick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is overwhelming opposition to the agreement by unions, environmental, consumer and small business groups. They're all asking Congress to oppose the Peru FTA. Who supports the bill? The large multinational corporations, Big Business, does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Tom Donahue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce,  states that he is "encouraged by assurance that the labor provisions cannot be read to require compliance with ILO conventions," we should be more than skeptical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have all heard that the Peru trade agreement text improves labor and environmental standards, we fail to hear that they were added on top of the same old NAFTA and CAFTA text. The bottom line: this is another Bush NAFTA expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Key unions are worried about the labor provisions. The new provisions require countries to adopt, maintain, and enforce only the terms of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new FTA language does not require signatories to meet the ILO conventions. That's the binding standards. The declaration is a nonbinding statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is highly likely that changes to the environment and labor provisions will have no real effect on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that the Bush administration has a long record of not enforcing the standards of past trade agreements. Why should they start now?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And there are so many problems with the Peru Free Trade Agreement, whether it's the privatization of Social Security, ban on anti-offshoring, or failure to protect our intellectual property rights. There are more than enough reasons to oppose the Peru FTA. Not to mention if you look at NAFTA, NAFTA has caused a worse problem here in the United States with illegal immigration. The Peru Free Trade Agreement will do the same thing, cause the illegal immigration problem to get worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on and on about the Peru FTA. I ask my colleagues to really listen to what America is saying about these free trade agreements. I'm asking Members to vote their conscience. Oppose the Peru FTA.</paragraph>
