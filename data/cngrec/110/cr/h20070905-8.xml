    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, how many ears must we have before we can hear people cry?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Census Bureau informed us that more Americans than ever before in our Nation's history are going without access to health care; 46 million, 46 million citizens have no health care coverage. But this national nightmare is measured best not in numbers, but in human lives. Families across Wisconsin are going bankrupt because they can't afford their medical bills. Teenagers across the country will go blind because they do not have access to the care they need for their diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress doesn't need a census report to feel people's pain. And as Members of Congress, we must not wait for yet another census report before we act. It is our duty and our moral responsibility to act now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People in Wisconsin and everywhere else in America demand we establish universal access to affordable care for every citizen, and working together, we will.</paragraph>
