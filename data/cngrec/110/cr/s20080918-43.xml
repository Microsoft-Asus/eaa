    <paragraph>Mr. President, while my city of Saint Paul was enjoying its moment in the spotlight earlier this month, we were also mourning the passing of one of our great storytellers, Don Boxmeyer. Throughout his life as a reporter, columnist and author, Don discovered and brought out the human strength and variety of Saint Paul as no one else has. That made him one of our most important citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don worked as a hard news reporter for the St. Paul Dispatch and the St. Paul Pioneer Press, and wrote a column for over two decades. Here is how he described his career in his own words:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realized that the interesting people and places nobody ever wrote about held more fascination to me and my readers than all the governors, mayors and city council members who never seemed to be much persuaded by my opinions anyhow. I began to collect hobos and hermits, bare-knuckled brawlers and bread-baking nuns, short order cooks and hockey coaches, drake mallards named Jake, and bridge tenders, band directors, bear hunters and quiet old men who wept softly when we talked about the friends  they'd left on the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he shared them with the rest of us with humor, respect and a love of the nobility of regular people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his book, "A Knack for Knowing Things," Don collected many of his best columns about Saint Paul and Minnesota. He wrote about Swede Hollow in Saint Paul, the Rondo neighborhood destroyed by the construction of I-94 and Saint Joseph's Orphanage. He wrote about Stillwater, Lake Superior and Ashby, MN, and hundreds of other places and the people who made them. If a new resident of our State or its capital city asked me to tell them what kind of place they had moved to, I would just give them  a copy of that book and let them discover it for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don Boxmeyer's life eloquently conveyed an important lesson: each of our communities has roots in the values and experiences of generations that came before and we need to capture them before they disappear. His oral history of places Minnesotans know well and events they only vaguely know about is a priceless gift to the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Somewhere I read about a moment of despondency in the life of Robert F. Kennedy as he mourned the death of his brother Jack. Attempting to comfort him, someone said something like, "It is tragic that he only got to serve for 1,000 days, but that's as long as Julius Caesar served and we still remember him." Robert Kennedy replied, "Yes, but Caesar had Shakespeare to tell the story."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Saint Paul and Minnesota are much the greater because we had Don Boxmeyer to tell our stories.</paragraph>
