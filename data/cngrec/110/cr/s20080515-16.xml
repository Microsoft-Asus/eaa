    <paragraph>This is a resolution of disapproval of an FCC rule dealing with media ownership. The Commerce Committee has passed this out to the floor of the Senate.

  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="CROSS OWNERSHIP RULE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleague from North Dakota for his work on media ownership issues and to engage him in a colloquy to clarify one point about the resolution of disapproval. I note that Senator Dorgan has long been a champion of media localism and diversity, issues that are quite important to me as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because I believe that the Federal Communications Commission ignored Congress's repeated admonitions about following appropriate processes in reaching the agency's new cross-ownership rules, I support this bipartisan resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet I believe that if the Senate adopts this resolution, the existing waivers contemplated under the FCC cross-ownership rule should be protected. This means that those waivers would not be a part of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have significant concerns that if these waivers are not protected, this legislation could harm some media markets and constituents' access to news and information in my State of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to confirm that this resolution, while it would nullify the revised version of the FCC's newspaper cross-ownership ban, would not undo or in any manner change the FCC's decision to grant permanent waivers to five existing newspaper-broadcast combinations, and thus grandfather them, as set forth in paragraphs 77 and 158 of the FCC's December 18, 2007 Report and Order. It is my understanding that this resolution will not affect these five specific waivers, and I would like to clarify  this understanding</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Dorgan, is it your goal and understanding that the waivers that the FCC granted in conjunction with the cross-ownership rule be protected?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="CROSS OWNERSHIP RULE">
    <paragraph>Under the Congressional Review Act, the resolution of disapproval is intended to overturn a specific rule, not other parts of an agency's order. The waivers are not rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution is written in a specific way referring to an order, but it is the rule that is nullified. These waivers could have been granted alone or under the previous cross-ownership ban. It is not the intention of this resolution to affect the waivers in the order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="CROSS OWNERSHIP RULE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the resolution of disapproval that repeals the recent Federal Communications Commission's media ownership rulemaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of this measure, I applaud Senator Dorgan for once again taking the lead in introducing critical legislation to overturn a misguided attempt by the commission to relax crucial media ownership rules--a move that will only lead to further consolidation within the industry that will ultimately harm consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues are well aware, consolidation in the media market has led to fewer locally owned stations, and less local programming and content. Indeed, it speaks volumes that the number of independent radio owners has plunged in the past 11 years by 39 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just in 1996 and 1997 alone, more than 4,400 radio stations were sold following the first round of consolidation following passage of The Telecommunications Act of 1996. Between 1995 and 2003, ownership of the top 10 largest television stations increased from 104 owners to 299 owners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, we know that locally owned stations aired more local news and programming than non-locally owned stations--and that is not just me talking. That is according to the FCC's own studies, which also found that smaller station groups overall tended to produce higher quality newscasts compared to stations owned by larger companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there should be no mistake--fewer independent, local stations mean less local content and programming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minority and women-ownership of media outlets are also at perilously low levels--currently only 6 percent of full-power commercial broadcast radio stations are owned by women and 7.7 percent are owned by minorities. Ownership of broadcast television is even lower--5 percent for women and only 3.3 percent for minorities. Instead of being a catalyst promoting localism and ownership diversity, the FCC's action will actually hasten the decline in these crucial areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation last fall held a hearing to consider these very issues, and the actions required for improvement. During that hearing, I and several of my colleagues voiced strong concern about Chairman Martin's intent to ease current media ownership rules, particularly because of the potential impact on localism and diversity in broadcasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I, along with many committee members, joined Senators Dorgan and Lott in introducing The Media Ownership Act of 2007, which was reported out of the committee favorably in December. This constitutes yet another step in the mounting opposition to the loosening of these crucial rules. We had hoped that Chairman Martin would heed not only our urgings, but the concerns expressed by the American public, and complete the 4-year-old rulemaking on localism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, on November 13, less than a week after that hearing, the Chairman issued a new proposal to lift the 32-year-old newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership ban in the top 20 media markets. Worse still, the FCC allowed only 28 days for the public to comment on the  proposal when it has historically provided 60 to 90 days on pivotal matters such as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, the FCC's actions demonstrate a litany of highly-misguided priorities that neglect to consider the full impact of the FCC's rule change on the American people. Therefore, this resolution of disapproval is necessary to rescind this haphazard approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say it feels a little like d&#xE9;ja 2 vu all over again, when nearly 5 years ago the FCC attempted a similar effort to relax another set of media ownership rules. And fittingly, the opposition to the commission's attempt then mirrors the opposition that is coalescing now. And the action we are considering now is reminiscent of the joint resolution passed by the U.S. Senate in September 2003, which I cosponsored, condemning the Commission's efforts to rewrite those rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that naturally begs the question--why would the commission continue to attempt to weaken media ownership rules when the American public has vociferously opposed these efforts time and again? When the U.S. Congress in 2004 enacted a statute prohibiting the FCC from raising national ownership limits above 39 percent? When the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rejected as arbitrary and capricious this attempt at revising the rules after finding the FCC had no factual basis for the limits it set?  We deserve an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many proponents for relaxing media ownership rules have pointed to the precipitous decline of the newspaper industry as the reason change is mandatory. They have even cited a recent report by the Newspaper Association of America, NAA, which found print ad revenue for the industry fell by 9.4 percent last year--the biggest decline since it started keeping records in 1950.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, what these proponents are neglecting to mention is that the NAA also found that online newspaper advertising revenue increased 19 percent last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore the NAA president and CEO John Sturm stated "newspaper publishers are continuing to drive strong revenue growth from their increasingly robust Web platforms." This hardly sounds like an industry in irreversible peril if this longstanding rule remains in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of this resolution will also argue that the FCC crafted a very narrow revision, lifting the cross-ownership ban for only the top 20 media markets, so this resolution is unnecessary. However, the FCC also adopted "four factors" and two broad "special circumstances" that would allow this ban to be lifted for a station in any media market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These scenarios and factors include evaluating financial condition, possible increased local news, as well as existing market media concentration, and news independency. Given the vagueness and loopholes that exist with the rulemaking, the "high hurdle" that the Commission has supposedly set for proposed combinations could be easily cleared by using only a stepladder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preventing further media consolidation has been a bipartisan effort, and the resolution before us today is no different. We must not allow the indispensable role the media plays in promoting diversity and localism to be further marginalized and miniaturized by unchecked consolidation within the industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to the American people to restore confidence in the FCC's commitment not only to uphold the public interest but to advance it and strengthen it. That is why it is undeniably incumbent upon the commission members to revisit these rules and establish a set of standards that will effectively promote localism and minority and women-ownership, not more media consolidation. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="CROSS OWNERSHIP RULE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we are considering a critical  piece of legislation. The resolution of disapproval is critical to the diversity of our media and I would like to thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership on the issue. In December, the FCC pushed through new media ownership rules on a partisan three to two vote. The proposal strips newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rules that have protected diversity for 32 years in the top 20  markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal has been described by the chairman as a modest rules change. That since it is restricted to the top 20 markets, and since it only applies to television stations not in the top 4 in ratings in those markets, its some sort of compromise. The reality is that is simply not true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To begin with, 44 percent of Americans live in the top 20 markets. This includes my State of New Jersey, which is split by two of the largest markets in the country. And there are a number of loopholes in the rule. Companies looking to consolidate either outside the top 20 markets or to purchase one of the 4 largest stations need only be granted a waiver from the FCC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The standards for granting these waivers are vague at best. Here is an example: one of the standards a company must show in order for a waiver to be granted is whether the broadcast station has enough editorial independence. How does anybody quantify that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is there is no way to objectively judge the parameters Chairman Martin's rule requires to grant the waivers. This means that depending on who is running the FCC, a waiver can be granted in any market or for any station. As Commissioner Adelstein put it so appropriately, this proposal is nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the FCC devotes its resources to opening up more loopholes for consolidation, the commission has done virtually nothing to address the issue of minority ownership. The reality of diversity in our Nation's broadcast ownership is a far cry from the reality in which we live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite making up 35 percent of the population and owning roughly 18 percent of all nonfarm businesses, minorities currently own only 3 percent of all broadcast TV stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in the best interests of our democracy that media ownership reflect the wealth of this Nation's diversity. As a public trustee of the broadcast spectrum, it is the responsibility of the FCC to advocate on behalf of women and minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet this Commission under President Bush has failed in this pursuit. In fact, the FCC has so mishandled the issue, nobody even uses their statistics on minority ownership anymore. The best estimates we have on minority ownership have to come from outside groups because the FCC simply doesn't have accurate reporting numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, the FCC released five studies conducted to help the commission comply with its own regulations that require the elimination of market-entry barriers for small business. These studies largely found that media consolidation negatively impacted minority ownership, and noted that minority owners face historic barriers to accessing capital from lending institutions to purchase broadcast outlets. But rather than act on these studies to address the underlying problems, the FCC took 4 years  to even issue a notice for public comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today we have a chance to overturn a misguided decision by the FCC. And we have a chance to tell the Commission that rather than spend their time on finding loopholes for major media corporations to buy up more outlets throughout our country, the FCC should be working to its charge as the trustee for America's airwaves.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="CROSS OWNERSHIP RULE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of <bill type="sj" number="28">S.J. Res. 28</bill>, a joint resolution disapproving the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, rule relaxing newspaper-broadcast media cross-ownership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of my colleagues, I am deeply troubled by the FCC's rulemaking that would allow greater consolidation of our media. The media is a tremendous force in our society. It can inform, educate, and entertain, as well as nourish our democratic dialogue. Unfortunately, the media also has less savory powers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, we have seen an increase in coarse and violent programming, coupled with a decrease in local news and hardhitting journalism. To say these trends are not in the best interest of the American people, and especially our youngest citizens, is clearly an understatement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, as corporate ownership over our media grows more concentrated, we see less and less of the diversity of our Nation. When programming is the same from coast to coast, our airwaves will no longer reflect the rich mosaic of our country and our citizens. Such a landscape should prompt the FCC to act with an overabundance of caution, but it has not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years ago, the FCC substantially relaxed the rules that govern media ownership in this country. Millions of Americans contacted the FCC to complain. The U.S. Senate voted to support a "resolution of disapproval" in response to the FCC's decision. Next, the courts got involved, and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals shipped the agency's handiwork right back to the FCC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, the FCC began a new rulemaking, and in November of 2007, the Commerce Committee held a hearing to discuss the effects of consolidation on localism and diversity in news and entertainment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the following month, the Senate made clear to the Commission that it had serious concerns about the FCC's process and its apparent rush to issue a new rule. But on December 18, 2007, over the objections of Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, the FCC approved a relaxed set of ownership rules under which newspaper- broadcast cross-ownership is permissible in the top 20 markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Senator DORGAN for introducing <bill type="sj" number="28">S.J. Res. 28</bill>, a joint resolution disapproving the FCC rule. I am pleased to join him as a cosponsor of this resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting <bill type="sj" number="28">S.J. Res. 28</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together we can send a strong and united message that media diversity is clearly in the national interest and that the U.S. Senate will defend that interest with all the tools at its disposal.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that I be recorded as voting no on <bill type="sj" number="28">S.J. Res. 28</bill>, a resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission with respect to broadcast media ownership.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="CROSS OWNERSHIP RULE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the resolution of disapproval of the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, recently issued rules on media cross-ownership. I want to commend my colleague from North Dakota for his leadership on this most important of issues. This resolution will nullify the ill-considered and hastily-passed rules pushed through by the FCC in December of last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several years, the effects of media consolidation have become extremely clear to the American people: Less local control and community-oriented programming; less independently produced programming; fewer divergent views and opinions; fewer minority-owned broadcast stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now, the FCC has green-lighted further media concentration by voting to overturn a 32-year-old rule prohibiting the cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations--a rule that could impact markets in which nearly half of the American public lives and works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Put simply, the FCC rule change would harm local and independent owners and help big media owners. In particular, the change further disadvantages minority media owners. While such owners control a mere 3 percent of the Nation's commercial TV stations, as many as 90 percent of minority media owners would be subject to these new rules. Further consolidation will simply reduce the number of opportunities for minorities to enter the market while putting those already in the market more at risk of  being forced out by larger media conglomerates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FCC argues that this rule is necessary to "save" the newspaper industry. But as an internal FCC study showed, despite all the stories we are hearing about newspaper cutbacks, publicly traded newspapers earn 16 to 18 percent annual rates of return. An internal FCC memo found the industry as a whole to be profitable. That is to say nothing of the fact that the FCC has given no compelling reason for it to be in the newspaper business in the  first  place. The FCC regulates the broadcast airwaves--and it should remain that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most disturbing is the way the FCC went about implementing this radical new rule. First, it completely ignored Congress's bipartisan bill, the Media Ownership Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. Then it ignored the public. Indeed, the Chairman's proposed rule changes were first made public in an op-ed he published in the New York Times outlining the changes for the first time--which might have been helpful had the public comment period not already closed the day his column appeared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public comments are not merely a formality, Mr. President--they are a vital piece of the rulemaking process and an integral part of responsive, open government. Five years ago, more than 3 million Americans spoke out when the FCC voted without any public input whatsoever to allow a single company to own up to three television stations, a local newspaper, a cable system, and as many as eight radio stations in a single media market. In large part because of the public outcry, the courts overturned  the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it isn't more consolidation and homogenization the American people want from their media--it is less. No one can seriously argue that the consolidation of the media in recent years has been a good development for the fourth estate. As coverage has become increasingly superficial, people wonder more than ever about the quality of the information they are receiving from the media. And quite frankly, I do not blame them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Must we act to ensure the strength and vitality of the American media in the 21st century? Absolutely. But that should be accomplished within an open and transparent framework as prescribed in the Media Ownership Act--a process that gives the public a voice in this fight. As the Senator from North Dakota has said, "Localism and diversity of media ownership is vital in a democracy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed it is, Mr. President. It is time to tell the FCC that this is no way to maintain a free, open and diverse media, and I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.</paragraph>
