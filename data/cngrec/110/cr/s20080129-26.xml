  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I rise today to speak about the war in Iraq. There is a lot of talk in this Chamber and across this town and across the country about our economy, and that is justifiable. But we have to remember that in the midst of a difficult economy in America, there is a lot to talk about and to work on to respond to that. We still have a war in Iraq to worry about, to debate, and to take action on. I don't think we can lose sight of a war that grinds on without end in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This war does burden our troops, obviously, with repeated and prolonged deployments and, in fact, drains our national resources. The war hampers our efforts in places such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real frontlines in the global struggle against Islamic terrorism and extremism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we must ask ourselves at least a couple of questions when it comes to the war in Iraq. There are many, but there are at least a few I can think of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are we in the Congress doing about this war today, this week, this month, and in the months ahead, even as we struggle to deal with a difficult economy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second question might be: When will the Iraqi Government start serious discussions on national reconciliation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, how will we know when we have achieved our objectives in Iraq? How will we know that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, and I think the most compelling question is: When will our troops come home?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, the President spoke about a number of topics, and one was the economy. One of the first words the President said with regard to the economy, he talked about a time of uncertainty. Mr. President--President Bush I mean--I disagree. With regard to the economy, this is not about something that is uncertain. It is very certain. The lives of Americans, the perilous and traumatic economy they are living through is not uncertain or vague or foggy. It is very certain. The cost of everything  in the life of a family is going through the roof, and we have to make sure we respond to that situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I argue that word "uncertainty" does apply when it comes to the war in Iraq in terms of our policy. I would argue to the President what is uncertain, if there is uncertainty out there in our land, it is about the war in Iraq. Uncertainty, frankly, about what our plan is in Iraq and what is this administration and this Congress doing to deal with this war in Iraq. That is where the uncertainty is. I think the reality of the economy is very certain for American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the headlines about Iraq have all but vanished from the front pages and television screens and the administration continues to divert attention elsewhere, we have a fundamental obligation as elected representatives of the American people to continue to focus on the war until we change the policy and bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We marked the first year anniversary of the President's decision to initiate a troop escalation in Iraq, and we are coming upon the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, in his State of the Union Address, the President described the surge in very positive terms. Make no mistake about it--we all know this--our soldiers have succeeded in their mission with bravery and heroism and violence in many parts of Iraq is, in fact, down. Yet despite all that, despite all that effort, despite all that work, Iraq today is still not a secure nation, and it will not be secure until its leaders can leave the Green Zone without fear of assassination. It will not be  secure until they can leave the Green Zone without fear of suicide bombings. It will not be secure until its own national Army and police forces can stand up and protect all of Iraq's people without regard to ethnicity or creed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In assessing whether the surge has worked, we should pay attention to the President's words from a year ago. President Bush declared in January 2007, when he first announced the surge:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders and the government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the President's words. So let's judge this issue by his words. Judged by those standards enunciated by the President, we can only conclude the surge has not worked, if that is what the objective was. I add to that, when I was in Iraq in August and I talked with Ambassador Crocker about the terminology used by this administration with regard to the war, because I said sometimes the terminology is way off and misleading, he said: The way I judge what is happening here is  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="424">S424</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based upon what Ambassador Crocker said and based upon what the President said, if we measure what is happening now against those standards, the surge has not worked, based upon those assertions by the Ambassador and by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The troop escalation did not prompt the Iraqi Government to make the hard choices or to meet the benchmarks laid out by the administration. As General Petraeus told me in that same meeting this past summer in Baghdad, the war in Iraq can only be won politically, not militarily, and he said that on the public record as well. But on national reconciliation, oil sharing, and other key issues where Iraqis must forge agreement in order to allow U.S. forces to eventually withdraw, we do not see nearly  enough progress. In fact, the evidence of substantial progress is very bleak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard recently about things that have been happening in Iraq. Although the Iraqi Parliament passed a debaathification measure this past month, it is unclear how far the legislation will go toward addressing Sunni concerns, since serious disagreements exist on the law's implementation. Some contend that former Baathists will still be barred from important ministries such as Justice, Interior, and Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has often occurred in the past, once again the Iraqi political leadership has chosen to avoid the hard choices and instead kick the can down the road, ensuring further bloodshed and national fragmentation in the interim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know how long this war has endured. It has endured longer than the war we know as World War II. It is longer than that war, with over 3,900 dead, 178 Pennsylvanians, the number of wounded in Pennsylvania is about 1,200 or more; across the country, 28,000. Our military forces have done everything we have asked of them. They have matched the bravery and success in every way possible of those great American warriors who preceded them in past conflicts. But our troops, the best fighting men  and women in the world, cannot force a foreign government to be stable, they cannot force the Iraqi national police to put aside their deep-seated sectarianism and corruption, and they cannot force Iraqi political leaders to want progress as much as our troops do and as much as the Iraqi people deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have much to do to make progress. But here is what is happening lately. This is a very important point, and I conclude with it. The President is showing every sign that he intends, in the waning days of his administration, to lock the United States and, in particular, to lock our fighting men and women into a long-term strategic commitment in Iraq without consultation with the elected representatives of the American people in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has signaled to the Iraqi Government that the United States can maintain significant U.S. troop levels in Iraq for at least 10 years--10 years--if not longer. He seeks to negotiate a long-term strategic agreement with the Iraqi Government that would commit the United States to providing security assurances to the Iraqi Government against external aggression--an unprecedented commitment that could embroil the United States in a future regional conflict or even a full-scale Iraqi civil war.  The President's senior aides have proposed that such an agreement would need to be ratified by the Iraqi Parliament--the Iraqi Parliament--and bypass the U.S. Congress. That is unacceptable to me and I think to anyone in this body and to the American people, and it is why five other Members of this body joined me in December in sending a letter to the President stating that the Congress must be a full and coequal partner in extending such long-term commitments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my letter of December 6, 2007, to the President.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. SENATE,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, December 6, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>Dear Mr. President:  We write you today regarding the "Declaration of Principles" agreed upon last week between the United States and Iraq outlining the broad scope of discussions to be held over the next six months to institutionalize long term U.S.-Iraqi cooperation in the political, economic, and security realms. It is our understanding that these discussions seek to produce a strategic framework agreement, no later than July 31, 2008, to help define &lt;em&gt;"a long-term relationship</narrative>
  <narrative>The future of American policy towards Iraq, especially in regard to the issues of U.S. troop levels, permanent U.S. military bases, and future security commitments, has generated strong debate among the American people and their elected representatives. Agreements between our two countries relating to these issues must involve the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co-equal branch of the U.S. government. Furthermore, the future U.S. presence in Iraq is a central issue in the  current Presidential campaign. We believe a security commitment that obligates the United States to go to war on behalf of the Government of Iraq at this time is not in America's long-term national security interest and does not reflect the will of the American people. Commitments made during the final year of your Presidency should not unduly or artificially constrain your successor when it comes to Iraq.</narrative>
  <narrative>In particular, we want to convey our strong concern regarding any commitments made by the United States with respect to American security assurances to Iraq to help deter and defend against foreign aggression or other violations of Iraq's territorial integrity. Security assurances, once made, cannot be easily rolled back without incurring a great cost to America's strategic credibility and imperiling the stability of our nation's other alliances around the world. Accordingly, security assurances  must be extended with great care and only in the context of broad bipartisan agreement that such assurances serve our abiding national interest. Such assurances, if legally binding, are generally made in the context of a formal treaty subject to the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate but in any case cannot be made without Congressional authorization.</narrative>
  <narrative>Our unease is heightened by remarks made on November 26th by General Douglas Lute, the Assistant to the President for Iraq and Afghanistan, that Congressional input is not foreseen. General Lute was quoted as asserting at a White House press briefing, "We don't anticipate now that these negotiations will lead to the status of a formal treaty which would then bring us to formal negotiations or formal inputs from the Congress." It is unacceptable for your Administration to unilaterally fashion  a long-term relationship with Iraq without the full and comprehensive participation of Congress from the very start of such negotiations.</narrative>
  <narrative>We look forward to learning more details as the Administration commences negotiations with the Iraqi government on the contours of long-term political, economic, and security ties between our two nations. We trust you agree that the proposed extension of longterm U.S. security commitments to a nation in a critical region of the world requires the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co-equal branch of our government.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Robert P. Casey, Jr.,</narrative>
  <narrative>Robert C. Byrd,</narrative>
  <narrative>Edward M. Kennedy,</narrative>
  <narrative>Jim Webb,</narrative>
  <narrative>Hillary Rodham Clinton,</narrative>
  <narrative>Carl Levin,</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>We now learn that the President, in signing the Department of Defense authorization bill into law yesterday, has once again taken the opportunity to issue another infamous signing statement, imposing his own interpretation of a law over the clear intent of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's not forget that this important legislation has been needlessly delayed for weeks because the President wanted to defer to concerns of the Iraqi Government over compensation for U.S. victims of Saddam Hussein's acts of terrorism. Let me repeat that. A critical pay raise for our troops was delayed because a foreign government raised concerns with this White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In signing the Department of Defense authorization bill into law, the President declared his right to ignore--ignore--several important provisions, including the establishment of an important special commission to review wartime contracting. This provision was an initiative of the Senate Democratic freshmen class, led by Senators WEBB and MCCASKILL. The President also declared his right to ignore a provision prohibiting funding for U.S. military bases or installations in Iraq that  facilitate "permanent station" of U.S. troops in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that again in plain language. This provision sought to prevent the United States from establishing permanent bases in Iraq, and  the President has indicated he may ignore--ignore--this provision. Every time senior administration officials are asked about permanent military bases in Iraq, they contend it is not their intention to construct such facilities. Yet this signing statement issued by the President yesterday is the clearest signal yet  that the administration wants to hold this option in reserve. This is exactly the wrong signal to send both to the Iraqi Government and its neighbors in the region and to others as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Permanent U.S. military bases gives a blank check to an Iraqi government that has shown no evidence that it is ready to step up and take full responsibility for what happens in Iraq. Permanent U.S. military bases feeds the propaganda of our enemies, who argue that the U.S. invasion in 2003 was carried out to secure access to Iraq's oil and establish a strategic beachhead for the U.S. military in the region. Permanent U.S. military bases means U.S. troops will be in Iraq for years to come, ensuring  that the great strain on the American military will continue indefinitely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, and I will conclude with this, we have a lot on our plate this year to deal with. We have the economy to deal with and so many other difficult issues, but the war in Iraq continues to be a central foreign policy challenge faced by the President, by the Congress, and by the Nation. When this President departs office after 8 years, he should not--should not--commit our soldiers and our Nation to 10 more years--10 more years--if not longer, and hundreds of billions of dollars, if not more,  spent on the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my understanding, under a previous unanimous consent request, that I would be recognized for up to 35 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is correct.</chair>
