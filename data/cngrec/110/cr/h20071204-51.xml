    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this evening in recognition of World AIDS Day, which took place last Saturday, December 1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, all through last week and into the weekend, events were held all around our country and throughout the world recognizing World AIDS Day. This solemn day provided us with the occasion to commemorate the lives of those who have died of this disease, more than 25 million people worldwide, and express our solidarity with those who are currently living with the disease, over 33 million people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the good fortune last week to travel with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation to South Africa, where we celebrated and commemorated World AIDS Day with Congresswoman Dr. Donna Christensen. Our delegation met with the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Johannesburg. We spoke to the group about our support for increased funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or better known as PEPFAR, and the importance of the private sector  in fighting the pandemic. Later, we visited an HIV/AIDS testing site located in the Zola area of Soweto, sponsored by Levi Strauss Red for Life Initiative, Centers for Disease Control, USAID, and State Department and other organizations, and I had the chance to talk to young people about the importance of getting tested and knowing their status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Together, Congresswoman Christensen and I helped lead by example by getting tested publicly, and we noted the very thorough pre- and post-testing counseling as well as the emphasis on maintaining confidentiality. We were very inspired to see young people sign up for testing, and some actually came up and told us that our speeches had convinced them to get tested. This really was remarkable and gave us a glimpse as to what we need to do more and more and more with our young people here  in America also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ended our trip at the United States Embassy where we helped to hang a giant AIDS ribbon and spoke to the assembled diplomatic corps about HIV and AIDS and the importance of our collective struggle against the disease. We had an opportunity to meet with the great moral and religious leader Bishop Desmond Tutu, and Bishop Tutu had spoken earlier at the Swedish and Norweigian Embassy, and he talked about helping to fight this global HIV/AIDS pandemic just as we helped fight to end apartheid in  South Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was especially important to be in Africa last week, because the discussions with regard to the reauthorization of PEPFAR will be coming up very shortly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And tonight I must take a moment and ask that my remarks include my sympathy for Henry Hyde, Chairman Hyde's family. I thought about Chairman Hyde during our visit, because we worked together on the initial PEPFAR legislation. He was committed to address this HIV pandemic. He ensured that this bill became a bipartisan bill. And even though we didn't agree on every issue, tonight I commemorate him and I give my sympathy to his family because, as we reauthorize this, his spirit and his hard work  and his legacy certainly will prevail as we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the key issues which remain were addressed in South Africa as it relates to the PEPFAR reauthorization.  Some of them included addressing the abstinence until marriage earmark and the onerous prostitution pledge; reducing the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV and AIDS by empowering them through my legislation, such as the PATHWAY Act; sharpening our focus on orphans and vulnerable children, which of course Chairman Hyde was committed  to; better integrating nutrition and wrap-around programs. We also have to expand support for health systems and strengthen delivery of basic health care services. And, of course, I believe that we must provide $50 billion, not $30 billion as the President has asked for, but $50 billion over the next 5 years for this initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And AIDS is also disproportionately affecting those who live in the Caribbean and also in black America. All across demographic ranges, African Americans are the most likely to get infected with HIV and to die from AIDS. The unfortunate reality is that to be black in America is to be at greater risk of HIV and AIDS. And the numbers are staggering, but I want to mention a few specifically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the CDC, in 2005, African American women accounted for 66 percent of all new HIV and AIDS cases among women. Compared to white women, African-American women were 25 more times likely to be infected. Today, AIDS is the number one cause of death among African-American women between the ages of 25 and 34. We can no longer wait for this administration to take action. We have to take action immediately to address this pandemic.</paragraph>
