    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with great honor that I rise today in order to recognize the heroism of Marine PFC C. Stuart Upchurch, Sr., and Marine Cpl Richard E. Vana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Battle of Okinawa, fought on the Japanese island of Okinawa, was the largest amphibious assault during the Pacific Campaigns of World War II. The battle lasted from late March through June 1945, and was the last major campaign of the War in the Pacific. The battle has been referred to as the "Typhoon of Steel" in English, and tetsu no ame--"Rain of Steel"--in Japanese. These nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of gunfire, and sheer numbers of Allied ships and  armored vehicles that assaulted the island. More ships were used, troops put ashore, supplies transported, bombs dropped, and naval guns fired against shore targets than any other operation in the Pacific.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were over 72,000 United States casualties at Okinawa, of which 12,513 were killed or missing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last days of the Battle for Okinawa, PFC C. Stuart Upchurch, Sr., and Cpl Richard E. Vana were marines assigned to the 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon, Baker Company, 4th Regiment, 6th Marine Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On or about June 1, 1945, Baker Company came under heavy Japanese mortar fire. Corporal Vana and Private First Class Upchurch were on the way back to their unit, having filled in at Charlie Company's defensive line the night before. With no foxhole of their own, Vana and Upchurch jumped into the first position they could find, sharing the foxhole with a new lieutenant and another marine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a nearby foxhole was struck by enemy mortar fire, a marine manning the position could be heard crying for help. Under the onslaught of constant enemy fire, and with complete disregard for their own well being, Vana and Upchurch ran up the hill to assist the marines. Inside the foxhole that took a direct hit, they found "Red" and Richey, cousins from the Boston area. "Red" had been fatally wounded and Richey was seriously injured. Richey was suffering from a life threatening arterial  wound to the upper thigh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still under the barrage of Japanese mortars, Vana and Upchurch proceeded to drag Richey out of the foxhole and down the hill. Upchurch then carried the marine while Vana provided protective cover. They made way for a cave which was being used as an aid station. Inside the cave, Vana and Upchurch provided critical lifesaving first-aid until a corpsman was able to assist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without the selfless and courageous actions of Vana and Upchurch, Richey would have perished from his severe wounds. Their actions exemplify the Marine Corps motto "Semper Fidelis," meaning "Always Faithful."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PFC C. Stuart Upchurch, Sr., and Cpl Richard E. Vana's gallant actions in close contact with the enemy, and unyielding courage and bravery, are in the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon themselves, their unit, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the United States of America.</paragraph>
