  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my pleasure, along with that of my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, to recognize the 175th anniversary of Kalamazoo College. Kalamazoo College enjoys the distinction of being Michigan's oldest college and one of our Nation's 100 oldest colleges. This occasion will be marked by a series of celebrations this spring, beginning with the Founder's Convocation on April 24, 2008. It is with pride that Senator Stabenow and I bring this milestone  to the attention of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception in 1883, Kalamazoo College has made immeasurable contributions to the academic, economic, and cultural life of the Greater Kalamazoo area, the State of Michigan, and the world community. Founded by Baptists as the Michigan and Huron Institute, this institution was formally named Kalamazoo College in 1855.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Devoted to the study of liberal arts and sciences and with an enduring mission "to prepare its graduates to better understand, live successfully within and provide enlightened leadership to a richly diverse and increasingly complex world," Kalamazoo College has earned a national reputation as a respected, private, 4-year coeducational college. Central to this mission is the Kalamazoo Plan, a program established in 1962 that integrates career development internships and study abroad experiences  with a rigorous academic curriculum and an individualized senior project. The Kalamazoo Plan was initiated under president Weimer Hicks and seeks to create an academic community where students are engaged in leadership and connected to their global surroundings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the college's study abroad program. Kalamazoo College offers over 50 study abroad programs on 6 continents, and more than 80 percent of its students participate in these programs, which is among the highest of any college in the Nation. In addition, Kalamazoo College ranks among the top 10 in the number of alumni participating in the Peace Corps. Guided by the concept of "fellowship in learning," Kalamazoo College has continued to strive to meet  the challenges presented by an ever changing and increasingly interdependent world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notably, Kalamazoo College ranks among the top 20 liberal arts colleges in the country for students receiving Fulbright awards and 19th nationally in the percentage of graduates who earn doctoral degrees. In addition, the college received the State of Michigan Governor's Service Award in 2006, with the Kalamazoo Public Schools, for the AMIGOS Program, a bilingual program for mentoring middle school students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kalamazoo College is an NCAA Division III school and offers eight intercollegiate sports for both men and women. An especially impressive athletic accomplishment is the tennis team's record of 69 successive MIAA championships, from 1936 to 2007, the longest streak by any athletic team at any level at any time. Kalamazoo College is also proud to have hosted the USTA Boys 18 &amp; 16 national tennis championships since 1943.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know our Senate colleagues will join us in congratulating the past and current faculty, staff, and students of Kalamazoo College as they celebrate the school's 175th anniversary. We wish them continued success in the years ahead.</paragraph>
