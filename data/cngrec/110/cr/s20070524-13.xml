    <paragraph>Mr. President, today is going to be a day of great importance to America. We are going to be voting on the supplemental bill to fund the surge and the number of soldiers on duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. But last night we learned the body of one of the missing soldiers in Iraq was found. Despite our prayers, he was dead. We were informed that the body of Joseph Anzack, Jr., was pulled from the Euphrates River south of Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 12, he and two of his colleagues went missing after they were ambushed by insurgents. How did the capture of three Americans take place? Are we short of troops to back them up or is it so dangerous we just can't overcome the odds we face?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of America is hoping and praying, as we keep these other two soldiers in our hearts and our minds, that they will be found alive by the troops searching for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the soldiers searching for their two colleagues said something to the Associated Press. I quote him here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It just angers me that it's just another friend that I've got to lose and deal with, because I've already lost 13 friends since I've been here and I don't know if I can take it anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of America feels the same way. Outside of my office in Washington we have a tribute called "The Faces of the Fallen." Visitors from across the country have stopped by this memorial--pictures of those who perished. I encourage my colleagues to come and see these photographs displayed on placards on the third floor of the Hart Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning of May, and we are now at the 24th of May, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 75 of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan coming from thirty-one different states. I want them to be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am going to read their names into the Record. As we listen to the names, the real cost of this war is being felt in many homes across this country.</paragraph>
