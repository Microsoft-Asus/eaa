    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution honoring the legacy of Harriet Ross Tubman, the abolitionist, humanitarian, Union spy, and daughter of Maryland whose selfless efforts throughout her lifetime helped hundreds of slaves realize freedom. My resolution supports the goals and ideals of a national day of remembrance for this American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Araminta Ross was born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland, around 1820 and worked as a slave for several families throughout her childhood. Abused and beaten, she suffered a serious head injury that would affect her for the rest of her life. In 1844, she married John Tubman and took the first name of her mother, Harriet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1849, Harriet Tubman escaped to Philadelphia. She launched her work as a "conductor" on the Underground Railroad soon after, making several trips back for family members and friends. Tubman continued to risk capture for more than a decade, delivering enslaved people from bondage to freedom in New England and Canada. Referred to as "Moses" because of her courage and sacrifice, she personally led more than a dozen expeditions, helping approximately 70 slaves escape. Her efforts and extensive  network of contacts along the Underground Railroad provided instruction for dozens more slaves to make the journey to freedom. She once stated, "I never ran my train off track, and I never lost a passenger."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1859, Harriet Tubman purchased a home for her family in Auburn, New York. While there, she continued her role as an abolitionist, making several trips to Boston to speak alongside Frederick Douglass and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Tubman volunteered. She worked for the Union Army as a nurse, scout, spy, and recruiter, and became the first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, resulting in the liberation of hundreds of slaves. Traveling through Maryland, South Carolina, and Virginia, Harriet Tubman risked disease, capture, and physical injury to support the Union Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, Harriet Tubman returned to Auburn. She became active in the women's suffrage movement and worked alongside Susan B. Anthony and Emily Howland. She continued to fight for human dignity, human rights, and equal justice throughout her lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1896, Harriet Tubman purchased 25 acres of land in Auburn to create a home and hospital for indigent, aged, and sick African-Americans. Opened on June 23, 1908, the Harriet Tubman Home for the Sick and Aged was the State's only charity outside of New York City dedicated to the shelter and care of African-Americans. Harriet Tubman died from pneumonia in the home that bore her name on March 10, 1913, surrounded by family and friends. In recognition of her service to this country, she was buried  with military honors at the Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harriet Tubman's legacy is one of selflessness and dedication to human rights. She inspired generations of African-Americans struggling for equality and civil rights and she has been praised worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harriet Tubman has received innumerable commendations for her role in American history. In 1944, the Maritime Commission launched the SS Harriet Tubman, the first Liberty ship ever named for an African-American woman. In 1978, Harriet Tubman was the first honoree of the Postal Service Black Heritage Stamp Series. She is also designated as a saint in the Episcopal Church's Book of Common Prayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public Law 101-252 designated March 10, 1990, as Harriet Tubman Day. My home State of Maryland, as well as Delaware, Georgia, New York, and Texas host annual celebrations on March 10 to honor the life of Harriet Tubman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harriet Tubman's dedicated pursuit of the American ideals of equality and liberty continues to inspire all who cherish freedom. It is appropriate to honor the life of Harriet Tubman on March 10 each year in recognition of this remarkable woman's contributions to the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate support for this resolution would encourage the people of the United States to participate and support ceremonies, programs, and other activities in remembrance of Harriet Tubman and to acknowledge her importance in American history. Mr. President, as we close Black History Month and enter Women's History Month, I am proud to introduce this resolution honoring Harriet Ross Tubman, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
