    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Douglas K. O'Connell, a recipient of the 2007 Rotary Paul Harris Award. The world's first service club, The Rotary Club of Chicago, IL, was formed in 1905 by Paul P. Harris, an attorney who wished to recapture in a professional club the same friendly spirit he had felt in the small towns of his youth. As Rotary grew, its mission expanded to help serve communities in need around the world. Today, 1.2 million Rotarians belong to some 32,000 Rotary clubs  in more than 200 countries. Local Rotarians constantly pool their resources and contribute their talents to help serve their local communities and address such pressing issues as illiteracy, environmental degradation, world hunger, and children at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 20 years, Mr. O'Connell has donated countless hours of community service to the northwest corner of Connecticut. Through his work with the Winsted Chapter of Rotary, United Way, the YMCA, as a volunteer basketball coach, and a dedicated member of the Torrington Board of Education, Mr. O'Connell has made a longlasting impact on his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. O'Connell embodies Rotary's principal motto: "Service Above Self." Mr. O'Connell, a talented attorney himself, is receiving the Paul Harris Award in appreciation of his tangible and significant assistance given for the furtherance of a better understanding and friendly relations between the peoples of the world in the true spirit of Rotary.</paragraph>
