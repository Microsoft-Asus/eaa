    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month more than 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington to participate in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program is the most extensive educational program in the country, developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pride that I recognize a class from my own Highlands High School of Fort Thomas, Kentucky, in the Fourth District for their accomplishment in this competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These outstanding students, using knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's capital and compete at the national level. At the national level, these dedicated students won the Unit One: Foundations of Democracy Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take a moment to recognize the names of these outstanding young people from Highlands High School: Alex Adams, Evan Bush, Kara Dyer, Jessica Earlywine, Jessica Federle, Maria Gurren, John Holloway, Alan Hutchinson, Marjorie Kimball, Connie Kremer, Sam Laskey, Heather Moyer, Emily Nordling, Anna Remley, Lauren Runk, Andrea Spencer, and Corwyn Wyatt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Julie Kuhnhein, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the national finals. Also worthy of special recognition are Rachel Bingham and Robin Winkfield, the State coordinators, and Glenn Manns, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People program in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate these students on their exceptional achievement at the We the People national finals. One thing we can all remember is that  there is no substitute for participating in the governmental process, no substitute for the investment of our lives and our time. I commend all of you for your hard work and for the long hours of preparation, and commend you for a victory well earned, well deserved and bringing honor and credit to the Fourth District  of Kentucky.</paragraph>
