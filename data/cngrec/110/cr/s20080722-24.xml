  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 25 through July 27, the residents of Minnewaukan will celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnewaukan is a small town with a population of 318 residents located in Benson County in northeastern North Dakota. In 1883, the town site was founded as one of several sites competing for the important Northern Pacific Railroad connection at the west end of Devils Lake. It became the county seat in 1884. The name is based on the Indian name Mini Waukon Chante, meaning water of bad spirits. The post office was established on March 12, 1884, by Thomas B. Ware. In 1898, Minnewaukan became a city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Minnewaukan remains a proud community that has a prosperous economy consisting of farming, service businesses, outdoor tourism, computer processing and retail businesses. Like so many smaller rural communities in North Dakota, Minnewaukan is a tight-knit town where everyone knows their neighbor. The Minnewaukan Community Club is a valuable asset to the community. The efforts of the club have successfully established a thriving fish cleaning station and boat ramp in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnewaukan is a great place for enjoying the outdoors all year round, including hunting, fishing, boating, and camping. People from across the State and Nation are drawn by the lengthy seasons and abundant populations of waterfowl and fish. Grahams Island State Park provides citizens of the community and tourists an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of North Dakota through hiking, canoeing, biking, horseback riding and cross-country skiing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community has planned a wonderful weekend celebration to commemorate its 125th anniversary. Current and former residents of Minnewaukan will gather to celebrate this special occasion. The celebration includes an all-school reunion, a 5k walk/run, parade, fireworks display, concerts, and much more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Minnewaukan, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Minnewaukan and all the other historic towns of North Dakota, we keep the pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Minnewaukan that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnewaukan has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
