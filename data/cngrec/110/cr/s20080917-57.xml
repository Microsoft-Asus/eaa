  <narrative>HONORING CONGDON'S DOUGHNUTS -- (Senate - September 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8945">S8945</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as our Nation and our world become increasingly complex and fast paced, it may seem easy to lose track of the simple but essential ties that bind us to those in our communities. It is with pleasure that I recognize a small family business from my home State of Maine that has succeeded in ushering a timeless classic into the modern world. Congdon's Doughnuts in Wells has been a York County institution for well over 50 years, providing tasty treats and community support  for generations of locals and tourists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the early riser among us, few indulgences are more appealing than a sticky sweet doughnut and a fresh-brewed cup of coffee. Congdon's Doughnuts has provided just that to thousands of customers as it has churned out up to 10,000 homemade doughnuts a day for three generations. Founded in 1945, and located at its current site since 1955, the company has undergone many of the trials and tribulations that often challenge America's small businesses. Yet through the hard work and unwavering dedication  of the Congdon family and their employees, the business has transformed itself from a small wholesale doughnut operation to a three-meal-a-day restaurant and bakery. Under present managers Gary Leech, son of Eleanor Congdon, and his wife Diane Leech, Congdon's also added</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While known for providing plentiful options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the centerpiece of the Congdon enterprise remains its timeless and highly acclaimed doughnuts. With dozens of tempting and delicious varieties of the traditional breakfast morsels, from cinnamon and coconut to chocolate honey and apple fritter, Congdon's has something to satisfy any doughnut eater and has garnered acclaim both locally and nationally. Indeed, Portland Magazine, a regional publication, has placed Congdon's  doughnuts on its list of "101 of Maine's Guiltiest Guilty Pleasures," and in 2007 Congdon's was included on the Doughnut Honor Roll of seriouseats.com, the Web site of famed food critic Ed Levin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Congdon's has long been involved in local charitable and community efforts, for the last 2 years it has institutionalized the commitment to its neighbors by joining other local businesses to host weekly benefit barbeques. Every Wednesday in July and August, community members come together for fun-filled tropical-themed parties. Ticket sales for these popular events have raised money for local and national charities and organizations including the American Heart Association, Southern Maine  Parent Awareness, and Trolley for Togus, which provides transportation for York County veterans to Maine's VA hospital. Additionally, last December Congdon's offered its guests holiday cards to sign for our Nation's soldiers, and then sent over 500 of them to men and women serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congdon's Doughnuts exemplifies the best qualities of being both a prosperous business and a caring neighbor. It is with great pride that I congratulate Condgon's on its decades of successes and I wish them the best of luck for the future as they continue to reach new heights as a purveyor of delectable treats and old-fashioned American cuisine.</paragraph>
