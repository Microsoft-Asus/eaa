  <speaking speaker="412209" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an amazing team from the Second District of Iowa, which I represent. I'm proud to stand before my colleagues today and commend the University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team for winning the 2008 NCAA Division I national wrestling championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many wrestling fans know, the University of Iowa has a celebrated history of exemplary wrestlers and coaches who have allowed the University of Iowa, the city of Iowa City, and the entire State of Iowa to boast numerous Big Ten titles and NCAA championships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In total, the University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team has won 32 Big Ten Conference championships and, since 1975, a total of 21 NCAA Division I national wrestling championships. The current team has kept the Hawkeye record strong, and it's my privilege to congratulate them on the 32nd Big Ten title and the 21st national championship for the school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team is led by Head Coach Tom Brands, who, in addition to this championship win, was named Big Ten Coach of the Year and National Wrestling Coaches Association Coach of the Year. Under Coach Brands' leadership, along with his assistants and strength coaches, the team also had two individual national champions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mark Perry won his second national title even while overcoming a knee injury during his match and also was awarded his fourth All-American honor. Brent Metcalf won his first national title. He was also awarded his first All-American honor, the Dan Hodge Trophy, was named Big Ten Wrestler of the Year, was crowned a Big Ten champion, finished the season with a 32-match winning streak, was named outstanding wrestler at the NCAA and Big Ten championships, and was named outstanding wrestler at the  Division I NWCA/Cliff Keen National Duals. Including the two individual national champions, the team had a total of seven All-Americans and six Academic All-Big Ten wrestlers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the wrestling program starting in 1911, the current University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team has built upon past successes to continue the team's and school's winning tradition. As wrestling fans know, much of this past success was made possible by the leadership of former head coach and Olympic gold medalist Dan Gable, who continues to provide guidance and leadership to the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to the entire University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team, the University of Iowa, the city of Iowa City, and to my home State of Iowa for this great victory.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 1100, congratulating the University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the program began in 1911, the University of Iowa wrestling team has had a rich tradition and a history of producing champions and outstanding collegiate athletes and coaches, and this year proved to be no different as the top-ranked Hawkeyes wrestling team clinched its 21st national team title in the NCAA championships. In addition to the team title, the Hawkeyes also crowned two national championships, Mark Perry and Brent Metcalf; seven All-Americans; and six Academic All-Big Ten wrestlers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the helm of this outstanding team sits Head Coach Tom Brands, who was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year and the National Wrestling Coaches Association's Coach of the Year. Coach Brands, a former Hawkeyes wrestler, 1996 Olympic gold medalist, and four time All-American, is in his second season as head wrestling coach at the University of Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former head coach and Olympic gold medalist Dan Gable should also be commended for his leadership and guidance provided to the current 2008 championship team. Throughout his tenure, Coach Gable helped establish one of the most successful wrestling programs in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Iowa wrestling team has brought honor to themselves, but I would be remiss if I failed to also recognize the university for its outstanding commitment as a public university. Established in 1847, Iowa has won international recognition for its wealth of achievements in the arts, sciences, and humanities. Iowa was the first United States public university to admit men and women on an equal basis and the first institution of higher education in the Nation to accept creative work  in theater, writing, music, and art as theses for advanced degrees. It established the first law school and the first educational radio station west of the Mississippi, broadcast the world's first educational television programs, and developed and continues to hold preeminence in educational testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to the University's president, Sally Mason; Athletics Director Gary Barta; Head Coach Tom Brands and his staff; all the hardworking wrestlers; their fans; and the entire University of Iowa community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to join with my distinguished colleague Representative Loebsack in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Representative Loebsack from Iowa, and the entire Iowa delegation, as well as all of the Members of the House in congratulating the University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team for their victory in the 2008 NCAA Division I national wrestling championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 22, college wrestling fans were treated to an exceptional wrestling match as the top-ranked University of Iowa won its 21st national team title and crowned two individual national champions, Mark Perry and Brent Metcalf. Three of the Hawkeyes' seven All-Americans competed in the finals in St. Louis for a combined team score of 117.5 points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to coach Tom Brands, who returned to his alma mater and led the team to a perfect 8-0 conference record in his second season as head coach. Impressive feats such as these are why Coach Brands was named Coach of the Year by both the Big Ten Conference and the National Wrestling Coaches Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations also are in order for senior Mark Perry, who overcame a knee injury to win his second national title. He is only the 14th University of Iowa wrestler to earn two national titles. Additionally, Perry rounded out his final year with his fourth All-American honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other individual national title winner was sophomore Brent Metcalf. Metcalf ended the season on an impressive 23-match winning streak and earned many accolades, including the Dan Hodge Trophy, Big Ten Wrestler of the Year, and Outstanding Wrestler at both the NCAA and Big Ten championships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling program began in 1911 and has produced a rich history of champions. With 32 Big Ten conference championships and 21 NCAA Division I national championships, the Hawkeyes wrestling team is a premier program. The extraordinary achievement of this season is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the many wrestlers, coaches, students, alumni, families, and fans that have helped to make the University of Iowa a wrestling powerhouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning the national championship, finishing the season with a 21-1 overall dual record, and winning the Big Ten conference championship for the 32nd time has brought national acclaim to the University of Iowa. I know the fans of the university will revel in this accomplishment as they look forward to the 2009 season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, once again I congratulate the University of Iowa for their tremendous success.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400234" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Iowa Men's Wrestling Program on winning the 2008 NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dating back to the early 1900's my home State of Iowa has lead the way in shaping what competitive collegiate wrestling has become today. In fact, the first ever NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championship Tournament took place in Ames, Iowa. Anyone who follows the sport will tell you that you can always count on a team from the State of Iowa finishing among the top of almost every tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At all levels, the State of Iowa has a long storied and honored wrestling tradition and it is the preferred sport of many Iowa households. It has been a hallmark of Iowa athletics for decades and its competition remains prominent in the majority of middle schools, high schools, state colleges and universities throughout the state today. There is a tremendous amount of hard-work, discipline and dedication required to succeed in wrestling, common characteristics of all Iowans which may explain  why we have been so successful in the sport for so long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Iowa's wrestling program has significantly contributed to this success and tradition. It has historically been, and remains, considered among the nation's elite programs. In 2008 the University of Iowa won its 21st national title, its first since 2000, and crowned two individual champions--senior Mark Perry and sophomore Brent Metcalf. And, Coach Tom Brands was selected as 2008 Coach of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I wish to congratulate the Iowa wrestling program on a job well done as they celebrate their 2008 national championship and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well by adopting this resolution.</paragraph>
