  <narrative>NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8282]</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to House Resolution 1434 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, <bill type="h" number="6842">H.R. 6842</bill>.</chair>
  <chair/>
  <chair>Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (<bill type="h" number="6842">H.R. 6842</bill>) to require the District of Columbia to revise its laws regarding the use and possession of firearms as necessary to comply with the requirements of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, in a manner that protects the security interests of the Federal government and the people who work in, reside in,  or visit the District of Columbia and does not undermine the efforts of law enforcement, homeland security, and military officials to protect the Nation's capital from crime and terrorism, with Mr. Altmire (Acting Chairman) in the chair.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the bill.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first and foremost, I think it is imperative that we understand that the security and safety of our Nation's capitol should be of vital importance to all Americans, not simply the residents of the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My dear colleague and District of Columbia Representative, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton along with Congressman Henry Waxman of California, drafted comprehensive and sensible firearm legislation which the Childers/Souder amendment not only eviscerates but allows residents and federal officials to places in immense danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Childers/Souder Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute completely destroys the sensible Norton/Waxman Home Rule bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dangerous consequences include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No gun registration to let the police know who has guns and to trace guns used in crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No regulation of guns, only a bare federal statute resulting in one of the most permissive gun laws in the Nation--post 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No age limit for possession of guns, including military-style weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Permits a person who is voluntarily committed to a mental institution to own a gun the day after he gets out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal law forbids a person to cross State lines to purchase a gun and bring it back, but this makes an exception uniquely for District residents to cross State lines to purchase guns and bring them back from Maryland and Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requires a "gun show loophole," which avoids background checks in the nation's capital, i.e., District of Columbia residents can purchase weapons from private individuals and at gun shows without background checks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The District of Columbia (the District) is a local self-governing jurisdiction and the seat of the United States Government, with unique Federal responsibilities. It is here that the President, the Vice President, and many cabinet and other Federal officials reside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unregulated firearms in the capital would preclude the ability of the District Metropolitan Police Department to track guns through registration and otherwise help ensure that guns do not endanger Federal officials and employees, visiting dignitaries, and other individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The revised firearm legislation requires the District within 6 months after enactment, to revise its laws governing the possession and use of firearms as necessary to comply with the decision of the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller. It also amends the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 by adding a new section requiring the Mayor and the Council of the District to ensure that the District's firearms laws are consistent with Heller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Heller, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the Second Amendment to the Constitution protects an individual's right to possess a firearm, irrespective of service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense within the home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decision in Heller affirmed the holding in Parker v. District of Columbia, wherein the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia declared three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act to be unconstitutional: D.C. Code &#xA7;7-2502.02, which generally barred the registration of handguns; &#xA7;22-4504, which prohibited carrying a pistol without a license, insofar as that provision would prevent a registrant from moving a gun from one room to another within his or her  home; and &#xA7;7-2507.02, which required that all lawfully owned firearms be kept unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Addressing the holding in Parker, the Supreme Court noted that the District's approach "totally bans handgun possession in the home." The Court then declared that the inherent right of self-defense is central to the Second Amendment right, and that the District's handgun ban amounted to a prohibition of an entire class of arms that has been overwhelmingly utilized by American society for that purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court also struck down as unconstitutional the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock, as such a requirement "makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right here in America according to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, Harvard School of Public Health approximately</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2,500 black youth (aged 15-24) die annually from gun homicide, 950 Hispanic youths and 600 white youth. For gun suicides, it's about 1,600 white youths annually, 300 black youths and 200 Hispanic youths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 20 percent and 50 percent of children in the United States are touched by violence, either as victims or, even more commonly, as witnesses. And sadly for every child killed by a gun, four are injured according to the national estimates of nonfatal firearm-related injuries by the Journal of the American Medical Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the U.S., the leading cause of death for African-Americans ages 15-24 and 25-34 is homicide, with the overwhelming majority (90 percent and 87 percent, respectively) committed with firearms. Homicide is the second leading cause of death for African-Americans ages 10-14, with firearm-related deaths accounting for 70 percent of these deaths.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day in Texas someone dies or is severely injured as a result of gun violence. Texans die from suicide, accidents, and crime. In 2004, 2,342 people died from firearm-related injuries in Texas. We hear about these deaths every day: depressed teenagers and spouses taking their own lives, children finding a loaded gun at a friend's house, gun related crime, etc. We hear about it so often; we have become numb to it and feel nothing can be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we speak of dignitaries, members of Congress, and the executive--the fact is that it is our children that are most at risk. We cannot allow a vague interpretation of the Second Amendment to put our children at risk and move guns on our streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our young African-American and Hispanic men who are frequently caught up in this system. Among youth ages 15-24, firearms rank as the leading cause of death for African-Americans and the second leading cause of death for whites and Hispanic youth. With over 5,049 federally licensed firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in Texas alone, how many more guns on our streets do we need?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman I urge my colleagues to think about the safe of our children. Is there not already enough violence? For all the firearms in Afghanistan and Iraq is it helping them? Do more guns on our streets make them safer? I think we all know the answer is a resounding "no." I am not asking that we remove all firearms from the hands of every responsible and  law-abiding American, but I ask that we support sensible and comprehensive firearm legislation  such as the Norton/Waxman approach.</paragraph>

  <chair> When the Committee of the Whole rose on Tuesday, September 16, 2008, a request for a recorded vote on the amendment printed in House Report 110-852 by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Childers) had been postponed.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the amendment is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Amendment offered by Mr. Childers:</narrative>
  <narrative> Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Second Amendment Enforcement Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) As the Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States have recognized, the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the rights of individuals, including those who are not members of a militia or engaged in military service or training, to keep and bear arms.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of their persons, homes, businesses, and families.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and their loved ones in their own homes and businesses.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide comprehensive Federal regulations applicable in the District of Columbia as elsewhere. In addition, existing District of Columbia criminal laws punish possession and illegal use of firearms by violent criminals and felons. Consequently, there is no need for local laws which only affect and disarm law-abiding citizens.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Officials of the District of Columbia have indicated their intention to continue to unduly restrict lawful firearm possession and use by citizens of the District.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Legislation is required to correct the District of Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of its citizens under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. REFORM D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT FIREARMS.</narrative>
  <narrative> Section 4 of the Act entitled "An Act to prohibit the killing of wild birds and wild animals in the District of Columbia", approved June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 809; sec. 1-303.43, D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end the following: "Nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall authorize, or shall be construed to permit, the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or regulatory authority of the District of Columbia to prohibit, constructively prohibit, or unduly burden  the ability of persons not prohibited from possessing firearms under Federal law from acquiring, possessing in their homes or businesses, or using for sporting, self-protection or other lawful purposes, any firearm neither prohibited by Federal law nor subject to the National Firearms Act. The District of Columbia shall not have authority to enact laws or regulations</narrative>
  <narrative> "(10) `Machine gun' means any firearm which shoots, is designed to shoot, or readily restored to shoot automatically, more than 1 shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger, and includes the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun, and any combination of parts from which a machine gun can be assembled if such parts are in  the possession or under the control of a person.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Conforming Amendment to Provisions Setting Forth Criminal Penalties.--Section 1(c) of the Act of July 8, 1932 (47 Stat. 651; sec. 22-4501(c), D.C.

  <narrative>So the amendment was agreed to.</narrative>
  <narrative>The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.</narrative>
  <narrative>Stated for:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412216" topic="NOT VOTING--17">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today I was unexpectedly detained and unable to vote on the Childers Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to <bill type="h" number="6842">H.R. 6842</bill>, the National Capital Security and Safety Act (Roll No. 600.) Had I been present I would have voted "aye."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="NOT VOTING--17">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6842">H.R. 6842</bill>, The Second Amendment Enforcement Act. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court rightly overturned the unconstitutional gun ban enforced by the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court recognized what Tennesseans have always known, that the second amendment applies to individuals, and that all law-abiding Americans have an inherent right to self-defense. The ruling was a victory for freedom and constitutional rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, the District of Columbia has chosen to turn a blind eye to the court and the constitution by re-legislating the gun ban piece by piece. DC has legislated that guns must be trigger locked or disassembled in the home, rendering it nearly impossible for law-abiding citizens from purchasing guns in the District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the court overturned the ban, I breathed a sigh of relief for the young women on my staff who are now able to appropriately defend themselves. Imagine my surprise when the District dictated that those same staffers store their guns in pieces or with trigger locks until an "immediate" threat presents itself. Have you ever heard of anything so ridiculous? When a threat is immediate, you don't have time to find a key or put together a gun!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand for the right of all Americans to defend themselves and in support of <bill type="h" number="6842">H.R. 6842</bill>, which will make the policy of the District of Columbia consistent with the ruling of the court and the clear intent of the Constitution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="NOT VOTING--17">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate legislative responsibility for the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, through enactment of the DC Home Rule Act Congress has authorized the residents of the District to elect a Mayor and City Council to be responsible for the day-to-day exercise of that authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respect the intent of home rule because I think residents of Washington, DC--like residents of Colorado--should be able to govern themselves so far as consistent with the ability of the Federal Government to function.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think this principle of home rule for DC is made all the more important because the residents of the District are not fully represented here in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I have some hesitation supporting legislation that would in effect shape policies for the District of Columbia without the involvement of its elected officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am supporting <bill type="h" number="6842">H.R. 6842</bill> today because any flaws in its approach can be corrected as the legislative process continues and because I think it is needed in order to send a strong message to the District government to move promptly to revise its laws to reflect the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case of DC v. Heller and thus to assure that the second amendment rights of the District's residents are not infringed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the purpose of this legislation--one that I support, because complying with our oath to support and defend the Constitution is the first duty of all Members of Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="NOT VOTING--17">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Childers amendment to the National Capital Security and Safety Act is deeply flawed. We continue to treat the residents of the District of Columbia as members of a colony, hampering their ability to govern themselves. We ought not to have Congress be the State legislature or city council for 580,000 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the tens of thousands of Oregonians who visit our Nation's capital each year, traveling with their children to experience America's history and culture, and as someone who lives in DC for 30 percent of the year and has worked with victims of gun violence, this legislation is neither comforting nor sound policy. The imposition on local government would throw out all locally approved gun safety measures, including handgun registration and the semiautomatic ban, and even go as far as removing  all age restrictions on gun purchase, permitting a 6-year-old to purchase a deadly weapon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is best for Congress not to do the National Rifle Association's bidding, forcing DC to be their showcase for eliminating all boundaries of gun safety. I urge my colleagues to respect home rule and common sense.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Under the rule, the Committee rises.</chair>
  <chair>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Pastor) having assumed the chair, Mr. Altmire, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="6842">H.R. 6842</bill>) to require the District of Columbia to revise its laws regarding the use and possession of firearms as necessary to comply with the requirements of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of District  of Columbia v. Heller, in a manner that protects the security interests of the Federal Government and the people who work in, reside in, or visit the District of Columbia and does not undermine the efforts of law enforcement, homeland security, and military officials to protect the Nation's Capital from crime and terrorism, pursuant to House Resolution 1434, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.</chair>
  <chair> Under the rule, the previous question is ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The question is on the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The amendment was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.</chair>
  <chair> The question is on the passage of the bill.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>
