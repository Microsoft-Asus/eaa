  <narrative>Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a dependable, caring adult provides guidance, support, and encouragement to facilitate a young person's social, emotional, and cognitive development;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas continued research on mentoring shows that formal, high-quality mentoring focused on developing the competence and character of the mentee promotes positive outcomes, such as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, social skills, and career development;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas further research on mentoring provides strong evidence that mentoring successfully reduces substance use and abuse, academic failure, and delinquency;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas mentoring, in addition to preparing young people for school, work, and life, is extremely rewarding for those serving as mentors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas more than 4,200 mentoring programs in communities of all sizes across the United States focus on building strong, effective relationships between mentors and mentees;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United States are in solid mentoring relationships due to the remarkable vigor, creativity, and resourcefulness of the thousands of mentoring programs in communities throughout the Nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in spite of the progress made to increase mentoring, the Nation has a serious "mentoring gap", with nearly 15,000,000 young people in need of mentors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and private sectors bring State and local leaders together to support mentoring programs by preventing duplication of efforts, offering training in industry best practices, and making the most of limited resources to benefit young people in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the designation of January 2009 as National Mentoring Month will help call attention to the critical role mentors play in helping young people realize their potential;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will encourage more individuals and organizations, including schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in mentoring across the United States; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas National Mentoring Month will, most significantly, build awareness of mentoring and encourage more people to become mentors and help close the mentoring gap in the United States: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) designates the month of January 2009 as "National Mentoring Month";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the millions of caring adults and students who are already volunteering as mentors and encourages more adults and students to volunteer as mentors; and</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 728--DESIGNATING JANUARY 2009 AS &quot;NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH&quot;">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Kennedy and others to submit <bill type="sr" number="728">S. Res. 728</bill>, which designates January 2009 as National Mentoring Month. Mentoring a child is a uniquely rewarding experience for both the mentor and the child. Research continues to support that building these positive relationships helps keep children off of drugs, in school and off the streets, and out of trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month, I brought the Senate Judiciary Committee to St. Albans, VT, for a field hearing about "Community-Based Solutions to Drug-Related Crime in Rural America." Community leaders and law enforcement officials testified about their efforts to address crime. They are on the front lines fighting crime each and every day. I have always said that solving these problems as they arise is essential, but preventing them is even better. One solution that Vermont's businesses, schools, college students,  and retired people have continued to recognize is that mentoring connects our community to our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vermont's mentoring programs stretch the length of our great State, from the Northeast Kingdom to Bennington. Whether it is the Boys and Girls Clubs offering healthy alternatives for young people, or organizations such as DREAM, which connects college students and children living in subsidized housing developments, or any of the several mentoring programs in the State, these organizations and the dedicated people who operate and participate in them deserve our special thanks. I applaud all the  work mentoring programs are doing to help our Nation's children become productive, law-abiding teenagers and contributing adults. Recognizing those efforts during National Mentoring Month is just one way we give our thanks.</paragraph>
