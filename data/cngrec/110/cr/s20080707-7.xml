  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JESSE HELMS -- (Senate - July 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6344">S6344</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend, the majority leader. Let me just add, Jesse and Dot Helms were good friends of Elaine's and mine and good friends of a lot of other people in the Senate on both sides. There are a significant number of our conference planning to attend the funeral tomorrow. I thank the majority leader for his accommodation of those requests by having the votes on Wednesday morning. At Dot Helms' request, I will be doing one of the eulogies tomorrow at the funeral, and  I will have more to say about the life of my good friend Jesse Helms when I get back. But I wish to echo the remarks of the majority leader about what a fine gentleman he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you took a poll around here of the pages and the people who work in the Capitol about who was the most popular Member, I expect Jesse Helms would have won it--which would surprise an awful lot of people in the press and out in America who thought of Senator Helms as sort of a fierce individual. In fact, in person, he was as gentle, as accommodating, and as friendly as anybody I have ever met. We all will miss Jesse Helms a great deal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the majority leader for giving me an opportunity to make some comments at this point about our good friend Jesse Helms.</paragraph>
