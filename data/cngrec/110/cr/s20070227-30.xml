    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Mary Burks, founder of the Alabama Conservancy, mother of the wilderness movement, and champion of the Sipsey Wilderness in the Bankhead National Forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, Mary Burks passed away in Birmingham, at the age of 86.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her passing is a loss, not just for Alabama or the conservation movement, but for every person who has ever explored and enjoyed Alabama's vast wilderness. She helped protect those natural areas, and, without her, our children might not be as able to enjoy them as they do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her lifelong struggle to protect and conserve sensitive lands provides a record of accomplishment that deserves both recognition and celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Randolph, author of a book titled The Battle for Alabama Wilderness, described Mary Burks's passion for what she did. Randolph says, "If one believes in fate, then surely Mary Burks was fated to become the mother of Alabama wilderness preservation. Passionate, tough, and resilient, a lover of all things wild and natural ....."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary Burks did not simply sit and dream. She led a 6-year campaign in the early 1970s to designate the Sipsey Wilderness area in the Bankhead National Forest as wilderness. In doing so, she won the support of the entire Alabama congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not always an easy thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the campaign, not only was the Sipsey Wilderness created, but the Eastern Wilderness Area System was established when President Gerald Ford signed the Eastern Wilderness Act. It is fair to assume that this success would not have been achieved without Mary Burks' tireless efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Alabama is home to more than 41,000 acres of wilderness, including the Cheaha and Dugger Mountain Wilderness Areas. As you know, hundreds of thousands of acres have now been designated as wilderness in the Eastern United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these accomplishments have roots in Mary Burks's original push to preserve wilderness in Alabama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Describing the importance of Mary's efforts and the organization that she founded, the Alabama Conservancy, Floyd Haskell, former U.S. Senator from Colorado, stated "If not for the Alabama Conservancy, there would be no concept of Eastern Wilderness."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a difference between thinking that things ought to be a certain way, and actually making them so. Too often we are quick to do the former, and slow to do the latter. But the protected resources in my home State and others are larger in size, great in quantity, and more secure in their protection because Mary Burks fought for them all her life. She left a lasting legacy in Alabama that will forever be felt by all who care about wilderness and natural places.</paragraph>
