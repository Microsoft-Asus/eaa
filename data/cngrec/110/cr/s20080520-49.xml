    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the close to 4 years of dedicated service and leadership provided by Dr. Timothy White, outgoing president of the University of Idaho. Son of immigrants from Argentina to Canada and then to the United States, Dr. White is a first-generation college graduate. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and is known internationally for his work in kinesiology, gerontology and human biodynamics, working in those fields at  the University of Michigan and at Berkeley. Before coming to Idaho in August 2004, Dr. White served as provost and executive vice president at Oregon State University and as interim president.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. White put his vision of excellence in research, math and science into practice at the University of Idaho. Indeed, he shares my strong belief in the critical importance of math and science to education, from primary school to graduate degree programs. In a recent guest editorial, Dr. White stated: "Idaho will prosper in the global economy if our work force is better prepared in the areas of math, science, technology and engineering Critical-thinking and reasoning abilities--cornerstones  of an educated citizenry and work force--are also dramatically aided by strong math and science skills." And Dr. White put ideas into action, overseeing critical programs that bridge the gap between middle and high school teachers and students and the University. While serving as president, Dr. White oversaw both the Gateway to Mathematics Program, which provides middle school teachers the chance to improve math teaching skills through interactive distance technology, and the Gateway</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. White's influence reached beyond math and science programs and initiatives. He created the Plan for Renewal of People, Programs and Place, based on the report of a task force he established to reinforce and enhance the university's academic and institutional excellence in today's world. The plan centered the University's resource allocation and mission, vision, and values around five key academic areas: science and technology, liberal arts and sciences, entrepreneurial innovation, the environment,  and sustainable design and lifestyle. He saw the university engage in programs such as Operation Education Scholarship, Water of the West, Building Sustainable Communities, Bioregional Planning and Community Design and Biological Applications of Nanotechnology. During his term as president, the University of Idaho has been involved in many public-private partnerships with science and technology across the State, particularly in agriculture research. In 2006, the university opened an aquaculture biotechnology laboratory at its Hagerman fish culture experiment station, and University scientists now conduct cutting edge small grains germplasm research together with USDA Agriculture Research Service</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. White has worked diligently over the past 4 years to adapt the University of Idaho to our changing world,  meeting students' educational needs and keeping the university on the cutting edge of innovative education, research, and academic excellence. I wish Tim and his wife Karen all the best as they move to southern California and he assumes the chancellorship of University of California, Riverside, this fall.</paragraph>
