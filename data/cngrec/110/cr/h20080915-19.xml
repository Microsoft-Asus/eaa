    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 390, honoring the 28th Infantry Division. I join my colleagues in recognition of the brave men and women who have answered the call of duty and contributed in so many ways to our Nation's safety and security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history of the 28th Infantry Division is truly remarkable and a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of those who have served in the division. Officially established way back in 1879, the 28th Infantry Division is one of the oldest divisions in the Army. Its roots trace back to the Revolutionary War era to units in Benjamin Franklin's battalion of Associators in Philadelphia, as well as General George Washington's Continental Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In World War I, the 28th Infantry Division fought in six major campaigns: Champagne, Champagne-Marne, Oise-Marne, Lorraine, and Meuse-Argonne. They paid greatly for their efforts, losing over 14,000 men. Recognizing its tough and relentless fighting prowess,  General of the Armies John J. Pershing labeled the 28th Infantry Division the Iron Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Second World War, the division fought some of the fiercest battles in the European theater. Perhaps most notably during the Battle of the Bulge, the 28th Infantry Division held its ground against overwhelming German forces until Allied reinforcements arrived. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten, and the importance of their victory as a turning point in World War II remains etched in the history of this division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the 28th Infantry Division is an active National Guard division, with armories in towns and cities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division have served and are currently serving abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan, and were also recently deployed in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of the NATO peacekeeping missions. Since September 11, over 10,000 soldiers of the division have deployed overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women of the 28th Infantry Division serve their community selflessly while balancing full-time careers and families. Through the years, their names and faces have changed, but the commitment and the dedication with which they serve our Nation remains the hallmark of the 28th Infantry Division.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am very proud to join my colleagues in honoring these men and women, past and present, and to express my sincere gratitude for their sacrifice to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation. And I urge my colleagues to vote for the adoption of this resolution that recognizes our citizen soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 390, as amended, which honors the 28th Infantry Division for serving and protecting the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to pay tribute to the current and former members of the 28th Infantry Division, the Keystone Division, who have steadfastly and courageously defended and served this great country on our own shores and in distant lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>With roots that date back to the Continental Army, the 28th Infantry Division fought valiantly in several campaigns during World War I, earning the title "Iron Division" from General John J. Pershing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, during World War II, victory was won in hard-fought battles in places like the Huertgen Forest on the western front and in the Battle of the Bulge because of the tenacity and the perseverance of the brave soldiers of the 28th Infantry Division. These battles earned them another title, Bloody Buckets, this time given to them by German forces because of the fury of the 28th Infantry Division assaults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More recently, the 28th Infantry Division has participated in Operation Desert Storm, deployed troops to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan, and has played a vital role in the successes of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Closer to home, Mr. Speaker, the Division has responded in the aftermath of natural disasters to provide aid and comfort to fellow Americans during hurricanes, blizzards and devastating floods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that the soldiers of the Division have distinguished themselves by earning 10 Medals of Honor, four Legions of Merit, and 258 Silver Stars for their outstanding service to the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the valiant service of the 28th Infantry Division has not come without enormous sacrifice. Throughout its history, the members of the Division have paid the price to ensure our freedom. Still today there are over 2,600 soldiers from the 28th Infantry Division missing in action in both world wars of the 20th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if I did not also pay tribute today to the incredible families of these brave soldiers, who waited at home while their loved ones answered our Nation's call, I would be remiss. The entire Nation owes the soldiers and veterans of the 28th Infantry Division and their families a debt of gratitude. We are all proud of their service. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to make a few brief remarks on the issue of energy because we seem to discuss that. And I have no further speakers at that point and I will be prepared to yield back to my friend from Guam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think today in the discussion of three bills we've seen a terrifically orderly process of cooperation between the two sides as we have come together to honor and recognize Americans who have distinguished themselves in service to our country and in service to one another. And it's been a process that I think ought to epitomize all of our openings. Our problem, unfortunately, is we don't always have that process in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've known for many, many years that we had a very serious energy crisis. I believe former Secretary of the Treasury, John Connelly, first pointed that out as long ago as 1970 when we were importing about 24 percent of petroleum from overseas. Former President Carter called it the moral equivalent of war that we confront and deal with this crisis in the late 1970s. And there certainly have been fitful efforts by both sides of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, to try and come to grips with this problem  over the years, but we all know we have not done it successfully. And I think perhaps that's because we have not done it together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point to the efforts of two of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Abercrombie from Hawaii and Mr. Peterson from Pennsylvania, who have tried to work together to formulate a bipartisan solution to parts of this vexing problem as an example that all of us on both sides ought to follow, Mr. Speaker. I think if we did, we would do better. And I think we could come up with legislation that would genuinely make a difference because nothing is more important, aside  from our physical security, than our economic security. And I think we all recognize we're at the point, Mr. Speaker, that that security is threatened by an overdependence on foreign energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can go a long way, we can do a lot together. Sometimes when we work together we do do extraordinary things. So I would challenge the House that in the coming week, when we discuss this important issue, that that's, indeed, how we proceed, we bring bills to the floor, we have open debate, and we try to find common ground with one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again I would like to go on record to thank my co-manager of the bill, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, <bill type="hc" number="390">H. Con. Res. 390</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400077" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>
