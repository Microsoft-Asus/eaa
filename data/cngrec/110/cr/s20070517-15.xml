  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, over the coming week the Senate has a historic opportunity to move forward with tough, smart, and fair comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, that ensures our economy continues to thrive, that protects American workers, and that at the same time undoes the process of committing millions of people to languish in the darkness and be exploited, or we can choose to abdicate our responsibilities and tacitly maintain the status quo of failed laws and  a broken immigration system that is weak enforcement, that leaves our borders and our citizens unsecured and at the same time permits human exploitation to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a group, several Senators, including myself, have been meeting and negotiating on comprehensive immigration reform over the past couple of months. I appreciate the President making Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Gutierrez available to try to reach an agreement that would do those things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have come, during the course of that process with other colleagues, to a better understanding of my colleagues and their thoughts on this issue through the many hours we have spent talking together about solving the immigration problems, though I have not always agreed with them. I would like to believe our discussions were serious, thorough, and in good faith. At times they were productive, at other times they hit obstacles, but when one considers the enormity of the task at hand, along with  what is at stake, one would have to be naive in thinking this would be an easy process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing we know for sure is that beginning next week, if cloture is invoked, an immigrating bill, in some form, will be considered on the floor of the Senate. I sincerely appreciate the commitment in regard to the time spent and the thought invested on this issue from all sides involved. The amount of work that has been put into this effort represents the interest level, not to mention the stakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say, however, that in large part, part of the problem in getting agreement this year was where the administration started off in their proposal, which acted as a marker in these negotiations. From the minute I saw that proposal, it was clear to me we were no longer where we were last year on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, we passed a bipartisan bill, one that a majority of Americans could get behind. It was a historic effort that joined 23 Republicans with 39 Democrats to address an issue of urgent national importance. The bill is the basis of what Majority Leader Reid has scheduled a cloture vote for next Monday afternoon. I do hope we will be able to get a vote to be able to continue to proceed. I appreciate the majority leader making this issue a priority, having given us 2 months of lead  time, telling us a very significant part of the Senate's calendar was being reserved for this debate. I appreciate his leadership in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, unfortunately, the administration, along with several of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, decided to radically alter their views and began the process this year with a far more impractical, in my mind, far more partisan proposal. Evidently, the White House convinced itself that it must have the support of some Republican Senators who opposed and worked to defeat last year's bill in order to pass something this year. Therefore, the White House has proposed an immigration  reform plan that is far to the right of the Senate's passed bill of a year ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you what I believe the principles should be as to how the Senate should guide itself as it debates next week. I believe any immigration reform we pass must be tough in terms of the security of our country, it must be fair, it must be workable, it must be comprehensive in nature; that preserves, among other things, family values, keeps us safe as a country, rewards hard work and sacrifice, benefits all Americans, and promotes safe, legal, and orderly immigration. Now, I could not sign  on to the agreement announced in principle earlier today because, in my mind, it does not meet the principles I just described.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to just state that very briefly in Spanish.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>(Speaking in Spanish.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, what I just said is I could not sign on to the agreement announced in principle because it tears families apart, and it says to many that they are only good enough to work here but not good enough to stay. Depending upon the category of individuals, it levies rather high penalties and fines, and it does not provide the confidentiality or judicial review necessary to bring those people who are undocumented in the country out of the shadows and into the light.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I have serious concerns about the workability and the fairness of the  agreement announced earlier because, first and foremost, it tears at the fabric of family  reunification by limiting and eliminating the ability of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to petition for their children, their parents, and siblings to join them in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I took it very much to heart when President Bush said family values don't stop at the Rio Grande, that we all share those family values. Yet here we are with a piece of legislation which I gather is largely supported by the White House which undermines the very essence of that. Even under a new point structure that is envisioned under this bill, it seems to me the essence of family could get much more weighty within the context of a whole new process of how we are going to move our immigration  system forward. Family is a critical value--I thought--in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It calls for a truly temporary and, I am concerned, potentially Bracero-style worker program that labor ultimately will not support and that could repeat the same problem all over, having us face this challenge in the years ahead by the way it is devised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does not have confidentiality and judicial review, at least not of the standard I have seen to date; it is still one of those floating things out there. The reality is, if we want people to come out of the shadows into the light, to know who is here to pursue the American dream versus who is here to destroy it, then we need to be able to have those individuals understand that they will, in fact, and should come forth so that, in fact, they can go through the process envisioned by the framework  agreement but that they will have confidentiality and judicial review in the process. Without addressing those issues, the system that would be created under the proposal would do little to fix our broken immigration system in the long term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I support fines for those who have broken the law. But the fines that are proposed are prohibitive, and they make a pathway to legalization a path in name only. A family of four would have to pay $10,000 in fines and fees, which is more than last year's bill even after it was amended twice on the floor to increase those fines. That does not even include the cost of their trip to "touch back" when they seek to become a permanent resident. Unable to pay these fines and fees, some of the  undocumented workers will be unable to come out of the shadows and into the light of American's progress and promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Giving people the opportunity to come out of the shadows is an essential and necessary component of immigration reform because it will allow us to recognize who is here to seek the American dream versus who is here to destroy it through criminal or terrorist acts such as those which were recently almost carried out at Fort Dix in my home State of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we had the right set of standards, which I envision us having in our bill, and people would come forward, we would have caught those individuals by the background checks we would have conducted. But for those people to come forth, obviously, there has to be some sense that in fact there is a real opportunity; otherwise, no one will come forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also propose virtually doing away with provision for family reunification which has been the bedrock of our immigration policy throughout our history. This idea not only changes the spirit of our immigration policy, it also emphasizes the family structure. If this system had been in place when my mother and father attempted to come to this country, they certainly would not have qualified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have listened to the stories of so many of our fellow colleagues in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, I know many of their parents would never have qualified to come to this country. I would like to think that they made, and continue to make, some very significant contributions to our Nation. It seems to me a new paradigm could have been structured where family values and reunification have more of a fighting chance than under the framework agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As for the temporary worker program, we are inviting in temporary workers but, of course, we expect them to leave. Yes, temporary is temporary, and we are going to rotate them through, but how we do that and what pathway at the end of the day we might provide for saying you are human capital is incredibly important to this country. As if you perform enough of it, there may be an opportunity for you to adjust your status. But the way that the framework document envisions, it can simply create  another undocumented workforce. It also sends the message that there are some people good enough to work here but not good enough to stay here; there are others good enough to work here and to stay here. If one didn't know what year it was, one might think we were discussing the National Origins Act of 1924. These and other problems with the proposed deal have to be improved to be able to support the type of reform that will meet the principles I have outlined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Generally speaking, it seems to me we have taken a radical departure from what we were able to collectively achieve last year. We need to take a hard look at it as we open the debate next week. For the sake of much needed reform, many Democrats, including myself, showed a willingness, even more than I would have envisioned, to make strides toward the White House's proposal. Even so there are certain issues where too much bend ultimately creates an impractical and ineffective immigration system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, that is what I believe will occur under the agreement announced earlier this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, cannot settle for something that isn't sufficiently responsible in terms of meeting these values--security of the country, making sure we deal with our economy in a way that doesn't depress wages but at the same time realizes certain economic sectors need help and preserves family values, and at the same time makes sure we end the exploitation that often takes place when those people are languishing in the darkness. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be fair, humane,  and practical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the magic of our Constitution is that it eventually allows the better parts of our nature to prevail. The better part of our national character is found in the strength we have achieved through our diversity. But that better nature must be fought for and fostered; in my mind, one of the greatest parts of America's experiment that has made it the great country that it is. I look forward to leading efforts on the floor of the Senate that will strengthen our security, protect American workers,  deal with the necessities of our economy, while at the same time upholding the promise and the value of the American story that we hold so dear. We need to improve the framework document that has been announced through the legislative process next week. This is too important an issue to allow partisan politics to play a role. It is too important an issue to only be concerned about appeasing a relatively small part of a political base that is unrepresentative of the American public at large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must come together not as Democrats and Republicans, or liberals and conservatives, but as statesmen and, in doing so, honor the traditions of the Senate as a body that values reasoning, honest debate, and compromise over sound bites, talking points, fear, and smear tactics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know in my heart this is possible. I pray that it is practical and that we can end up with a bill next week that does these things: secures our country in a meaningful way and at the same time makes sure that we can preserve the economic interests of our country in all of the different aspects of our economy; that can say that the promise of family values we hold so dear and that has been at the core for over four decades of our immigration system can continue to be a reality; that we can end  the human exploitation of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>people within our country, and in doing so, we actually make our country safer, more secure, and more robust in its economy. That is where I hope to lead efforts on the Senate floor next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the work that has been done by the Senators who have agreed to the framework agreement. I just believe it falls too short in some of the key principles for me to be supportive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am looking forward to a bill on which we can join together and say: We did the best for the Nation. We did what is humanely right. We did what is right for the Nation in terms of its security and its economy, and we have  preserved the very essence of what this Nation has been about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my home State of New Jersey, which was a gateway to millions of people across this country, particularly during the period of Ellis Island, we can almost touch Lady Liberty. Ellis Island is a short bridge walk across. The reality is that because of those people who have contributed so dramatically to our country, we all have a relationship to immigration--whether you can trace your history to the Mayflower and the voyage of that first opportunity, whether you are part of the Daughters of  the American Revolution, whether you came with the millions in the European experience that crossed a great ocean through Ellis Island and then throughout our country, whether you came, as my parents did, in search of freedom, the reality is, we all have a connection. Let's honor that connection in a way that meets these values. Let' meet that challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can do so next week as the Senate convenes on this historic debate. I look forward to that opportunity.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400621" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wanted to have an opportunity to speak for a moment on this very timely issue of immigration. I heard my colleague from New Jersey speaking. I know how hard he has worked with us to try to achieve a solution to this very difficult problem the country has faced for now over 20 years. I am disappointed that what we did fell short of his hopes. I thought I would take a moment and respond to some of his comments, but also in the hopes of inviting him back into the process  where his support would be so welcome and so vital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I should say there is nothing easy about this issue. There is nothing easy about the solution that we crafted, nor does it claim any sort of perfection associated with it because it is an imperfect bill. But it is a compromise. So what it implies by a compromise is that there are some things in it that I wholeheartedly support. There are some things that I might have liked to have seen differently. At the end of the day, that is how legislation is made. That is how it happens. We all give  a little, and we end up someplace where we can move the country forward and provide the country with a way to resolve this very difficult issue that we call immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the notions I would appreciate dispelling is the fact that this is a White House bill. It is not. This is just as much a Senator Kennedy bill as it is a Senator Kyl bill, and a Senator Martinez bill as it is a Senator Salazar bill. I could name others: Senator Graham, Senator McCain, Senator Isakson. This bill has a great deal of balance because it not only enforces our borders first and foremost, which is what all Americans  want at a time when our shores are threatened by potential terrorists, but it, secondly, does not do any of the other things that will be done in the bill until certain triggers are met, those triggers to have been in place as far as border security is concerned, the hiring of border agents, building the fencing, building of other physical and electronic barriers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we move into another phase which is to provide a tamper-proof ID. This will ensure that those who are working will work legally. It then moves into other areas such as a guest worker program. This is a guest worker program which is a temporary worker program. It is not intended as a vehicle to immigration. It is to provide the labor that America needs in certain places and also to provide a good-paying job to certain people in other parts of the world who want to work here, but with a clear  understanding before ever coming that they are coming to work for a limited period of time, much as a student visa holder comes for 2 years to go to school, coming for 2 years to go to work. Then they go home. They can renew that visa a couple of times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then a number of them will, if they acquire certain prerequisites, apply for permanent status here. Obviously, if they learned English, that would help them. If they learn a trade, that would help them. If their employer says they are a good worker, that would help them. That will be the basis for future immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There still is a family component to immigration. Husband, wife, children, can come, grandparents--40,000 a year of parents can come. What we are going to do is change the paradigm to one where more merit is included in the equation. There will be a point system. Family will often be a tiebreaker. That will be maintained. But the paradigm of immigration will shift to a different one. It will then give the 12 million people who are here today living in the shadows an opportunity to come out of  the shadows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know how anyone can overlook the significance of that act, the fact that this country of immigrants and this country of laws will be generous enough to say to those 12 million that are here, having come illegally to our country but who have worked, as long as they pay fines, as long as they obey the law and have not gotten in trouble, and as long as they are willing to learn the English language, they can have a path forward to stay here and continue to work. If they go back to their  home country, they also can apply for permanent residence and get in back of the line as any fairness would dictate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fines, of course there will be fines. They can be paid over a period of years. They are not exorbitant, and they are only to the head of household. In this bill is the DREAM Act, an incredible achievement for the dream of education. The 12 million people living in the shadows in this country today find oftentimes their future dreams of a college education truncated by the inability to pay the tuition and the out-of-State fees. The DREAM Act is in this bill. That is an important consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of this bill is going to take care of the agricultural needs of the country which is significant. I know in Florida, whether it is agricultural or hotel workers, whether it is theme park workers, in the tourism industry we desperately need workers. There are not enough there today. So the temporary worker program will help our economy while it helps people to have a good and decent job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think there are some things here that are tremendously positive. It is a very exciting day, and I am delighted to be a part of the compromise. Obviously, there will be politics all over the place. The right and the left will be criticizing many of us for having taken what I think is a very strong bipartisan step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a coalition of many Senators working to pull something together that has been difficult, that is never going to be easy to do. I look forward to the debate in the Senate next week as we try to craft a solution for America going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the President for his leadership on this issue, and Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Gutierrez, who have been here countless hours, and my other colleagues who have been in the room--Senator Menendez, who was finding it difficult to support the bill today but who has been there time and time again--and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, who has tried, also, and may not be completely satisfied, but they have been in the very dynamics of seeing good, dedicated servants,  such as these two Senators who are finding it difficult. We see the difficulty of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I would hope is that a good nucleus of us will pull together, will come together. My hope is Senators Cornyn and Salazar and Menendez, and many others, will find it possible to support this bill as we go into the debate next week. There will be opportunities to offer amendments. There may be ways of making it better. There could also be ways to make it a lot worse. My hope is we can hang together on this nucleus of a compromise that will make America stronger,  that will give some charity to people who are here, while at the same time giving America the assurance that our borders are going to be secured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not perfect. It is the best solution we could find today working together in good faith, in a bipartisan way. I hope the Senate will pass it. I hope it moves swiftly through the House, and we get it to the President's desk as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
