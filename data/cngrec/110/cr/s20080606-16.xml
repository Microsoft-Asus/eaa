    <paragraph>Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey, just described something that is very important. He described the role of himself and others, and particularly the occupant of the chair as Presiding Officer, in working on the new GI bill. I was proud to be a cosponsor. I join him in hoping that President Bush will agree with the majority of the House and the Senate to look favorably upon this bill and agree to sign legislation that includes this bill. We owe  it to America's veterans. I appreciate the comments made by my colleague from New Jersey.</paragraph>
