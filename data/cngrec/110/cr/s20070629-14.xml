    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to tell a story that is quite disturbing that happened in the Appropriations Committee yesterday. The Appropriations Committee, as reported to this Senator, had quite a row yesterday in the full committee in inserting a provision that will call for seismic exploration for oil and gas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It was such a row yesterday because it breaks the agreement that was made on the floor of the Senate last year in which the two Senators  from Florida, this Senator and my colleague Senator Martinez, had agreed to a plan by which there can be additional oil drilling and gas drilling in a lease sale 181 that would not be what was sought--about 2 million acres--but it expanded 8.3</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virtually all of the waters of the Gulf of Mexico off the State of Florida are this testing and training area. It is where we test our sophisticated weapons systems. It is where we test newly developed weapons systems. It is where we test weapons systems that have to go hundreds of miles, all of which these systems employ live ordinance under battlefield conditions in order to see that the equipment and the systems and the ordinance are all going to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over and over, we have had letters from the Secretary of Defense to the Senate saying we cannot have oil and gas rigs on the surface in the Gulf of Mexico in the area where we are doing all this testing and training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One wonders why, in the last round of the base realignment and closure, did the pilot training for the new FA-22 stealth fighter come to the Gulf of Mexico at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City. It is because that system now, in all pilot training,  does dogfights at 1.5 mach. That is 1 1/2  times the speed of sound. That is twice as much as the systems we have now, the F-16 and the F-15, twice as much that they do, the speed of air-to-air combat. As a result, they have to have so much wider area in which to have that turning radius as that weapons system is doing its practice in the dogfights shooting live ordinance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is it any wonder why, in the development of the new joint strike fighter, the F-35, that the F-35, once it is developed, all the pilot training for the Navy, for the Air Force, and for the Marines will take place on the gulf coast and it will take place at Eglin Air Force Base. Why? The same reason. We have that restricted airspace in the largest testing and training area in the world, and now we have a breaking of the agreement as a result of yesterday's Appropriations Committee action, a breaking  of the agreement that we had last year when this Senator and my colleague from Florida agreed we would have the expansion of lease sale 181 when it would not intrude into the military mission area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, want to propose  seismic exploration and inventorying of oil almost all the way up to the coast. Why do they want to do an inventory for oil unless they want to drill? This is exactly the situation that the oil industry will not give up. They want to drill, drill, drill, and that has been part of our problem for five decades as we have gone through  this drill, drill, drill mentality without going to alternative energy sources. That is what has led us to the point we are today--so dependent on oil--and even to the point of now importing 60 percent of our daily consumption of oil is coming from places such as the Persian Gulf, Nigeria, and Venezuela, all very unstable parts of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back to the breaking of the agreement. It was broken with regard to what we agreed to last year, that it was over and done with. We were going to protect the military mission area. That was broken yesterday in the Appropriations Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another thing that was broken in the Appropriations Committee was the fact that in our agreement, the two Senators from Florida had clearly tried to protect a $57 billion a year tourist industry that depends on pristine beaches. Our tourism economy depends on those beaches not having oil slicks slapping up onto those pristine white sands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Naturally, the Senators from Florida are going to protect that interest. People say: Oh, no, the spills that occur don't come from the oil rigs out there, they come from tankers. But isn't it interesting that we have so many photographs of oil rigs and oil slicks in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of Katrina raging across the Gulf of Mexico and ultimately hitting Mississippi and Louisiana? We have pictures of oil rigs that are up-ended on the shore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have pictures of pelicans, hundreds of pelicans that are dying, covered in oil slicks as a result of that storm causing the spills from those oil rigs. Now, we don't want that in Florida. We want to protect our beaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be one thing if the geology showed there was a lot of oil and gas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. But for the past 50 years, in the exploratory wells that have been there, there have been dry holes. The geology shows there is not that much oil and gas. Yet the oil industry never gives up, regardless of the agreements that have been made and were broken yesterday in the Senate Appropriations Committee. So it leaves no choice--no choice to the Senators from Florida. Senator Martinez  and this Senator will employ every available rule to us under the Senate Rules Committee to block the progress of that Energy appropriations bill as it comes to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were representations made yesterday to this Senator and to Senator Martinez that the leadership of the appropriations subcommittee will, in fact, strip out that part of the bill when it comes to the floor. I take those Senators at their word. If that is the case, we will not have a big fight on the floor of the Senate, and we can proceed and go about appropriating the monies that we need in an energy and water appropriations bill--much needed funding for so many projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a realistic heart that I have to make this speech today. So it comes to this. I will take the word of those Senators, and I will rely on their word that we won't have to engage in all kinds of parliamentary maneuvers. But if that be necessary, it will be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
