  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a resolution honoring Stax Records.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Soul music is a uniquely American art form that has enriched the Nation's cultural life. Indeed, its profound influences over popular music continues to be heard on today's music.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stax Records, founded in Memphis 50 years ago, played a crucial role in soul music's rise to prominence. As such, it is an icon of the American recording industry. In fact, its iconic status was recognized by NARAS last night during the Grammys, when Stax legends Booker T. and the M.G.'s and their Green Onions, and Stax co-founder Estelle Axton were honored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, the Staple Singers, Wilson Pickett, Luther Ingram, Albert King, the Bar-Kays, Johnnie Taylor, and Rufus and Carla Thomas are just a few of the many singers and musicians who started at Stax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the Memphis Convention and Visitors Bureau, Concord Music Group, Stax Records, and the Soulful Foundation will be celebrating both Memphis soul music, American soul music, and the 50th anniversary of Stax's founding. Therefore, I am introducing this resolution today to recognize Stax's and soul music's enormous contribution to America's cultural fabric, and ask my colleagues, including Congressman Miller, to recognize Memphis and soul music.</paragraph>
