  <speaking speaker="400645" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I bring some bad news from my home State of Oklahoma. We are facing a terrible ice storm in the eastern portion of our State, the Second Congressional District. We have had many homes without power. We have had trees fall over. We have had individuals lose their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would like the record to reflect that I am not going to be here tomorrow because I think it is more important that I be with my constituents. The Governor of the State of Oklahoma, Brad Henry, is also going to be touring the damage with me. And I would like the record to reflect that if I were here in this Chamber, I would have voted "aye" in regards to the cost savings for our college students here in the Congress.</paragraph>
