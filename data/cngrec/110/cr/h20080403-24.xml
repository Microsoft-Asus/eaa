    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, May 14 marks the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence. On behalf of the House Republican Israel Caucus, I rise today to honor the Jewish state for its significant achievements over the past six decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Israel has shared an important strategic relationship with our Nation. And today, our countries are working more closely than ever before to defeat the common threat of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research and development collaborations between our countries have produced security technologies that are now used to protect the lives of Americans, Israelis, and of people all over the world. In fact, Israeli equipment has saved the lives of hundreds of U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. And because of Israel's desert location, farmers and agricultural experts there have been forced to adapt their irrigation methods. This research now benefits dry weather areas around the world,  all because Israel discovered a way to make the desert bloom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, I have had the great fortune to travel to Israel four times, and each trip has been marked by emotional and spiritual moments. Anyone who has traveled to Israel feels a connection to the people and places there. This is because America shares a special bond with Israel. This bond will only become stronger in the next 60 years, and I am very humbled to begin this celebration.</paragraph>
