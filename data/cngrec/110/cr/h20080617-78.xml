  <speaking speaker="412226" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker for his patience this evening. I want to thank Congressman Forbes for putting the previous Special Order together on our religious history here in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it. There is a debate going on today in our culture over whose set of principles, whose set of values are going to prevail. There are those of us who understand the significance of faith, the importance of faith in public life, the importance of faith in America and our entire history and our entire experience, those of us who understand that faith has been central to making us the greatest Nation in human history versus those on the secular side who think we  need a more secular culture. That is the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is important that we weigh in on that debate. It is important that as we wage that debate and argue for the importance of faith in our culture and our public life that we recognize the religious history in the entire American experience that we have so enjoyed. I believe the American people get it. I believe the vast majority of families understand what the Founders understood, that faith is central to who we are as a people and to the great place we have as the greatest country in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been said many times already by previous speakers, but I think when you think about some of the things the Founders said, I love what Franklin said when they were in the midst of debate, and he was advocating for prayer before, so they could get through this impasse that they found themselves, he made the statement that if a sparrow can't fall without His knowledge, is it likely an empire can rise without His assistance? The Founders understood the importance of prayer. They understood  the importance of faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as many speakers have also referenced that document that I would argue next to Scripture, second only to Scripture, the greatest words ever put on paper, the Declaration of Independence, where the Founders wrote, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," fabulous language, this almost romantic vision that the Founders had about what this  country would offer to its people. They understood that we did, in fact, get our rights from the Almighty, and it is government's job not to grant us privileges, not to grant us rights, but to protect the rights we have by the very fact we were created in God's image.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that fundamental principle is different from any other country in history. And again, it sets us apart. And so it is important that we recognize this history and recognize this debate that is going on and not be afraid to stand up and defend those principles that make us special.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is appropriate that I end with one of my favorite Scriptures in II Timothy where Paul writes to Timothy. He says, "I fought the good fight, I finished the course, I have kept the faith." And that is our charge as Americans, to fight the fight, to finish the course and to keep the faith that the Founders understood was central to making us the greatest nation ever.</paragraph>
