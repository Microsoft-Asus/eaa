  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="NOT VOTING--8">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was scheduled to speak at 6:30. We had a vote at 6:30. It is my understanding that I now have the floor to speak on the bill on which we just voted.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="NOT VOTING--8">
    <paragraph>I rise to discuss the war in Iraq and specifically the legislation at hand which directs the President to transition the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has voted on this same issue on four separate occasions in this session alone. Not one of those times did the measure receive even one-third of the Senate's support. Nonetheless, here we are again debating the policies of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. There is certainly nothing wrong with openly debating those policies. It is our responsibility as Members of this body to discuss thoroughly what is arguably the most important and defining issue of our day. In fact, I find it highly curious there was an attempt to castigate those who voted for this debate and who wanted the full 30 hours to talk about this vital issue. Some in this body seem to have perhaps been a little too clever and tried to summon as much outrage against  debating this matter as they were prepared to use in support of debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do question exactly what those in support of this bill hoped to realistically accomplish with this debate and this legislation before us given the gains that have been made through the surge strategy. Last May when the surge was being implemented, only 29 Senators voted for similar legislation. Undoubtedly, much has changed for the better since that point. Violence in Iraq is down 60 percent since the start of the surge and 80 percent in and around Iraq. There has been a 30-percent increase  since June in insurgent weapon caches discovered. Economic improvements continue. Oil production is constantly increasing, up 50 percent from this time last year. And oil revenues are nearly double what they were last year. In Baghdad alone, 21 new health clinics opened this year, 1,885 new schools have been built, and another 1,604 have been refurbished throughout Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of reconstruction and rebuilding, electricity demand is up 25 percent. A year ago, it would have been laughable to suggest that Anbar Province be transferred to Iraqi control. But that will happen in May. When this occurs, Anbar will be 10 out of 18 provinces under full Iraqi control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Ramadi in Anbar was once one of the most dangerous cities in Iraq. It is now one of its safest following the surge. The number of U.S. combat battalions operating in Ramadi has decreased from five to two in less than a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An Army combat brigade that has been stationed in Ramadi for over a year is scheduled to leave the area in March and is not scheduled to be replaced. The United States is on pace to transfer control of all Iraqi provinces by the end of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The surge strategy is brilliant in its simplicity: Exert our military forces to quell insurgent violence in order to create an environment suitable for fostering and sustaining a legitimate government capable of governing its citizens. Real political progress will only be reached when Iraqis feel secure, and the results of the surge are proving this to be exactly the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus far the surge is producing its intended results by eliminating terrorists, interrupting communications between insurgents in many areas in Iraq, and ensuring safety for the people which, in turn, allows far broader, far greater cooperation and association with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only with these security improvements do Iraqis have a reasonable chance of finding a political solution. This strategy is convincing many Iraqis to abandon terrorist methods and turn against groups such as al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our efforts are reuniting torn communities and enabling political process. Obviously, this Nation would have been better served had the surge strategy been implemented earlier. But the ability to criticize strategy is not the same as the ability to strategize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I applaud those who did finally implement the surge strategy and congratulate them on their vision. As we know, Iraq must stand up before we can stand down. Again, David Petraeus has stated there cannot be solely a military solution to violence without political action. And he is absolutely correct in his assertion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent weeks, Iraqis have made tremendous political strides under what are still difficult and onerous conditions and as a result increased security in their nation. February 13 saw the Council of Representatives pass three key pieces of legislation: amnesty for Sunni security detainees, a provincial powers law, and a budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Debaathification reform was enacted last month as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's talk about those political accomplishments. The general amnesty law passed by the Shiite-majority Parliament sets the guidelines in providing amnesty for thousands of detainees held in Iraq detention facilities. This helps to remove one of the greatest stumbling blocks to reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iraqi Parliament has also passed the provincial powers law which outlines the balance of authorities between the central and local governments while also specifying that provincial elections be held on October 1 of this year. The Iraqi Parliament approved a $48 billion budget, representing a step toward Iraq using its own resources to provide for security and infrastructure reconstruction. This Sunni-Shia compromise budget allows the Kurds a larger share of the budget, which is 17 percent.  Iraqi oil revenues have soared with the rise of global prices, and Iraqi production has increased due to gains in security. The money is now going to the provinces on a regular basis where it will fund urgently needed reconstruction and humanitarian relief. The Iraqi Government is now providing the kind of services that give the Iraqi people a stake in their own success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the President's council approved the law of accountability and justice on February 3, 2008. This law could allow thousands of former Ba'ath party officials to return to Government jobs and receive pensions, helping the reconciliation process and stimulating the economy. In addition, even more groundbreaking legislation is slated for consideration in the very near future. These initiatives include a hydrocarbons law to determine the level of control allocated to the central Government  as well as an election law that is being drafted currently by the Prime Minister's office. While the job is far  from over and much work is still required, these recent accomplishments on the political and economic fronts continue to gather momentum and show important signs of progress and create reasons</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even the media, which has often been one-sided on the war, has for several months now been forced to report that the surge and coalition efforts have been succeeding. Let's look at some of the headlines:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Post, February 23, 2007, "Sadr Extends Truce in Iraq"; the Los Angeles Times, February 22, 2008, "U.S. Micro-Loan Effort Yields Big Results in Iraqi Province"; the Colorado Springs Gazette, February 18, 2008, "Baghdad Neighborhood is a Model of Progress"; Reuters, February 16 of this year, "Attacks in Baghdad Fall 80 Percent"; Reuters, a February 13 article, "Iraq Lawmakers Pass Key Budget and Amnesty Laws"; Reuters on January 17 of 2008, "Iraqi Forces Could Control  All Provinces This Year"; even the New York Times, February 14, 2008, "Making (Some) Progress in Iraq"; the Washington Post on February 10, 2008, "Diary of an Insurgent in Retreat: Al-Qaeda in Iraq Figure Lists Woes"; the AP, February 2, 2008, "Lynch: US Surge Tipped Scales</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coalition success is being seen all over Iraq. It is being reported. The only people who seem to refuse to see it or admit we are winning in Iraq are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who continue time and again to bring this issue to the floor claiming that the surge has not worked and urging immediate troop withdrawal. Certain Members of Congress continue to deny that any progress has been made. Earlier this month the Speaker of the House described the surge as a failure. Opponents  long criticized the administration for not sending more troops to Iraq. But when this strategy was installed, it was also attacked as opponents declared that this effort was essentially too little, too late. When the surge began to show great military success, it faded from the floor of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why we welcome the chance to spend 30 hours on this topic. It is a shame that now, when both military and political success is being realized, we are only debating whether to retreat. If that is the ground the majority wishes to stand on, so be it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a moment let's consider the severity of the issue at hand. We are debating whether to deploy our forces which would essentially concede the country to whatever group eventually gains control that would likely plunge the country into further unrest and chaos. It seems we are acting under the assumption that if we get all of our forces out, we can slam the door behind us and all will be fine. This policy fails to lend any consideration to what would certainly be dire consequences that would  ensue as a result of our Nation abandoning Iraq at this critical juncture. To do this would simply be irresponsible and shortsighted. Iraq is the pivotal front in our global war on terror. To intentionally abandon our progress and lose the battle would surely cause irrevocable harm to our efforts to secure our</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Intelligence Council stated:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge that al Qaeda in Iraq would attempt to use parts of the country--particularly al-Anbar province--to plan increased attacks in and outside Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this legislation, we would be running away from a war from the floor of the Senate. When has it ever been sound policy for legislators to micromanage a war from Washington? I don't ever recall in our history this tactic being successful in achieving our strategic goals. In fact, let me remind our colleagues, we have seen terrible results from political motives being placed above military necessity. Installing an artificial deadline is not what we need. It is not what is good for the  Nation. It is not good for the future of Iraq and the long-term stability of that region. We have heard from our military intelligence professionals who have warned about the possible consequences of hasty withdrawal and the potentially catastrophic results that may ensue. We should also listen to our folks</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my lifetime I have witnessed few events that compare to the joy and jubilation that accompany the homecoming of a  military unit. When I have seen a brigade return home to Fort Carson or a wing to Peterson Air Force base, there are no words to describe the sheer emotion of seeing families returned to loved ones and friends. However, redeploying our forces at this point is not the proper course of action and not in the best interests of our Nation. Our military does not exist just to come marching home, and our military understands this. They exist to fight our enemies and secure our vital national interests.  Removing Saddam Hussein from power was in our national interest. Stability in the Middle East is in our national interest. Securing Iraq from terrorist control is in our national interest. Pandering speeches about bringing the troops home that strive for mere political points and fail to acknowledge strategic realities are not in our national interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We still have a job that needs to be completed. We still have work to do. When the time is right, we will redeploy responsibly. The Iraqi Government is making progress. We are beginning to be able to stand down to a greater extent than we have in the past. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will return to Washington and report on the progress in Iraq in April. We owe to it our men and women in harm's way to listen to the experts and make our decisions off of their findings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Wisconsin.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="NOT VOTING--8">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has voted overwhelmingly to allow some debate of the Feingold-Reid al-Qaida bill, but it is pretty clear to everyone that this body still doesn't fully understand and is not ready to address head on the threat posed by al-Qaida. As was made clear during debate on the Iraq redeployment legislation, too many Members confuse the war in Iraq with the fight against al-Qaida. That is true of the administration too. While it is focused on Iraq, al-Qaida  has reconstituted itself along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Don't take my word for it. Listen to our intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early this month, the Director of National Intelligence testified before Congress that the central leadership based in the border area of Pakistan is al-Qaida's most dangerous component. A few months ago, the DNI again repeated the intelligence community's assessment that over the last few years "Al Qaeda's central leadership has been able to regenerate the core operational capabilities needed to conduct attacks in the Homeland"--our homeland, Mr. President, the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DNI also testified that al-Qaida "is improving the last key aspect of its ability to attack the U.S.: the identification, training, and positioning of operatives for an attack in the Homeland."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan is serving as a staging ground for al-Qaida in support of the Taliban and providing it with a base similar to the one it used to have across the border in Afghanistan. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, testified  recently that "the most likely near term attack on the United States will come from Al Qaeda via" its safe havens in Pakistan--not in Iraq, in Pakistan.  Over the past year, we have seen an unprecedented rise in suicide bombings in Pakistan. The Taliban is gaining ground in Afghanistan. While we may be sending an additional 3,200 marines to Afghanistan in the near future, we have been fighting for far too long there with too few soldiers and too few reconstruction funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying in "Iraq we do what we must and in Afghanistan we do what we can," it is no wonder that Afghanistan is teetering on the edge. Let me remind my colleagues that it was from Afghanistan--Afghanistan, not Iraq--that the 9/11 attacks were planned. And it was under the Taliban regime, which is once again gaining ground, that al-Qaida was able to flourish so freely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida affiliates from Africa to Southeast Asia pose a significant terrorist threat. While we have been so myopically fixated on Iraq, the threat from an al-Qaida affiliate in north Africa has grown and now, according to the DNI's testimony, "represents a significant threat to the United States and European interests in the region." Since its merger with al-Qaida in September 2006, it has expanded its targets to include the United States, the United Nations, and other interests. And it likely  got a further boost when al-Qaida leadership announced last November that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group united with al-Qaida under AQIM's leadership. Its possible reach covers Tunisia, Morocco, Nigeria, Mauritania, Libya, and other countries. Meanwhile, it is using deadly tactics that suggest</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida has affiliates around the world--in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Lebanon, where al-Qaida poses a growing threat, the Horn of Africa, and Southeast Asia. We cannot ignore the rest of the world to focus solely on Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida is and will continue to be a global terrorist organization with dangerous affiliates around the world. We are watching al-Qaida strengthen and develop its affiliates around the world while we remain bogged down in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a robust military presence and an effective reconstruction program in Afghanistan. We need to build strong partnerships where al-Qaida and its affiliates are operating--across north Africa, in Southeast Asia, and along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and we need to address the root causes of the terrorist threat, not just rely on military power to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can start doing that by passing <bill type="s" number="2634">S. 2634</bill>. This bill requires the administration to provide Congress with a report outlining a comprehensive global strategy to defeat al-Qaida and its affiliates. The strategy must ensure U.S. resources and assets are targeted appropriately to meet the regional and country-specific threats we face, and that troop deployments do not overstretch our military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who could oppose a commonsense bill such as this? Well, as I noted earlier, the administration actually issued a veto threat for this bill. That threat makes the baffling argument that preparing a report on the threat of al-Qaida may somehow "inhibit the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief." That is not all. The administration also argues that preparing a plan that prioritizes operations against al-Qaida would tie the hands of commanders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just plain double-talk. We are trying to help our commanders and the rest of our Government to properly dedicate their resources to our most pressing national security concern. This bill does not tell our commanders how to carry out any operations; it merely requires a report. The Congress has a constitutional responsibility, in collaboration with the President, to determine what are our national security priorities. That is what we should be doing. That is what this bill would do. Unless  the President has completely abandoned the idea of civilian control of the military, and of the shared responsibilities between the legislative and executive branches, then he should have no objection to my bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration does say that it "supports the bill's goals and intent, with regard to updating and informing Congress and the American people on the strategy to combat terrorism." I guess that is good news. But then it cites two documents it has already prepared on this topic. One is the September 2006 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, which sets broad goals but does not include the detail called for in our bill about how limited resources will be allocated to achieve this strategic  vision. That 2006 document also does not prioritize the geographic--country and region-specific--threats we face from AQ and its affiliates, which is essential because how else--how else, Mr. President--will we know where to focus our resources?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other document cited by the administration is the National Implementation Plan. I am a member of both the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, and I am not even allowed to see that document. The administration will not even share it with the full Intelligence Committee. So the idea this document is an acceptable substitute for what is called for in the Feingold-Reid bill is absurd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration suggests our bill limits the President's authority to withhold information. Now, I agree we need to protect classified information, and there is nothing in my bill--nothing--that would prevent the addition of a classified annex. Much of our strategic planning, however, is not classified, consistent with our country's belief in open government and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people deserve to be told, to the extent possible without divulging classified information, what their government is doing to protect them. The President's veto threat is further evidence of his unwillingness to be straight with the American people about the fact that the war in Iraq is actually undermining our national security. The President's current strategy is to prioritize operations in Iraq, even to the detriment of operations in Afghanistan against those who attacked us on  9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that does not make sense. It has to change, and we have to change it today by passing this Feingold-Reid bill, refocusing our attention and resources on al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from North Carolina.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="HEALTH CARE REFORM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the most pressing issues in America today is: What will Congress do to address health care? The American people deserve a 21st century health care system--not just a delivery system of doctors and hospitals but a system that is integrated, one that recognizes society has changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body, several years ago, extended a new benefit to Medicare, where we covered prescription drugs in a health care delivery system that was created in the 1960s, when drugs were not a common treatment for disease. It took us until the 21st century to recognize that if we would enhance the benefit so we could match the disease with some of the breakthroughs, that the outcome was different, that Americans actually got better, that the cost actually went down because we eliminated the number  of incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's health is at risk. When I say America's health is at risk, I am talking about the physical health and the economic health of this country. It is impossible to believe that unless you transform health care so it works for everybody in this country that American business can be competitive in a global marketplace that is not coming, that we are part of today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Republicans want to propose to this body and to America one main goal. That goal is that we are committed--Republicans are committed--to providing every American with genuine access to quality, affordable health care that protects the sacred doctor-patient relationship. This is what everybody thinks of when they think of a health care  plan: health care coverage that recognizes them as an individual and coverage they need to provide security for their family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me restate it. We are committed to providing every American with genuine access to quality, affordable health care that protects the sacred  doctor-patient relationship. Nothing else should get between that. It should not be determined based upon an arbitrary third-party reimburser or the Federal Government. The reality is, when we provide every American with this opportunity, we have a system that functions like the marketplace is designed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do we get there? No. 1: access and choice. All Americans have a right to choose their doctor, to choose their hospital, and, I believe, to choose the health care plan they want, and, more importantly, they deserve. No Washington, DC, bureaucrat should deny that right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans like choice. We know that. Americans do not like to have one choice. They like multiple choices. As a matter of fact, when you have one, you really do not have a choice. Some politicians want to give America one choice. It is the debate potentially of this next election cycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me teach America a new word. It is called "universal control." Universal control: when one entity is in charge of the only choice, and now they control how they provide that; they control what it looks like; they control where you get it; they control what the cost is. All of a sudden, this innovative, creative health care system we have had in America--that has not worked for everybody because our target has not been to make sure every American is covered--all of a sudden it totally breaks  down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, one health care package, one set of doctors, one set of treatments, one set of prescriptions is not what America is looking for. America is looking for choice. North Carolinians do not want one choice, and they certainly do not want bureaucrats in Washington, DC, defining what their choices are going to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A majority of Americans are willing to pay a little bit more to have more choices. I strongly believe doctors and patients--not lawyers and bureaucrats--should have the power to make health care decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The challenge is that Americans believe that is the most important thing. Clearly, access to health care is directly dependent upon cost. Americans must have access and choice, but they also have to have affordable coverage. Republicans believe the best health care in the world is worthless if Americans cannot afford it, and I think we would all agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would drive down costs by giving Americans control over their own health care choices, making sure patients have the information they need to make good decisions, guaranteeing vigorous competition that benefits patients, and holding the entire health care system accountable to the patients' needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, in many cases we have used Government as the accountability measure. We miss the boat. The accountability measure is making sure patients hold the system, patients hold the doctors, patients hold the hospitals accountable; more importantly, patients hold the insurers accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This belief that a patient cannot negotiate with an insurer--well, quite frankly, these days are over. We need to drive down costs. We need to give Americans control over their own health care choices. We need to make sure patients have the information they need to make good choices--the right choices for them, for their family, for their age, for their illness or their health conditions, and, more importantly, for their income, guaranteeing vigorous competition that benefits patients. The focus  here is on patients, holding the entire health care system accountable to patients' needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest if health care could be more like a television--with a television, you have real competition. You have a choice of over the air, you have a choice of basic, you have a choice of cable, you have a choice of cable with premiums, and you have a choice of DirectTV. In fact, with television, you know exactly what comes with each option. You know exactly how much it costs, and you know you get what you pay for. That can be the only reason that on-demand sports has become so popular.  It is because when you want to watch a sporting event, and you see exactly what the cost is, you can make a calculation as an individual as to whether that is worth it to you. Americans should have all the competition, the choice, the control, and the information they need when it comes to health care decisions. So affordable coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you a story. My oldest son is now 23. Shortly before he became 22, I was notified by the Office of Personnel Management in Washington that in the Federal Government, regardless of where you were in the Federal Government, your children, when they turned the age of 22, even if they were in school--which mine were--had to be dropped from your health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, forget the fact--I can see the Presiding Officer is struggling with this. That does not save any money. You are exactly right. You are taking the healthiest of America, and you are taking them out of the risk pool that helps hold down the risk for us older guys who are more susceptible to disease. But somewhere the Federal Government got this idea that they are going to save money by dropping people when they become 22 years old--the healthiest of the American population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I went through the realization that this is actually going to happen. There is no way you can change it. So I called OPM to say: Surely, you have negotiated coverage for our children. I would like something that resembles the plan I had with Blue Cross Blue Shield. They quoted me the exact same plan: $5,400 a year. Twenty-two years old, healthy as a bull, still in college, and all of a sudden, as a parent, I was strapped with the decision that for him to have coverage it was going to cost</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did not stop there. I picked up the phone. I called the university he was at and found out a local insurer, insurance agent, had negotiated with Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage for kids who fell into this situation where they did not have insurance. I described to him the plan. He quoted me the exact same plan that as a Member of the Senate I had, which, before, my son was covered under, with the same deductible, the same copay, the same limits--the exact same plan. But this was negotiated  by an independent insurance agent in Chapel Hill, NC, against the same Blue Cross Blue Shield that the Federal Government, representing 1.3 million employees, negotiated with; and on behalf of my son, he negotiated a cost of $1,500 per year--$1,500 versus $5,400, a fairly significant savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We sit here and wonder: What can the American people do with the right information relative to the decisions they have to make as it relates to health care coverage? If it is that difficult to figure out how to have the coverage you need at the cost you can afford, envision how difficult it is for a patient without information to decide what type of chemotherapy they are going to take, when all of a sudden the doctor walks in and says: You have cancer and you are going to die without treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a difficult thing without the ability to go out and search for the information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third item is quality care and prevention. Here is a unique word in health care, "prevention." It is something that probably for decades we should have incorporated into the coverage each of us has. We believe in strengthening health care by providing consistent, dependable quality and promoting the principles of prevention. What is prevention? Let's change our habits. Let's educate ourselves. Let's do the things that keep us healthy. And let's actually pay annually to let somebody go in  and see the doctor and make sure there is not a health condition they have that could be prevented, early, without the incidence of an inpatient stay in the hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will harness the powerful promise of advanced research and modern technology to create innovative new treatments and breakthrough cures, promote wellness, and empower consumers with accurate, comprehensive information on quality health care that is available for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Choice, information: I believe strengthening health care by providing consistent, dependable quality and promoting prevention is absolutely essential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating innovative new treatments and breakthrough cures: Let me ask my colleagues, if innovation didn't take place, what would the diabetics do  today, those who currently have a diabetic pump that is implanted in their side, that automatically reads their blood sugar 24 hours a day, administers the insulin when they need it. No longer do they go through a finger prick. No longer do they get an inconsistent reading. No longer do they inject themselves  later than they need to keep a balance. Why is that important? Because for somebody with diabetes who can constantly maintain their blood sugar at the right level, it means none of the horrors we heard about and saw and that many families lived with before when the management was not as precise. The result was, eventually they began to go blind, eventually began to have a toe, two toes, all their toes, a foot, a leg amputated because of the effects of diabetes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a student who had diabetes, the likelihood was that they would never play organized sports because the demands on an athlete mean they have a blood sugar spike that is incredible, and without the ability to regulate that, it was impossible. Now kids are playing soccer at every age and running around with a pump that is automatically reading their blood sugar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How about for some of us who are a little bit older and we probably are susceptible--because we haven't done everything we should do regarding healthy habits, we are susceptible to high cholesterol. Where would we be without the pharmaceuticals' breakthrough of cholesterol drugs? I will tell my colleagues where we would be. We would be funding $8,000-plus bypass surgeries at an alarming rate that would bankrupt the system, both public and private. But today we have this little pill we can take.  It doesn't take the place of exercise, it doesn't take the place of diet, but it certainly enhances our chances that we are not going to be selected to have bypass surgery, open-heart surgery; that we are not going to have the recovery time, the loss of productivity at work because innovation allowed us now to inject in that quality arena a different outcome based upon innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to promote wellness. We want to empower consumers with accurate, comprehensive information. The United States has the best health care system in the world. I will tell my colleagues, North Carolina is a big reason as to why health care is so good. We need to make sure quality stays high while improving the access. Congress needs to foster--not hinder--research and development of treatments and cures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just mentioned prevention and wellness. Those words need to be the first thing Americans think about when they think "health care" or when they think "doctors." Prevention and wellness. Doctors should be paid to help people stay healthy instead of just paying them to treat individuals who are sick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My final thought for this section: Patients should have as much information prior to using doctors and hospitals as they do prior to buying cars. What a novel idea. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is starting to provide quality, Web-based information about nursing homes and hospitals. The initiative needs to keep growing so all patients have the ability to research all aspects of health care. That happens in real time at the tips of our fingers. Access and choice, affordable coverage,  quality care and prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fourth piece--and we shouldn't be shocked because this is America--personal ownership and security. But this is something our system has never incorporated. We believe Americans should own and control their health care coverage and should have the freedom and the flexibility to take it with them when they change jobs, just like a 401(k).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hard-working Americans deserve the peace of mind to know the care they need will be the care they receive and that their financial security will be protected from catastrophic events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans will achieve this security and will receive better care if the health care system is highly personalized and guarantees patient control. What does that mean? With the right information, with the right resources, any American should have the ability to construct a health care plan that meets their age, their health, their income, and have the financial security of knowing they are covered. Some might call this ala carte, the ability to construct something that meets--for those of us  who are over a certain age, we have probably already been instructed by our spouses that we have had all the children we are going to have. That is a little tough in this body because we have had some Members who had them at quite a late stage in life. But I fall into that category. I can't buy health insurance coverage that doesn't come with maternity coverage. I pay for it knowing I am never going to use it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, maybe I am helping to subsidize somebody else. But while we are here talking about every American being insured, the reason we are here is because that subsidy is going on today. It goes on in every company. In goes on  with everybody who pays out of pocket. It is something that happens to each of us who have health insurance, and it is triggered by somebody who receives a service in health care and either won't or can't pay. So to recover the cost of the delivery of that benefit, hospitals, doctors, every delivery point in health care does what they call cost-shift. They charge that cost of delivering that service over to the people who have coverage or who can pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When all of a sudden you have a goal and a commitment that every American is insured, the cost-shift goes away. What is the score on that? It is $200 billion a year. So that is $200 billion that today does not go to the delivery of one ounce of care. It is shifted to people who can pay or who are covered. All of a sudden now we know the answer to why health care increases at double-digit rates of inflation on an annual basis. It is because as the pool of uninsured continues to grow, the amount  of cost-shift continues to grow, and the cost-shift is directly dumped on those companies that provide coverage for their employees, for us as individuals if we go to the marketplace and we buy coverage or to us who pay out of pocket when we access health care because it is shifted evenly across the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forget the fact that if we adopt this, if we achieve it, that, one, we have a more manageable system--a system, quite honestly, that incorporates access and choice, affordability, quality and prevention and wellness, personal ownership, and the security of knowing you have coverage. We drive the costs down for every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal is to continue to have the best health care system in the world, to continue to drive innovation and medical breakthroughs, and to do it in a way that brings the overall cost of health care down. If we can begin to see the trend line on inflation and health care begin to go south, it is amazing what type of an incentive it will be to individuals who now engage in the prevention and wellness section and begin to look at ways that they can control the cost of their health care because  it is now theirs, they own it, they have constructed it, they can change it as they need to, and--oh, yes, by the way, to accomplish this, we have to have 50 States that have high-risk pools that take those individuals with preexisting conditions, and we collectively buy their cost of insurance</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a way to maintain the highest level of care in the world, the highest commitment to innovation and breakthroughs, to look down the road and know we are going to cure things tomorrow, that today there is only one outcome and it is to live. If we don't change and transform our health care system and begin to promote prevention and wellness and to drive the costs down, the first thing that will leave is innovation, the innovation that treats  many  of us today in a totally different way, with a multitude of options we never had. If, in fact, we don't begin to change this, the system will reflect one choice, one doctor, one hospital, one delivery port.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I challenge my colleagues today that is universal control, control where one entity--the Federal Government--dictates where we go, who we see, what they are reimbursed for delivering the service, and the outcome will be the lack of innovation, the lack of breakthroughs, and no reason for the American people to make healthy choices and to engage in prevention and wellness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is where we are. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will engage and encourage our leadership to have a healthy debate on health care. I haven't locked in to any prescribed legislation tonight. It is the principles of the Republican Conference that I am here to present and will continue to come back to the Senate floor to present. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: let's come to the floor. Bring your legislation. Let's examine it, let's debate it, let's let  America see it. Let them be the judge. At the end of the day, it is the American people who will influence where this debate goes, and that is exactly who should influence it. They are the patients of the future health care system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
