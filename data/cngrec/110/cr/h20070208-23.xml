    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, taxpayer funded luxury travel is not accorded to our brave men and women serving the cause of liberty. However, the new Democrat leadership believes they deserve just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the previous Speaker of the House was afforded the use of a military aircraft as a security precaution following 9/11, it didn't include the amenities being sought by the current Democrat Speaker, room for 42 passengers, a crew of 16, state-of-the-art entertainment and communications and a private bedroom. Nonetheless, that which was good enough for prior leadership is apparently just not good enough for the new leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few months ago, Speaker Pelosi told the American people that Democrats were committed to a new direction in the way our government does business. At a cost of $15,000 an hour it should go without saying that this is certainly a new direction, one which frankly disgusts all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, spending watchdogs should be part of the new Democrat majority's budget, and they should be watching themselves. This has been a disgrace.</paragraph>
