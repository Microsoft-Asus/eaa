  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday's Supreme Court decision to uphold a ban on partial birth abortion has been a long time coming. Opinion polls have long shown overwhelming opposition to this gruesome and horrific procedure, and in response, Congress acted to ban partial birth abortion, passing the ban two times during the Clinton administration only to have it vetoed by President Clinton both times. In 2003, Congress passed the ban again with bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate, and  this time it was signed into law by President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unable to win through the democratic process, proponents of abortion-on-demand took to the courts, and for years their efforts delayed a final decision, leaving unborn children without protection from this gruesome procedure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, yesterday's decision ends the uncertainty, and this ruling protects America's unborn children from a barbaric, grisly procedure that has no place in a civilized society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a win for the sanctity of human life and a win for American democracy.</paragraph>
