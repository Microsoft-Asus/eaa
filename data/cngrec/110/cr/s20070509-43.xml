    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation today. I especially thank the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee for his help and assistance and for his continuing graciousness as we consider the budget resolution, as well as all the Members who participated in the debate. I thought it was a very helpful debate--animated at times but genuine, sincere, and in the best traditions of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to take this moment to thank the staffs, especially staff on my side, for unbelievable hours and devotion to getting a final product passed, and one we can be proud of. This staff has worked night and day, weekends, over and over, and I want to thank them publicly and commend them for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should also acknowledge the staff on the other side, who have also worked long hours and have conducted themselves in the best tradition of the Senate.</paragraph>
