  <narrative>COUNTY PAYMENTS: WASCO COUNTY, OREGON -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4158]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WALDEN of Oregon asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400419" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by refusing to renew the Federal county payments program, Congress has broken its promise to rural, timbered America. Counties like Wasco County in Oregon are affected. It has laid off nine people from its road department, seven full-time, two part-time. That's one-third of its entire road department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The county has more than 700 miles of road, and not a single road construction project is now underway. County Commissioner Sherry Holliday said, "Counties can't do any strategic planning when our budget is totally up in the air." Well, there is a solution, <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, a bipartisan 4-year reauthorization of county timber payments. It's been on the Union Calendar and ready for a vote since January 15. The administration has put forward a variety of offsets to pay for it, and yet the Democratic  leadership of this House has refused to bring it up for a vote. That's 126 days that <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill> has been held hostage by the leadership of this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to restore the Federal Government's century-old commitment to rural, timbered communities where Federal lands make up so much of their county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call on the leadership once again, free <bill type="h" number="3058">H.R. 3058</bill>, bring it up for a vote, keep the roads and schools open in rural America.</paragraph>
