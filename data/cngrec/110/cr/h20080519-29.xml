    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to present for consideration <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill>, the Federal Electronic Equipment Donation Act, which will preserve an existing executive order issued during the Clinton administration directing Federal agencies to donate excess computer equipment to schools and education nonprofits, particularly those located in high-need areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, I would like to have my colleague, the Honorable G.K. BUTTERFIELD, to have as much time as he will consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding the time and thank her for her leadership on this committee, and certainly thank her for her work on this bill. I also would like to thank Chairman Towns, in his absence, for allowing this matter to come to the committee and for his hard work not only on the committee, but here in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in short, <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill> codifies Executive Order 12999, making many of the provisions permanent law, but also adds provisions making this much-needed equipment far more accessible to poor and underserved regions of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FEED Act, as we refer to it, would streamline the process for donating excess and surplus electronic equipment to small cities and towns and counties and school districts and libraries and community-based educational nonprofit organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation gives preference to poorer communities, which often have the greatest needs. This act would direct Federal agencies to transfer excess equipment to the GSA for transfer to the qualifying recipient at little or no cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current system, Mr. Speaker, of acquiring Federal surplus equipment is flawed. It is riddled with governmental redtape. Many times it can take months or even years to receive requested equipment. There was one such case in my district, which was actually the impetus for the introduction of this bill, where GSA only began working on fulfilling the request after direct congressional action. Citizens in need of technology should be able to get it without bureaucratic redtape, which only serves  to discourage the applicant from pursuing their goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as you know, you and I both represent poor districts. I represent the 15th poorest district in the Nation. If my recollection is correct, you represent the poorest district in the Nation. And so we certainly understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents do not have access to the technology afforded to so many. A small county, like Washington County in my district, which is the fifth poorest county in my State, are home to towns like Roper, North Carolina. With the county unemployment rate reaching nearly 8 percent, the visionary leadership of Mayor Estelle "Bunny" Sanders has transformed Roper into a technology oasis with job creation and training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Roper, North Carolina, houses a technology center where citizens are put to work refurbishing and updating and repairing electronic equipment acquired through the process. They also receive training in Web development, server management and computer maintenance. Without the necessary excess and surplus electronic equipment with which to work, the technology center and its trainees stand the risk of losing years of hard work. Mayor Sanders has the patience and determination required to navigate  the murky waters of Federal excess and surplus equipment, but most would not be that resilient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends an enormous amount of the taxpayers' money on technology. Last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's budget included about $110 million in annual technology-related costs. Once equipment becomes slightly outdated, it shouldn't just sit idle while there are so many needy small communities and schools and libraries that can still put it to good use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the United States, many of our small towns and rural areas lack the very basic technology that many of us take for granted. This important legislation grants underprivileged communities across America access to Federal excess and surplus computers, printers and audio/visual and other technological equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, Mr. Speaker, is particularly important to communities in my district, and will be an important tool in building the electronic infrastructure for local governments, schools, libraries and nonprofits. Many of the communities that I represent need every bit of help they can get from this government, and hopefully this will free up some resources that can be used to address other pressing needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have offered this legislation that will directly impact the lives of the underserved in this country. I would particularly like to thank Mayor Sanders for her work and dedication, and Mr. John Rosenthall, who has worked so hard with my staff for nearly 2 years in seeing this bill to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the current system is hurting the very people that it was set up to help. This is a good bill. It is a good piece of legislation that will help not only the people in Roper or in my district, but help people all across the country, and we will all benefit from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "aye" on <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation that codifies the 1996 executive order of President Clinton that was issued to promote the proper use of excess Federal computers and electronic equipment to schools of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might want to clarify, because I know a lot of people hear us on the House floor and they only know what they've heard. If you hear "excess" and "surplus," you might think that, in fact, what we're doing is simply overbuying and letting it sit in warehouses and then giving it away. Virtually all of this equipment in the executive branch, as in the legislative branch, are equipment that we have used for 2, 3, 4 years. It is, in fact, past its prime for us, but very usable by many other institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to support this bill. I would like to also make sure people understand that we're not just simply overbuying. And the term "excess" or "surplus" doesn't by any means indicate that we're not using America's dollars wisely, but rather, we're using America's dollars again by making them available to people who can use a slightly used computer, who don't need the latest version of Windows and might not need the latest version of Pentium software. But, in fact, this  can help schools around America in poor neighborhoods and  even not so poor neighborhoods have a better opportunity and use their hard-earned and hard-given dollars in other areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So I support this resolution. I hope that the American public understands that this is a great way of causing these products not to go into landfills 3, 4, 5 years earlier than they otherwise would by making them available to those who can use them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in my desire to get through my prepared remarks a moment ago, I failed to recognize and thank the minority side for its work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly appreciate you, Mr. Issa, and all that you have done on the committee and particularly your staff. You've been very helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I want to go on record in support of your comments that is not new equipment that's just sitting in a warehouse unused. It's equipment that has outused its lifetime here on Capitol Hill and in other places but certainly can be used by smaller communities. So I want to associate myself with your remarks.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsor, Mr. Butterfield, for his work on the bill, as well as the various Members that helped to move this bill forward. We also got helpful input from the Committee on Science and Technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Waxman and Chairman Gordon exchanged letters regarding committee jurisdiction, and I will include these letters in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Technology,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 9, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to you concerning the jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Science and Technology in <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill>, the Federal Electronic Equipment Donation Act of 2007. The Committee on Science and Technology has jurisdictional interest in this bill based on the Committee's history of jurisdiction over the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Transfer Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-480). The Committee on Science and Technology was the sole House Committee of jurisdiction over the Stevenson-Wydler  Technology Transfer Act of 1980 and has maintained jurisdiction over the law ever since. <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill> makes specific mention of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Transfer Act of 1980 and creates a program with overlapping objectives to those found in that act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Science and Technology acknowledges the importance of <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill> and the need for the legislation to move expeditiously. Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over this bill, I agree not to request a sequential referral. This, of course, is conditional on our mutual understanding that nothing in this legislation or my decision to forgo a sequential referral waives, reduces, or otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology, and that  a copy of this letter and of your response will be included in the Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the House Floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Science and Technology also expects that you will support our request to be conferees during any House-Senate conference on this, or any similar legislation. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bart Gordon,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress of the United States, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 9, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your letter regarding <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill>, the Federal Electronic Equipment Donation Act of 2008, which the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform reported, as amended, on April 9, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation and I recognize that the bill, as reported, contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology. I agree that your inaction with respect to this bill does not prejudice the Science and Technology Committee's interests and prerogatives regarding this bill or similar legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in the Congressional Record during consideration on the House floor of <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry A. Waxman,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that the Federal Government spends a lot of money on computers and we owe it to our taxpayers to get as much use out of them as we can. <bill type="h" number="752">H.R. 752</bill> will help us do just that. And as you just heard from the sponsor, these are pieces of equipment that no longer are being used but they certainly have great use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I support this measure and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
