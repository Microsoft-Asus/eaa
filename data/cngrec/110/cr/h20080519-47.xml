  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="369">H. Res. 369</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass, structural deterioration of bone, and increased susceptibility to fractures, is a public health threat for an estimated 44 million Americans;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in the United States, 10 million individuals already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone mass, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas one in two women and one in four men over age 50 will have an osteoporosis-related fracture in her or his remaining lifetime;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas building strong bones during childhood and adolescence can be the best defense against developing osteoporosis later;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas osteoporosis is often thought of as an older person's disease, but bone health is a concern for any age;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas substantial risk has been reported in people of all ethnic backgrounds;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas although osteoporosis often has no symptoms in its early stages, a bone mineral density test can be used to assess fracture risk and to establish the diagnosis and severity of the disease in people at risk before they start fracturing their bones;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 2005 osteoporosis was responsible for an estimated 2 million fractures and $19 billion in costs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Surgeon General believes that bone health is critically important to the overall health and quality of the life of Americans; that it is in jeopardy and will only get worse if left unchecked; and that great improvements in the bone health status of Americans can be made by applying what is already known about early prevention, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas optimum bone health and prevention of osteoporosis can be maximized by a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D; weight-bearing exercise; and a healthy lifestyle with no smoking or excessive alcohol intake; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas May 2008 would be an appropriate month to observe National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and ideals of National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month and urges the people of the United States to observe appropriate programs and activities with respect to osteoporosis, including talking with their health care professionals about their bone health.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of House Resolution 369, supporting the goals and ideals of National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I'm proud to offer my support for designating May 2008 as National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass, structural deterioration of bone, and increased susceptibility to fractures. Osteoporosis is a leading cause of fractures, which is of special concern to the aging as it takes longer for older bones to heal than younger Americans. In 2005 alone, osteoporosis was responsible for an estimated 2 million fractures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While osteoporosis is rightly associated with aging, bone health is a concern for people of all ages. In this spirit, House Resolution 369 urges everyone to observe appropriate activities with regard to osteoporosis and to talk with health care professionals about bone health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Shelley Berkley, for her leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor today. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 369, recognizing May as National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osteoporosis is often thought of as an older person's disease, but building strong bones during childhood and adolescence can be the best defense. A healthy lifestyle can lower the chances of having osteoporosis by maintaining a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. It is important that Americans monitor their bone health to ensure that they are not one of the 1.5 million victims of fractures that occur annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given its influence on the risk of fragility, fracture, osteoporosis may significantly affect the quality of life for those who do not know about early prevention, assessment, diagnoses, and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would especially like to thank the author of the resolution, Ms. Shelley Berkley of Nevada, for raising public awareness of osteoporosis. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to the sponsor of this resolution and someone who has been a great leader in bringing attention to the disease of osteoporosis, the gentlelady from Nevada, Shelley Berkley.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to especially single out Chairwoman Schakowsky for her concern and her leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of recognizing May as National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. Osteoporosis and low bone density affect more than 44 million Americans over the age of 50. Many are unaware of their risks for osteoporosis and therefore never take the steps that are necessary and relatively easy to prevent this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many Americans, I had no idea that I was at risk for developing osteoporosis. When I was running for Congress in 1998, I was first diagnosed with this disease. Fortunately, since I received a proper diagnosis, within 10 months of receiving the diagnosis and getting the proper treatment, I was able to stop my bone density loss and my bones actually began to strengthen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it became very apparent to us once I was diagnosed that my two grandmothers more than likely had osteoporosis. As they aged, they became more bent over and they started breaking bones, but we just thought that was part of old age and we never imagined, because in those days you didn't get tested for that sort of thing, that they both probably suffered from osteoporosis as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of my personal experience with osteoporosis, I'm committed to ensuring that Americans are aware of the importance of strong bones so they can reduce their chances of developing the disease, and that's why I have introduced House Resolution 369, the Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Act. Among the resolution's goals  is to bring attention to the importance of building strong bones during childhood and adolescence. Up to 90 percent of peak bone  mass or optimum bone strength is acquired by age 18 in girls and age 20 in boys, which makes childhood and adolescence the best time to invest in your bones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution also addresses the importance of eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, participating in weight-bearing exercises and choosing a lifestyle without smoking or alcohol consumption. Each year, as Chairman Schakowsky has already stated, there are more than 2 million osteoporotic fractures costing about $19 billion a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my fellow citizens to visit their doctors, get screened for osteoporosis; and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and other pieces of legislation that are providing for bone density screening. Rather than cutting this important part of preventative care, we ought to be enhancing it, and I urge support of this resolution and others that affect the health and well-being of our fellow Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support from the other side of the aisle, and I certainly appreciate the leadership of Congresswoman Berkley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, myself, a while ago was diagnosed with a pre-osteoporosis condition, and it's rewarding to find that if you take the medication and you do weight lifting kind of exercises that you can actually reverse the process. Now my screenings indicate that I no longer have those symptoms, although I continue to take the medication and do the exercises. So people should not see it as totally irreversible or untreatable in any way. But most of all, I think the emphasis on prevention is so very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
