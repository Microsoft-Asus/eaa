    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I now yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="s" number="2110">S. 2110</bill>, which names the postal facility in the town of Taft, California, after Larry S. Pierce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2110">S. 2110</bill>, which was introduced in the Senate by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California on September 27, 2007, and passed by the Chamber with unanimous consent on November 16, 2007, was considered and reported out of the Oversight Committee by voice vote on December 12, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bill before us seeks to pay tribute to a great American serviceman by requesting that the postal facility in Taft, California, be renamed in honor of Staff Sergeant Larry Pierce, who lost his life at the young age of 24 while fighting for our country in the Vietnam War. A recipient of the Medal of Honor, Staff Sergeant Pierce stands as a reminder to us all of the great sacrifice our men and women in uniform are making on a daily basis to protect America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues from California in recognizing the contributions of Staff Sergeant Larry S. Pierce and urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise today to honor the memory of Army Staff Sergeant Larry Pierce, a true American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry Pierce was raised in Taft, California. He would have graduated from Taft Union High School in 1959, but he chose to enlist in the Army in 1958. Seven years later, having achieved the rank of staff sergeant, Larry found himself in Vietnam as the squad leader of a reconnaissance platoon. On September 20, 1965, his squad was on patrol when it was ambushed by hostile forces. Thanks to Staff Sergeant Pierce's leadership and courage, the squad successfully repelled the attack, driving the enemy  away. While in pursuit of the enemy, Pierce's squad came across a dirt road. It was on this road Sergeant Pierce discovered an anti-personnel mine. Knowing it would destroy the majority of his squad who was not aware of its presence, Sergeant Pierce threw</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Pierce represents the very best in the tradition of service and selflessness of our Armed Forces. It is fitting that we name this post office in his hometown of Taft, California, in his honor. Surely, his story can live as an example of what it truly means to be a hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to recognize the author of the companion bill that was dropped here in the House, the distinguished colleague of mine from California (Mr. McCarthy) for as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the legislation, <bill type="s" number="2110">S. 2110</bill>, to designate the United States Post Office located at 427 North Street in Taft, California, as the Larry S. Pierce Post Office, the true hometown hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Pierce was born in Oklahoma in 1941. As a young child, his family moved to Taft, California, which I represent today. Sergeant Pierce attended Taft city schools and would have graduated from Taft Union High School with the class of 1959 but decided to serve his country by joining the U.S. Army in 1958.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Pierce served in the 1st Battalion Airborne, 503rd Infantry and the 173rd Airborne Brigade in the Vietnam War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 20, 1965, near Ben Cat in Vietnam, Sergeant Pierce was leading his reconnaissance platoon, was ambushed by hostile forces. Sergeant Pierce and his squad successfully routed the hostile forces from their location. During pursuit of this enemy, Sergeant Pierce heroically sacrificed his own life to save his men. He came upon a road where they found a mine. He threw himself upon it knowing that if this mine went off, it would destroy many and take many lives of his own men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon hearing of this and upon his death, in February of 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Sergeant Pierce the Medal of Honor. In this award, he went on to say for his "inspiring leadership and personal courage," and his "profound concern for his fellow soldiers," acting with "extraordinary heroism, at the cost of his life" and to "great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Pierce would have been 66 years old this year. He is survived by his wife, Verlin, who currently lives in Bakersfield, California; his children, Teresa, Kelley and Gregory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a fitting honor for a Vietnam War veteran who sacrificed his life to save the lives of fellow soldiers by naming the post office in his hometown of Taft in his memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to thank Senator Feinstein for introducing this legislation and for working with me. Taft is a place where Senator Feinstein's own father worked. She knows of the work of Sergeant Larry Pierce, the hometown hero, as many have gone on to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a copy of Staff Sergeant Larry Pierce's Medal of Honor and a copy of the Taft City Council letter of support and resolution requesting the post office in his name.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>A Resolution of the City Council of the City of Taft Requesting Congress of the United States of America To Name the Taft Post Office "The Larry S. Pierce Post Office"</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Whereas, on September 20, 1965, near Ben Cat in the Republic of Vietnam, Larry S. Pierce, while serving as a squad leader, gave the ultimate sacrifice by smothering the blast of an anti-personnel mine with his body to protect his fellow soldiers; and</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Whereas, a portion of the Medal of Honor citation reads, "Through his indomitable courage, complete disregard for his safety, and profound concern for his fellow soldiers, he averted loss of life and injury to the members of his squad.
