    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution to recognize our Native American veterans who have served and continue to serve this Nation with honor and with pride. I represent a county in California, San Diego, that has one of the largest numbers of Native American tribes in our Nation, and I have heard many of their stories. We know that Native Americans have participated with distinction in U.S. military actions for more than 200 years. Their courage, determination,  and fighting spirit are well documented throughout our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is well recognized, also, that Native Americans have the highest record of service per capita when compared to other ethnic groups. Presently, there are almost 200,000 Native American military veterans alive today. At least 18,000 of the 22,000 Native Americans currently in uniform have been deployed at least once to Iraq or Afghanistan as of July of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native Americans who volunteer for military service aspire to uphold their proud cultural tradition. This warrior tradition is a willingness to engage the enemy in battle. This characteristic has been clearly demonstrated by the courageous deeds of our Native Americans in combat. Five Native Americans have been among those soldiers who distinguished themselves by receiving the military's highest award, the Medal of Honor. This medal is given for military heroism "above and beyond the call of  duty." These warriors exhibited extraordinary bravery in the face of the enemy and, in two cases, made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House, led by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, had the enormous privilege of naming two Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in honor of these heroes just last June. Charles George was a member of the Cherokee tribe from North Carolina and private first class in Korea when he was killed on November 30 of 1952. During battle, George threw himself upon a grenade and smothered it with his body. In doing so, he sacrificed his own life, but saved the lives of his comrades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Ernest Childers was a member of the Creek Tribe from Oklahoma and a First Lieutenant with the 45th Infantry Division. He received a Medal of Honor for heroic action in 1943 when, up against machine gun fire, he and eight men charged the enemy. Although suffering a broken foot in this assault, Childers ordered covering fire and advanced up the hill, single-handedly killing the snipers, silencing two machine gun nests, and capturing an enemy mortar observer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The warrior tradition is exemplified by strength, honor, pride, devotion and wisdom. These qualities are a perfect fit with our Nation's proud military traditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the people of our Nation, I urge the Members of this Congress, to make sure we have a day honoring our proud and brave Native American veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is an important resolution, <bill type="hr" number="744">H. Res. 744</bill>, obviously, recognizing the contributions of Native American veterans is important, and asking the President to issue a proclamation urging the people of the United States to also observe a day of honor for Native American veterans. My colleague from California has talked about this. It's interesting; we recognize the contributions of Native American veterans to our society and, of course, by so doing, we are recognizing their achievements,  their singular achievements, if I might add. I compliment the resolution that was introduced by my good friend, the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson), and the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Ms. Herseth Sandlin) for their support and also their prescience for bringing this bill forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have Veterans Day less than a week away, my colleagues. I think it's important this body recognize one often overlooked group of veterans. These veterans have made numerous contributions to the United States military, not just recently in World War II, but as far back as the War of 1812. Currently, there are 195,000 Native American veterans who live in the United States. According to the U.S. Army Center of Military History Web site, there have been 24 Native American Medal of Honor recipients  since the Civil War. Let me just repeat that. There have been, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History Web site, there have been 24 Native American Medal of Honor recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, we know about the Navajo Code Talkers, whose ranks  in the Pacific Theater exceeded 400 during World War II, and in all six Marine divisions from 1942 to 1945. They were credited with saving thousands of lives and actually hastening the end of the war itself. At the time of the war, World War II, fewer than 30 non-Native speakers understood the Navajo's unwritten language. The size and simple complexity of the language made the code  extremely difficult to comprehend, much less decipher. In fact, it was not until 1968 that the United States Government declassified the code. The Japanese never were able to decode this code. So that is a compliment to their accomplishments with the Navajo Code Talkers. In fact, there has been a movie made on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Congress, we have begun to recognize the extraordinary achievement from veterans such as these. This past June, the House passed <bill type="h" number="366">H.R. 366</bill>. This was introduced by Congressman John Sullivan of Oklahoma, naming the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the Ernest Childers Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic. This man was a Native American from the Creek nation, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the House passed <bill type="h" number="2546">H.R. 2546</bill>, which names the Asheville VA Medical Center after another brave Native American, PFC Charles George. He also was honored with the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions in the Korean War. <bill type="h" number="2546">H.R. 2546</bill> was passed last week by the Senate and now is awaiting the President's signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, it is because of the gallant actions of our Native American veterans like those of Lieutenant Colonel Childers and PFC George, as well as the bravery and fortitude of the Navajo Code Talkers who served with the Marines, that I and other Members are proud to sponsor this resolution. We urge its passage. It actually recognizes the many contributions throughout the history of our Nation of our Native American veterans in protecting the freedoms that we enjoy in this country today.  So I encourage all Americans, take time to recognize the sacrifice and achievement of these veterans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="744">H. Res. 744</bill>, which recognizes the contributions of Native American veterans and calls upon the president to issue a day in honor of their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="744">H.R. 744</bill>, I would like to thank Representative WILSON for introducing this important resolution to honor the service of our nation's Native American Veterans. I also would like to recognize Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman BOB FILNER and Ranking Member STEVE BUYER for their strong leadership and unwavering dedication to Native American veterans and for working to quickly move this resolution to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 200 years Native Americans have served in the military--at a higher rate than any other ethnic group. Now, in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new generation of Native Americans serve their country. These young men and women, such as Private First Class Sheldon Hawk Eagle, from Eagle Butte, South Dakota and Corporal Brett Lundstrom from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, who were both killed while serving in Iraq, join a long line of Native Americans that have answered the call to duty on behalf  of their country. Their service to our nation must never be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To honor the sacrifice of countless Native American veterans, like Private First Class Hawk Eagle and Corporal Lundstrom, I encourage my colleagues to support final passage of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 744 and in honor of this country's Native American veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For well over 200 years, Native Americans have provided military and strategic service to the U.S., acting as patriotic soldiers and standing side-by-side their fellow citizens in defense of our country. There are nearly 200,000 Native American veterans in the U.S. today, including members of every single tribe and pueblo. In New Mexico, there are countless stories of heroic Native American men and women serving in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have sponsored earlier legislation to honor Native American veterans. During the 106th Congress, I introduced a bill to honor the Navajo Code Talkers with the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of their dedicated service during World War II. These brave interpreters used their native tongue to carefully transmit confidential Allied messages regarding the movement and strategy of millions of fellow soldiers. Not once was their code broken. Sixty years after their service, these men  were honored in the Capitol Rotunda with the Congressional Gold Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past Congress, I was privileged to sponsor a measure to allow Native American tribes to be eligible for grants to establish state veterans cemeteries on tribal land. This long overdue legislation ensures that those Native American veterans who desire to be buried at home will not have their final wishes denied. I was happy that it was passed and am encouraged that we will soon see the first state veterans cemetery locate on tribal land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, 47 Native Americans have given their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. We honor their memory and their sacrifice by ensuring the Native American veterans who return home and granted the respect they deserve. As we approach Veterans Day later this week, we must remember that Native American have served our nation with pride, and continue to put on the uniform with bravery, honor, and dignity. I urge all of my colleagues to thank all veterans for their service, and to recognize the considerable  sacrifice given by our country's Native Americans.</paragraph>
