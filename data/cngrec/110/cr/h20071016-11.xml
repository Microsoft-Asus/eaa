    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week, I introduced the Combat Troops Tax Relief Act. From Fort Huachuca in Arizona to Iraq and Afghanistan, members of our armed services make the defense of our great Nation their number one priority. With unflinching honor and dedication, our military families inspire us by sending their husbands and their wives and their sons and daughters off to war to protect our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill calls on Congress to honor their patriotism and commitment to the military families with more than rhetoric. This bill would give them concrete tax relief. This Congress is setting new priorities, including policies impacting military families. This bill does more by cutting taxes for middle-class military families. It increases the standard tax deduction for our soldiers and protects military families' eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Tax Credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military families in southern Arizona and across the country deserve nothing less.</paragraph>
