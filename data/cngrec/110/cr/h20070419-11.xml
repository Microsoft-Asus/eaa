    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people want the war in Iraq to end and the troops to be brought home. Why then is this House preparing to capitulate to the Bush White House and let the war continue? We have learned that the Democratic compromise with the President is to make withdrawal timetables nonbinding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the power to end the war now. We should not give the President another dime for the war. We should not permit this war to continue to go on. Yet this House passed a $97 billion supplemental which gives the President money to keep the war going through September of 2008, and then a week later approved the President's budget for another $195 billion for Iraq to keep the war going into 2009. And now we are talking about a nonbinding timetable for withdrawal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans on the war? Well, the Republicans do not want any timetables for withdrawal at all, and the Democrats, well, the Democrats want nonbinding timetables for withdrawal.</paragraph>
