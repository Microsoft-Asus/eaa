    <paragraph>Mr. President, from April 28-30, 2007, more than 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington, DC to take part in the National Finals of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution competition. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by Act of Congress, and is an innovative national educational program developed to educate young people about the Constitution and Bill of Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixteen outstanding students from West Anchorage High School of Anchorage, AK, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to Washington, DC, and compete at the national level. I am proud to announce that these talented young people won the Region One: Western States Award at this prestigious national event. The regional awards are presented to one class from each of the five geographic regions that has the highest cumulative  score during the first 2 days of competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Washington, the students participated in a 3-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they "testify" before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The We the People competition is a rigorous program and students enter prepared to answer tough questions, some of which Americans have been debating since the Constitution was ratified. For example, participants in this year's competition were asked to evaluate the following constitutional principles: States rights--Evaluate the proposal in the Virginia Plan to give Congress the power to strike down state laws that it considered to be in violation of the national constitution or of the national  interest; The rights of the individual--Evaluate the anti-Federalist argument that a bill of rights is as necessary to defend an individual against the majority in a republic as against the king in a monarchy; equal protection--How, if at all, is the concept</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am so proud to recognize the outstanding students from West Anchorage High School, this year's We the People Region One winners:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kristin Baylon, Justin Birchell, Kathryn Braden, Chloe Cotton, Taylor Evenson, Emmaus Finau, Colby Gerik, Matthew Legacki, Elyse Lindsay, Patrick Marcil, Sara Perman, Molly Quinn, Leyna Rynearson, Henrik Strand, Chandra Suriano, and Brianna Thompson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Pamela Orme, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the National Finals. Also worthy of special recognition is Maida Buckley, the state coordinator, and Todd Heuston, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People program in Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate these students on their exceptional achievement at the We the People National Finals.</paragraph>
