  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in an environment of unlimited demands and limited resources, our constituents expect us to make tough choices and set national priorities with their hard-earned tax dollars. The Democrats' Intelligence Authorization bill that we will vote on this week fails to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider the priorities it sets. This bill makes deep cuts in the resources requested by the administration for important intelligence-gathering operations. Meanwhile, it also calls for the Director of National Intelligence to submit a National Intelligence Estimate to Congress on global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a post-9/11 environment, should we really be steering our intelligence community away from intelligence gathering so that they can start studying global warming?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts from the right and the left say that our ability to prevent another attack on America relies heavily on our intelligence capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's fully fund our intelligence community and not distract  it from fulfilling its core mission, to protect Americans from attack.</paragraph>
