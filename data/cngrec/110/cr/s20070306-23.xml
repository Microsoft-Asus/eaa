    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I bring to the attention of the Senate the recent vandalism and desecration of Eugene, OR's only conservative synagogue, Ahavas Torah Synagogue, on February 22, 2007. The targets of this vile act were two sacred Torah scrolls and accompanying prayer books. Police officers responding to neighbors' calls found the building ransacked and a locked wooden chest containing the Torah scrolls pried open; the scrolls themselves were torn and damaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This event comes as a shock to the dozen families who make up Eugene's small Orthodox community, but unfortunately is not an isolated event. In 2002, Temple Beth Israel Synagogue was vandalized during a Shabbat service; in 2001 the congregation received hundreds of hate-filled letters; and in 1994 the synagogue was fired upon with armor-piercing rifle rounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am compelled to speak out against this deplorable act of vandalism at the Ahavas Torah Synagogue, which proves that hate crimes still pose a serious threat to our Nation's security and values. All forms of hatred and intolerance should be combated with every available tool and America's leaders need to send a clear message that acts of violence targeted at individuals of any group will not be tolerated. For this reason, I have been a cosponsor and strong supporter of hate crimes prevention  legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Talmud teaches us that he "who can protest an injustice, but does not, is an accomplice to the act." Even though the existence of hatred is foretold in the Torah, acts of anti-Semitism and hate must be stopped before anyone can truly worship safely and freely.</paragraph>
