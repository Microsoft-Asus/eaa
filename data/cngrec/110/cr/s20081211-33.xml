  <narrative>THANKING STAFF -- (Senate - December 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10931">S10931</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, as Members are leaving, I would be remiss if I did not express my very deep and sincere gratitude to some remarkable people who, like all of us, have staff members who do incredible jobs who never get the recognition they deserve. They worked over these past 8 or 9 days literally until 2 and 3 and 4 in the morning--night after night after night--in an effort to put together a package here that would win the approval of our colleagues. These remarkable young men and  women have just served our country.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin by thanking the staff director of the Banking Committee, Shawn Maher. He is the father of a young 11-year-old boy, and I don't think he has probably seen Aidan much over the last number of months, let alone the last week or so, because he has dedicated himself to the work of this Chamber, this body. So I begin by thanking Shawn Maher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank Aaron Klein, Amy Friend, Dean Shahinian, Neal Orringer, and Deborah Katz; from Senator Reid's staff, Mark Wetjen; from Senator Durbin's staff, Brad McConnell; from Legislative Counsel, Laura Ayoud, who does a remarkable job for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many others, but these are the ones who principally did the work night after night, day after day, nonstop through the weekends, to try to package here a proposal that would win our support. And I apologize to them. We were not able to do it. I feel badly myself that maybe their Members did not probably work as hard as maybe we should have after all the effort they put in. But I want them to know, as we come into this holiday season, there are many people who in this country owe a great  debt of gratitude to these people who worked so tirelessly on their behalf but never get the credit and the recognition they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this evening I thank them immensely for what they have done, and we will be back another day to fight again, and my hope is to make a difference for people in our country. But we all owe them a debt of gratitude, and I am particularly grateful to each and every one of them.</paragraph>
