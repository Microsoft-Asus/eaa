  <narrative>RUNNING IT OUT -- (Senate - June 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5387">S5387</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a unique event occurred in a Philadelphia Phillies baseball game last week. The Philadelphia Phillies' shortstop, named Jimmy Rollins, who was the most valuable player in the league last year, hit a looping ball into left field--which was an easy ball to catch--and instead of running it out, he ran at a very leisurely pace down the first baseline. The left fielder on the defensive team moved in and, in a very unusual play, dropped the ball. Instead of Rollins getting  to second base, he was left at first base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Phillies' manager, Charles Manuel, then immediately benched Jimmy Rollins, the most valuable player in the league. He put him right on the bench because he did not run it out. That took a lot of guts, and manager Charles Manuel has been complimented on that, and I renew the compliment here today. But it is a great lesson, in my opinion, about the way baseball players ought to act and Senators ought to act and everybody ought to act. We all ought to so-called run it out, with that kind of  intensity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am an avid squash player, and one of the maxims I have developed over the years is that I am never too far ahead to lose and never too far behind to win. The game is always in play, if you run it out. I think it has some applicability to all facets of life in things that all people do, in terms of the intensity of their activity. And I think we need a lot more of that attitude in the Senate and a sense of urgency to deal with the people's business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This relates directly to the presentation I made a few moments ago on going back to the rules of the Senate on open debate, open amendment offering, and not filling the tree. But it is a great lesson to have that rule stamped indelibly of "running it out." So I congratulate Charlie Manuel. He took out a key player, whose absence could have been decisive even in that game because of Rollins' hitting and fielding ability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think it is a great message and a great symbol for all of us to "run it out."</paragraph>
