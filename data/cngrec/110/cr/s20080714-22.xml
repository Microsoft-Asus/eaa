    <paragraph>Mr. President, in this body, both sides need to exercise good faith. I appreciate very much what the distinguished Republican leader has been able to work out in the last couple hours. We are going to do our very best. This is a very difficult time we find ourselves in in our country. We have housing matters for which I have had three calls today from the Secretary of the Treasury, and he does not call me very often. It is a very serious situation we have with housing. We are trying  to get the House to do what we think is right for this country. We know the energy issue is right for our trying to do something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, I am going to do my very best. I have expressed to the distinguished Republican leader, unless there is something I do not understand that comes up untoward, we are going to have all those 10 amendments debated and voted upon. And I indicated to the Republican leader that there will be no cloture filed unless he thinks it is appropriate. And if he does not want his fingerprints on it, I will do it on my own, but he will be closely advised of anything we do in that regard.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Republican leader is recognized.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just say to the majority leader, this is a good way to go forward. This consent agreement was rather painfully achieved last week, and I am glad to hear his representation that we will vote on the 10 amendments. I think all of our Members are more than happy to have short time agreements, process the amendments, and move on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Biden and Lugar, I call up the managers' amendment, which Senator Lugar was on the floor wanting to do earlier today, but because of issues he was unable to do that. So this is the substitute amendment.</paragraph>
