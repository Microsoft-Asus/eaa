    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Orwellian democracy is alive and well here in Washington. Our friends on the other side seem to think that if they just say something, it is true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Talk about the budget. We have heard this morning that they are going to balance the budget without raising taxes. Funny thing is, the budget that they passed will do this: Between 2010 and 2011 their budget will raise taxes on ordinary income from 35 to 39.6, capital gains from 15 percent to 20 percent, dividends from 15 percent to 39.6 percent, estate tax, 0 percent to 55 percent. Child tax credit goes from $1,000 to $500, and the lowest tax bracket goes from 10 percent to 15 percent. $400  billion in new taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, they may be saying one thing, but they are doing completely the opposite. They may be able to fool themselves, but they won't fool the American people.</paragraph>
