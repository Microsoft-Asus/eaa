    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of suffragette and abolitionist Martha Coffin Wright. Martha Coffin was born in Massachusetts on Christmas Day 1806, the youngest child of Thomas and Anna Coffin. After her father's death from typhus in 1815, Martha's mother assumed the responsibilities of the family's business, setting an example of an independent, self-reliant woman that would shape Martha's views about the role of women in society. In 1824 Martha Coffin married Peter Pelham.  Soon the couple moved to a frontier fort in Florida where Martha would give birth to her first daughter. Tragically, Peter died 2 years later in 1826 leaving Martha a 19-year-old widow with an infant child. To support herself and her daughter, she moved to Auburn, New York, to teach painting and writing at a Quaker school for girls. Soon after relocating to Auburn, she met and married a law student named David Wright with whom she would have six more children. In July of 1848, Martha's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years following the Seneca Falls Convention, Martha Coffin Wright was also active in the abolition movement. With her sister, Lucretia, she attended the founding meeting of the American antislavery society in Philadelphia in 1833 and later presided over numerous antislavery meetings, including two in upstate New York, in early 1861 that were disrupted by angry anti-abolitionist mobs. Martha bravely opened her home in Auburn to the Underground Railroad in Auburn where she harbored fugitive  slaves. In 1863 Martha and other women's rights activists formed the Women's National Loyal League to carry petitions for the abolition of slavery which would finally be achieved in 1865 with the ratification of the 13th amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the Civil War, Martha was also instrumental in the formation of the American Equal Rights Association, which attempted to merge the issues of black suffrage and women's suffrage; and in early 1874 she was elected president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. In December 1874, Martha took ill with typhoid pneumonia and died in Boston on January 4, 1865, at the age of 68.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Martha Coffin Wright's dedication and commitment should inspire all of us. I am proud to represent the region of upstate New York where Martha Coffin Wright and countless others fought tirelessly for equal rights for all. I am proud to represent the people of Seneca Falls, New York, who established the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1969 to honor the contributions of great American women with a permanent home. I was honored to attend the induction of Martha Coffin Wright into  the Hall of Fame this past weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to represent the birthplace of the women's rights movement, the importance of which was recognized by Congress in 1980 with the creation of the Women's Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to once again join me in honoring the contributions of Martha Coffin Wright and reaffirming the historical significance of Seneca Falls, New York with a voice vote in favor of House Resolution 588 recognizing the achievement of a truly great American, Martha Coffin Wright.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for introducing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Martha Coffin Wright was the quintessential women's rights pioneer long before most women entertained the notion. She, along with her sister, Lucretia, spent their entire lives fighting for basic rights for women. She had a strong, independent mother who served as a powerful role model. In 1848, Mrs. Wright decided, along with others, to hold a convention in Seneca Falls to discuss the need for substantial women's rights. The significance of that first convention was recognized by Congress in  1980 when Women's Rights National Historical Park was created. The bronze statue to Mrs. Wright at the park shows that at the time of the convention she was 6 months pregnant while she participated in the convention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This was particularly remarkable at a time in history when women didn't often go in public as an activist, much less when they were pregnant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the Seneca Falls Convention, Mrs. Wright served as president and in other leadership positions in many other women's rights conventions. Martha Wright was also a fervent abolitionist, and her home in Auburn, New York, was a station on the Underground Railroad. She often allowed fugitive slaves to sleep in her kitchen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Martha Coffin Wright was truly a woman whose significant accomplishments and contributions to both women's rights and civil rights set her apart as a leader and pioneer. Because of these, I rise today to recognize Martha Coffin Wright on the 200th anniversary of her birth and induction into the National Women's Hall of fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="588">H. Res. 588</bill>, a bill that recognizes Martha Coffin Wright on the 200th anniversary of her birth and her induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame. <bill type="hr" number="588">H. Res. 588</bill>, which has 55 cosponsors, was introduced by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) on July 31, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="588">H. Res. 588</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 4, 2007,  by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Martha Coffin Wright was the youngest of eight children, and her sister Lucretia Coffin Mott was the second oldest. The two sisters worked tireless hours as activists for women's rights. Mrs. Wright participated in many State and national women's rights conventions in various capacities, often serving as president. She was also active in the abolition movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With her sister, Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Wright attended the founding meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia in 1833. Later, she presided over many anti-slavery meetings which were often disrupted by angry anti-abolitionist mobs. She used her home in Auburn, New York, as a station on the Underground Railroad to help runaway slaves gain their freedom. Mrs. Wright was a good friend and supporter of Harriet Tubman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for seeking to honor the life and accomplishments of Mrs. Wright and remind us all of what she and other people like her taught, a lesson that we remember even to this day, and that is the primary right that we actually have is the right to struggle. Those who would dare to struggle would dare to be victorious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, again, I commend my colleague from New York (Mr. Arcuri) for his introduction of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="588">H. Res. 588</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
