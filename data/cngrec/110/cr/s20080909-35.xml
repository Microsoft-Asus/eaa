    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and congratulate  the Rapid City Canyon Lake All-Star Little League baseball team. The Canyon Lake All-Stars, under coaches Doug Simons, Steve Nolan, and Jeff Minnick, have the honor of being the first South Dakota team to make it to the Little League World Series, held this year in Williamsport, PA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rapid City Canyon Lake All-Stars went through the Central Regional Tournament with wins over such teams as Kansas, with a final score 15-3, and Iowa, 9-8. They advanced to the Little League World Series where they played the Southeast, New England, and West teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These young people represented Rapid City and South Dakota in an extraordinary fashion. While the final outcome of the Little League World Series was not what these young athletes had hoped for, their hard work and sportsmanship is representative of South Dakota. I would like to give credit to the coaches, parents, supporters, though especially the dedication of these young players. The community of Rapid City will recognize the hard work and sportsmanship this team has shown during the tournament  with a welcome home celebration and parade Saturday. This is a well deserved victory and the team merits acknowledgment for their extraordinary achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize Manager Doug Simons, Coach Steve Nolan, and Coach Jeff Minnick for their guidance and support to help make this year's team so successful. I also want to congratulate all of this year's team members: Logan Anderson, Cale Fierro, Tanner Hagen, Jonah Hanson, William Hendricks, Matthew Minnick, TJ Nolan, Mark Petereit, Jesse Riddle, Tanner Simons, Carter Wevik, Matthew Wilson, and Alec Winter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, congratulations to the Rapid City Canyon Lake All-Stars on fighting their way to the Little League World Series.</paragraph>
