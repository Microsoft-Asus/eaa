  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>As the architect of one of the first children's health plans in the country, I have seen firsthand the success of these public-private, Federal-State partnerships. I am proud of our work here in Congress to make affordable health coverage available to an additional 5 million American children, while also protecting the health needs of our sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic Congress understands the health care challenges facing our Nation's working families. We heard their need and we responded. We passed a plan to expand access to quality, affordable health care for our Nation's children, while ensuring that our seniors receive the care that they have been promised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unacceptable that 47 million Americans, including 9 million children, do not have access to affordable health coverage. It is unacceptable that American seniors are facing limits in access to doctors they trust and treatments they need, and it is unacceptable that President Bush and his allies in Congress are comfortable with that status quo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to act, and Congress has. We call on the President to stop working against us as we move to ensure health care for America's children.</paragraph>
