  <narrative>IN MEMORY OF THE LATE LADY BIRD JOHNSON -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7628]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to announce the passing of a great Texan, Lady Bird Johnson. Lady Bird Johnson was the essence of a lady so much that it was literally her name. She brought grace and light to the State of Texas and in Washington, D.C. She was a partner to President Lyndon Johnson in the home, on the campaign trail and in the White House. She made things around her prettier, around the environment, and she brought light and beauty to Washington, D.C., to politics  and to our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was so proud of the Department of Education bearing the name of her husband, LBJ, to illustrate her dedication to education. Her legacy will live on in their beautiful family and in the flowers and beauty of the many parks that were inspired by her all over the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this moment I would like to yield to my good friend, Lloyd Doggett.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Lady Bird Johnson cared for all that is beautiful and vulnerable in the world. I think every child in a Head Start program, every wild flower gracing our highways is testament to her service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Austin we think of her years as well as after the White House, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, our Town Lake Trail, which families enjoy as a result of her concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers are particularly with her daughters, Lucy Baines Johnson and Lynda Bird Robb, their children, who are themselves a testament to her tradition and public service. And at an appropriate time we would like to ask that the House observe a moment of silence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to my good friend, Mr. Barton.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the dean of the delegation for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the minority Republicans from Texas, simply let us say that we join in our best wishes to Lady Bird's family. I knew Lady Bird through the White House Fellows program. For those of us that were privileged to know her as an individual, she was gracious and charming and an absolute delight to know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope we will do a Special Order tomorrow, but we all join our colleagues wishing the Lyndon Johnson  and Lady Bird Johnson family our sincerest sympathies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me yield for a few seconds to my good friend, Mr. Gene Green of Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding to me. And I want to thank this House, Madam Speaker, because earlier this year we passed a bill and it has been signed by the President naming the Department of Education building for Lyndon Baines Johnson. A lot of our goal was to make sure that Lady Bird was alive when that was done. And it was. When President Bush signed the bill, she actually heard; because of her illness she couldn't be in Washington, but  she heard the bill signing and the great things said about the legacy of President Johnson and the Johnson family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And all of us share the loss of the Johnson family and the loss of Lady Bird. She literally defined the term "lady" for those of us who knew her.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400302" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in Lady Bird Johnson's honor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Will all the Members and visitors in the gallery please rise and observe a moment of silence.</chair>
