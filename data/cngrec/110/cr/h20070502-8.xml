    <paragraph>The President's veto will stand, but now what will we stand for?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We say we want the war to end, but will we give the President the money to continue the war? We say we want our troops home, but will we continue to support the occupation? We know that U.S. contractors have been stealing from U.S. taxpayers and the Iraqi  government, but will we leave our troops in Iraq to protect them? We know oil has had a lot to do with this war, but will we let this President get away with attempting to privatize Iraq's oil wealth  in the name of reconciliation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can still change course. We can deny the administration funds to continue the war. We can bring our troops home. We can stabilize Iraq with an international security force once we end the occupation. That is exactly what <bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill> is about, and it is time that we started to look for alternatives which reflect this Nation's highest aspirations.</paragraph>
