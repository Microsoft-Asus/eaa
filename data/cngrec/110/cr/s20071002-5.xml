  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today each side will have a half hour in morning business. The Republicans have the first half, the Democrats the final half. Following that, the Senate will begin consideration of one of the most important bills we do here every year; that is, the Defense appropriations bill. That will be led by Senators Inouye and Stevens. The Senate will recess today from 12:30 to 2:15 for the regularly scheduled party conference meetings. We want to finish this bill  as quickly as possible and move to Commerce-State-Justice, which is also important, dealing with law enforcement. We also have some judges we would like to get rid of this week, if at all possible. We have a circuit court judge and a number of district court judges. We need to finish these items this week so that we can come back and start the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, which is extremely important. If we finish these two bills, we would have half of them done this year, which is good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have received tremendous cooperation from both sides to move through the bills. I hope we can continue to get that cooperation on this bill. I am confident there will be some amendments offered. Some of them will have points of order against them because of too much money and they are legislating on appropriations bills. Maybe those Senators won't offer them if they check with the Parliamentarian first. But we hope we can move through this bill very quickly.</paragraph>
