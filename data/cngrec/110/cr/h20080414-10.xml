    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a little over a year ago, when the majority party was campaigning to take control of this House, they promised a lot of change, and they made a lot of promises about what they were going to do about gas prices and energy costs and everything else in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, what has that promised change brought us? It has brought us a  43 percent increase in gasoline prices. The price of groceries is going up rapidly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen no results from these empty promises. This is a do-nothing Congress. They accused the Republicans of being a do-nothing Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a do-something Congress involved with a do-nothing because what they have done has been detrimental to our country. They have caused the price of gas to go up 43 percent, the price of groceries to go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a real energy policy, not a lot of empty promises. I call on the majority to let us see some results from those empty promises.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
