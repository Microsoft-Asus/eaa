  <narrative>A resolution (<bill type="sr" number="577">S. Res. 577</bill>) to express the sense of the Senate regarding the use of gasoline and other fuels by Federal departments and agencies.</narrative>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that hits deep at the heart--and pocketbooks--of Americans nationwide: rising gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each and every day, Americans contend with a rapid and inexplicable increase in gasoline prices. Over the last month, the average price of gasoline has increased a penny a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A barrel of oil is at $133.17.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impacts of these increases are staggering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard stories of how individual Americans are coping with the problem of increased gas prices as they conduct their daily lives with their families and in their work environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are finding ways to reduce their consumption of gasoline by driving less, altering daily routines, and even changing family vacation plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, this example of changing family vacation plans is all the more poignant on the eve of what is usually a busy holiday weekend, a holiday that usually sees many Americans traveling by car out of town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, travel over this holiday weekend is expected to be down for the first time since September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line, Mr. President, is Americans are tightening their belts in ways that bring hardships, but save dollars that are necessary to meet essential family needs. And while small in comparison to the overall problem of supply and demand of gasoline, these efforts do add up. I never dismiss the American "can do" spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one word, it is individual conservation. And in cases such as this, when individuals are leading the way, the government should join.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the Sense of the Senate Resolution that I am pleased to offer is to urge the federal government to likewise take initiatives to cut back--even in a small measure--its daily consumption of gasoline and other fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe such a move would signal to Americans that their government is sharing the daily hardships occasioned by this turbulent, uncertain energy crisis.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Presdient, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Warner's legislation that calls on the President to reduce the gasoline consumption of the departments and agencies that he oversees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are seeing American consumers begin to use less gasoline, as prices reach new historic highs almost daily. Many Americans simply cannot afford to maintain their regular driving habits at the moment. This is a situation that we have not experienced in this country in over 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that the Federal Government show its solidarity with the American people in this time of economic hardship. Just as individual citizens are finding ways to use less gasoline, the U.S. Government should also be finding ways to reduce consumption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the Executive Branch is by far the largest branch of Government, it is important that the President take the lead on this issue. As the Federal Government spends less money on fuel, we send fewer American taxpayers' hard earned dollars to oil-exporting countries. That is a goal I know we can all agree is laudable under any circumstance, but even more so now, as fuel costs continue to soar.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <chair>The resolution (<bill type="sr" number="577">S. Res. 577</bill>) was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>The preamble was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>
    <bill type="sr" number="577">S. Res. 577</bill>
  </chair>
  <chair>Whereas each day, as Americans contend with rising gasoline prices, personal stories reflect the ways in which--</chair>
  <chair>(1) family budgets are suffering; and</chair>
  <chair>(2) the cost of gasoline is impacting the way Americans cope with that serious problem in family and work environments;</chair>
  <chair>Whereas, as a consequence of economic pressures, Americans are finding ways to reduce consumption of gasoline, such as--</chair>
  <chair>(1) driving less frequently;</chair>
  <chair>(2) altering daily routines; and</chair>
  <chair>(3) even changing family vacation plans;</chair>
  <chair>Whereas those conservation efforts bring hardships but save funds that can be redirected to meet essential family needs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, just as individuals are reducing energy consumption, the Federal Government, including Congress, should take steps to conserve energy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a Government-wide initiative to conserve energy would send a signal to Americans that the Federal Government--</chair>
  <chair>(1) recognizes the burdens imposed by unprecedented energy costs; and</chair>
  <chair>(2) will participate in activities to reduce energy consumption; and</chair>
  <chair>Whereas an overall reduction of gasoline consumption by the Federal Government by even a few percentage points would send a strong signal that, as a nation, the United States is joining to conserve energy: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the President should require all Federal departments and agencies to take initiatives to reduce daily consumption of gasoline and other fuels by the departments and agencies.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express on the record my appreciation to Senators WARNER and BINGAMAN for this most important resolution that just passed. It expresses the sense of the Senate that Americans are contending with rising gasoline prices. Their personal stories reflect the ways in which family budgets are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of gas is impacting the way Americans cope with problems within the family and, therefore, we need to find ways to reduce consumption of gasoline. This is directed toward the President. I hope he will review this. We have a lot of problems with our economy, many of which are a direct result of the cost of a barrel of oil being $130.</paragraph>
