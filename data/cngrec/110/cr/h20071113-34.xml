    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell), the author of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Mr. Davis for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to congratulate an inspirational young woman from my district, Shawn Johnson, the daughter of Doug and Terri Johnson of West Des Moines, Iowa, who recently won the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastic Championship, which took place in Stuttgart, Germany. At the age of 15, Shawn has achieved more and seen more than many high school students dream of. She has done it all while maintaining her status as an honor student alongside her friends at Valley High.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shawn has traveled the world, winning title after title. This past July, she won five medals at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. Winning the 2007 Visa championships in San Jose, California, made her the United States champion in gymnastics. On September 9, Shawn became the world all-around champion, taking home three gold medals at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While her shows are exciting and full of grace, one of the most inspiring things about her championship is that Shawn is shaping history. Having joined an elite group of women gymnasts, Shawn is one of only four American women to win the 40-year-old competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shawn has impressed many around the globe and has made Iowans incredibly proud. She is reminding us how important hard work and dedication are. In honor of Shawn's accomplishments, Governor Chet Culver declared October 17 Shawn Johnson Day in Iowa, and we are extremely proud to join my fellow Iowans in congratulating Shawn and thanking her for making history in the great State of Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shawn's positive attitude to achieve has taken her to amazing places. I suspect she's not quite finished. Promising to be ready for the Beijing Olympics, she told a reporter that she would "put in 100 times more effort and hopefully come back with another gold."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, congratulations Shawn, and good luck at future competitions. You make me proud, you make our congressional district proud, you make your school in west Des Moines proud, you make our State of Iowa proud, and you make our country proud. We wish you continued success. On to the Olympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope that everyone will support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I rise and urge passage of <bill type="hr" number="684">H. Res. 684</bill>, congratulating Shawn Johnson on her recent national championship in women's artistic gymnastics. Just this year, Shawn has won the all-around competition at the Pan American Games, the American Cup, the national championship and the world championship. She has appeared on "ABC World News Tonight," "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and at a gala for Pink With a Twist, a group that fights cancers among women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has been honored with Shawn Johnson Day in Iowa, with the Longines Prize for Elegance, and as ABC's Person of the Week. All this for a 15-year-old, 4-foot 8, 88-pound high school sophomore who sometimes finds time to walk dogs at shelters and serves as a ball girl for her school's football team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She never bothered to crawl, according to her mother, Terri Johnson. At 9 months old she simply arose and began to walk. At age 3, her mother enrolled her in gymnastics class "just to channel all her energy," her mom said. I think it's important to point out that it was her mom who drove her so many times to so many practices, because with all great athletes, we have to acknowledge that the parents play such a great role in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 6, she showed up at Qiao Gymnastics in Des Moines, where Qiao was working. A former top gymnast from China, Qiao had come to the United States to study English at the University of Iowa. Although her first coach said that she had more raw strength than gymnastic ability, Coach Qiao saw her potential immediately and worked hard to nurture that talent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This means long and busy days for Shawn. After school, she heads to the gym for a 4-hour workout, then home to do school work. Yet, she maintains a 4.0 average. Unlike traditional gymnasts, artistic gymnastics traditionally has not been a sport where 15-year-olds excel. It combines the disciplines of gymnastics and ballet, and few athletes as young as Shawn have been able to master it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But through hard work, discipline and the ability and the tutelage of a good coach, she has already made her mark as one of the world's greatest gymnasts. With Pan Am, national and world titles behind her, Shawn now points towards 2008 to the summer Olympics to be held in Beijing. "I think it would be cool, not only for me, but for him," she said, "and I think it would be a proud moment for both of us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I want to say to my colleagues is this is a special young woman and one that I know everyone in Iowa has a lot of pride in, but everybody in the United States shares in that pride, and I urge passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="684">H. Res. 684</bill>, a bill that congratulates Shawn Johnson on her victory in becoming the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Champion in women's gymnastics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="684">H. Res. 684</bill>, which has 57 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative LEONARD L. BOSWELL on September 26, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="684">H. Res. 684</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 23, 2007, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Ms. Shawn Johnson, at the age of 15, won three gold medals at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. She became the fourth United States woman ever to win a world all-around title with her come-from-behind victory in the women's all-around finals of the 2007 world championships. She joined Kim Zmeskal, Shannon Miller and Chellsie Memmel as the only U.S. women to win a world all-around title in gymnastics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, Ms. Johnson was first at the 2007 Tyson American Cup. She won the all-around title at the 2007 Pan Am Games, along with the U.S. women's gymnastic team, receiving gold metals for the uneven bars and balanced beam events. She also won the silver medal for the floor exercise event. At the 2007 Visa Championships, she won her first senior U.S. all-around title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Boswell, on congratulating the outstanding accomplishments of Ms. Johnson in becoming the 2007 World Gymnastics Champion in women's gymnastics and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="684">H. Res. 684</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
