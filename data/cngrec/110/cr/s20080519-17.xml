  <narrative>Overview</narrative>
  <narrative>The administration's request for fiscal year 2008 emergency supplemental funding for military construction associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan encompasses a wide range of initiatives both in the Central Command [CENTCOM] Area of Responsibility and within the United States. Several of these requests, including additional funding for child development center construction at U.S. military installations and funding for the construction of Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices [CIED] training  ranges at U.S. bases, were not included in the President's October 2007 supplemental budget amendment, but were subsequently proposed by the administration. Although not part of the official budget request, and therefore not reflected as such in the tables accompanying this report, the Committee finds merit in many of the proposals and has recommended funding for them.</narrative>
  <narrative>Iraq and Afghanistan.--The administration's request for military construction funding in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations in the Central Command Area of Responsibility totals $1,590,950,000, of which $976,150,000--61 percent--is for construction in Iraq alone.</narrative>
  <narrative>Given the pressing need for infrastructure investment within the United States, the Committee has closely examined the entire CENTCOM construction request, with particular attention to Iraq. The Committee is mindful of the ongoing operational requirements and continued security concerns facing U.S. military personnel in Iraq, and has recommended funding for projects that reflect these priorities. With the exception of funding for certain items, such as landfills and incinerators, intended to  expedite the closure of U.S. bases in Iraq, the Committee has continued to limit military construction funding to those bases in Iraq that are intended to be enduring locations.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee remains strongly opposed to the permanent basing of U.S. military forces in Iraq, and has again included bill language prohibiting the obligation of funds appropriated for military construction in Iraq until the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Committee that none of the funds are to be used to establish permanent military bases in Iraq. The Committee is also concerned with the impact that a future Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq could have on the current strategic plans  and associated construction program to consolidate U.S. forces in Iraq into eight enduring locations. In an effort to provide a blueprint on which to establish a basing agreement, the Secretary of Defense is directed to provide to the Committee, no later than 30 days after enactment of this act, an updated Master Plan</narrative>
  <narrative>Child Development Center Initiative.--Recognizing the importance of quality child care resources for military families, the Committee has been very supportive of accelerating the construction of child development centers on military installations. In the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, Congress added more than $100,000,000 over the President's budget request to fund 13 additional child development centers at U.S. military  bases. The Committee, therefore, supports the Department's proposal to use emergency supplemental funding to advance the construction of 20 child development centers currently programmed for construction in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. The Committee further recommends that the 11 child development centers included in the President's fiscal year 2009 budget request also be advanced into the supplemental funding bill to ensure that the most urgently needed centers are among the first to be funded.</narrative>
  <narrative>Army Barracks Improvements.--The Committee is deeply concerned about the deplorable conditions that have been uncovered in some permanent party Army barracks, including those which house soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army created a Permanent Party Barracks Modernization Program in 1994 to eliminate inadequate barracks. However, this program is not projected to be completed until 2013. Given this timeline, it is unacceptable that the Army has allowed existing  permanent party barracks to fall into such abject disrepair. This is not the way the Committee expects the Army to treat its soldiers returning from combat. While many of the repairs and upgrades to existing barracks can be accomplished with Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization [SRM] funds, the Committee believes that additional Military Construction funds should be allocated to address</narrative>

  <narrative>1,170,200,000&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends $1,170,200,000 for Military Construction, Army, instead of $1,440,750,000 as requested. In addition to funding projects directly in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the recommendation includes $137,200,000, to remain available until September 30, 2012, for the construction of 15 child development centers at U.S. Army installations as proposed by the administration. Funds for Military Construction, Army, are provided as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Various Locations, Iraq.--The Army requested a total of $183,000,000 for construction of five powerplants in Iraq which the congressional defense authorizing committees declined to authorize in Public Law 110-181, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The Committee endorses the position of the authorizers, that the construction of powerplants at these locations is premature and of primarily long-term benefit, and does not recommend funding for them. The Committee  also recommends no funding for several additional Army requests for Iraq, including a warehouse and helicopter parking apron at Camp Speicher, totaling $66,000,000, and $72,000,000 for several projects, including a gym, dining hall, base exchange, and housing units, intended to upgrade Camp Delta in southeastern Iraq to an enduring Contingency Operating Base [COB]. The Committee questions the justification for increasing the number of enduring U.S. military bases in Iraq from eight to nine at a time when the goal of U.S. military and administration officials is to reduce the level</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends $300,084,000 for Military Construction, Navy and Marine Corps, instead of $237,505,000 as requested. The recommendation includes $29,299,000, to remain available until September 30, 2012, for the construction of two child development  centers at U.S. Navy and Marine Corps installations, as proposed by the administration. Funds for Military Construction, Navy and Marine Corps, are provided as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Camp Lemonier, Djibouti.--In accordance with the action of the congressional defense authorizing committees, and in keeping with concerns the Committee has expressed in the past regarding uncertainty over the future role of Camp Lemonier in the Africa Command [AFRICOM], the Committee does not recommend funding two projects at Camp Lemonier requested by the Navy, including a permanent construction dining facility and headquarters building, totaling $50,549,000. However, the Committee  recognizes that basic utility and operational ground infrastructure is required to execute the current expeditionary mission at Camp Lemonier, and therefore recommends funding three projects that were authorized but not funded in the regular fiscal year 2008 military construction appropriations act. These projects include two taxiways and a fuel farm totaling $22,290,000.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends $361,900,000 for Military Construction, Air Force, instead of $305,000,000 as requested. The recommendation includes $37,600,000, to remain available until September 30, 2012, for the construction of three child development centers at U.S. Air Force installations, as proposed by the administration. Funds for Military Construction, Air Force, are provided as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Masirah Air Base, Oman, and Al Udeid, Qatar.--The Committee does not recommend funding for two projects requested by the Air Force, including $6,300,000 for an expeditionary beddown site at Masirah Air Base and $40,000,000 for facilities replacement at Al Udeid. These were among the projects that the congressional defense authorizing committees did not authorize in the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends $1,202,886,000 for the Department of Defense Base Closure Account 2005, instead of $415,910,000 as requested. The funds include $415,910,000 to expedite construction of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Maryland. The Committee recommends an additional $786,976,000 for the Base Closure Account 2005. This amount, along with the $7,235,591,000 appropriated in Public Law 110-161, fully funds the construction requirements included  in the administration's base closure request for fiscal year 2008.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommendation includes $437,100,000 for Construction, Major Projects, for the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA].</narrative>
  <narrative>Polytrauma Center Initiative.--The nature of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted in new patterns of polytraumatic injuries and disabilities requiring specialized intensive rehabilitation and high coordination of care. The VA health care system, through its polytrauma network, continues to provide significant expertise in the treatment and rehabilitation of both active duty and separated Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans suffering from polytraumatic  injuries. Operating under a national memorandum of agreement with the Department of Defense [DOD], VA polytrauma rehabilitation centers have provided treatment and rehabilitation care to severely injured combat personnel requiring polytrauma inpatient rehabilitation.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Department of Veterans Affairs currently operates four Level 1 polytrauma rehabilitation centers within existing VA hospital facilities. In fiscal year 2007, Congress provided emergency funding for the VA to establish a fifth Level 1 polytrauma rehabilitation center. The care that the VA is providing military personnel wounded in combat is exceptional. However, space in the existing facilities is generally inadequate, with cramped quarters and treatment facilities scattered throughout hospital  campuses. These inefficiencies are particularly difficult for patients with mobility issues, compromised immune systems, and those suffering from psychological wounds. In an effort to accelerate the VA's planned expansion and consolidation of polytrauma rehabilitation centers on existing hospital campuses as outlined in the department's February 2008 Five Year Capital Plan, the Committee recommends providing $437,100,000 to fully fund the design and construction of these crucial projects.</narrative>

  <narrative>Subchapter A--Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2008</narrative>
  <narrative>Introduction</narrative>
  <narrative>The budget request totals $6,547,408,000 in emergency supplemental funds for fiscal year 2008, and the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161) provided $1,473,800,000 for immediate requirements. The Committee recommendation for Department of State and Foreign Operations totals $5,254,608,000, which is $181,000,000 above the pending budget request.</narrative>

  <narrative>Committee recommendation</narrative>
  <narrative>1,413,700,000&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The budget request included $2,283,008,000 for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, of which $575,000,000 was appropriated in the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161) for operations and security at the United States Embassy in Iraq.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends an additional $1,413,700,000 for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, which is $294,308,000 below the pending request. Within the amount provided, $212,400,000 is for worldwide security protection. Funds for diplomatic and consular programs are to be allocated as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Afghanistan.--The Committee recommends $195,200,000, which is $32,800,000 above the request, for necessary expenses for diplomatic and security operations in Afghanistan. Of this amount, $162,400,000 is for enhanced security operations, including additional high threat protection teams, increased overhead cover and physical security measures, replacement of armored vehicles, and local guard service. In addition, $14,000,000 is for the establishment of a Department of State-managed air  transport capability in Afghanistan for Department of State and United States Agency for International Development [USAID] personnel, primarily for medical evacuation and other security-related operations. Finally, $18,800,000 is for support of operations and personnel for Provincial Reconstruction Teams [PRTs] in Afghanistan.</narrative>
  <narrative>Iraq.--The Committee recommends $1,095,000,000 for the diplomatic and security operations of the United States Embassy in Iraq, which is $450,608,000 below the pending request. The cost of operations of the United  States Embassy in Iraq totals $2,086,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 including $1,095,000,000 provided in this act, $575,000,000 provided as bridge funding in Public Law 110-161 and $416,000,000 in funds carried over from prior year appropriations.  Of this amount, nearly $900,000,000 is for supporting security requirements for diplomatic and development personnel in Iraq.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee provides funding for Embassy operations, security, logistics support, information technology and operations of PRTs. Congress has provided an additional $196,543,000 since fiscal year 2006 for additional facilities requirements identified by the Department of State, as follows: extend the perimeter wall; construct a dining facility; construct additional housing; construct a tactical operations center for Diplomatic Security; construct a static guard camp; and construct overhead  cover. The actual cost of building the New Embassy Compound [NEC] has reached a total of $788,543,000 to date.</narrative>
  <narrative>The number of permanent and temporary personnel assigned to Iraq, with the exception of USAID, should be decreased to accommodate all personnel within the NEC and any improvements which can be made with previously appropriated funds. USAID will play a critical role in assisting the Government of Iraq in effectively allocating its budgetary resources.</narrative>
  <narrative>The additional $43,804,000 requested for follow-on projects for the NEC in Baghdad is not included. At least $77,027,000 in prior year funding programmed for follow-on projects is available for obligation and these funds should be used to provide secure housing for a smaller number of personnel.</narrative>
  <narrative>None of the funds provided under this heading in this act shall be made available for follow-on projects, other than the proposed funding for overhead cover. The Department should include a detailed plan for the use of funds for follow-on projects as part of the spending plan required by this act.</narrative>
  <narrative>Due to an extended accreditation and verification process and the addition of follow-on projects, occupancy of the NEC offices and housing has been delayed. This rigorous process to address and validate whether the NEC was constructed to code and contract specifications was supported. Now that the process is complete, occupancy of the offices and housing should proceed without delay in order to provide the maximum protection to United States personnel.</narrative>
  <narrative>The benefits of co-location of the Departments of State and Defense in the NEC is recognized. However, the proposed New Office Building and the Interim Office Building reconfigurations are projected to delay occupancy of NEC offices by up to 1 year. Given the difficult security environment in Baghdad, this lengthy delay is not acceptable. The Departments of State and Defense are expected to consult with the Committees on Appropriations on options for moving forward with limited co-location plans  in the most accelerated, secure, and cost effective manner. Any future construction in Iraq shall be subject to the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program, in the same manner as all other embassy construction projects worldwide.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is a concern that private security contractors have been utilized without the necessary authority, oversight, or accountability. The Department of State is directed to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after enactment of this act on the implementation status of each of the recommendations of the October 2007 report of the Secretary of State's Panel on Personal Protective Services. The Department of State is encouraged to aggressively review security  procedures and seek the necessary authority to ensure that increased security is achieved with effective oversight and accountability.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee directs that not later than 90 days after enactment of this act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations detailing efforts taken by the Department of State to establish a U.S. Consulate in Lhasa, Tibet and a description of actions by the Government of the Peoples Republic of China to undermine support for Tibet in the United States, including in the media, academia, and political arenas.</narrative>
  <narrative>Local Guard Forces--Worldwide Security Protection.--The Committee recommends $50,000,000 above the request for worldwide security protection.

  <narrative>The Committee provides funds to replace Foreign Service positions worldwide which were previously moved to Iraq and to increase the number of positions participating in critical needs foreign language training. The Department of State has transferred approximately 300 Foreign Service positions from embassies around the world to Iraq and to associated language training, leaving key posts understaffed. These funds are to be used to support United States foreign policy in priority, understaffed  regions, particularly South and East Asia, the Western Hemisphere, and Africa.</narrative>
  <narrative>Funds made available for the civilian stabilization initiative are for the Active and Standby Response Corps portion of the initiative and to enhance operations of the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. In addition to the funds provided to the Department of State, $25,000,000 is appropriated in this act under the heading, "Operating Expenses of the United States Agency for International Development" to implement the USAID portion of the civilian stabilization initiative.  The funding request for the Civilian Response Corps will be considered as part of the fiscal year 2009 appropriations process and none of the funds provided in this act are to be used to implement the Civilian Response Corps portion of the initiative.</narrative>
  <narrative>Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.--The Committee recommends not less than $1,000,000 to expand public outreach efforts related to implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative [WHTI]. With WHTI implementation occurring as early as June 2009, there is concern with the lack of a comprehensive, coordinated plan between the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Postal Service to broadly disseminate information to the traveling public  concerning the final WHTI implementation requirements at the Nation's land and seaports. The Department of State is encouraged to provide significantly increased outreach to border communities, including through radio, print media, and additional passport fairs.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends an additional $149,500,000 for Operating Expenses of the United States Agency for International Development.</narrative>
  <narrative>Of the funds provided under this heading, the Committee recommends $41,000,000 to continue support for security needs in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is the same as the request.

  <narrative>The Committee also recommends $25,000,000 to support the development and deployment of a civilian capacity to respond to post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction needs. Funds made available for the civilian stabilization initiative are for the Active and Standby Response Corps portion of the initiative and none of the funds provided in this act may be used to develop the Civilian Response Corps. Additional funding for this initiative is provided in the "Diplomatic and Consular Programs"  account for the Department of State portion of the initiative.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the Committee recommends $35,000,000 to enable USAID to hire above attrition in fiscal year 2008. The administration's request for fiscal year 2009 includes $92,000,000 for hiring 300 USAID foreign service officers as part of a 3-year initiative. Funding provided in this act is intended to support the hiring of at least 100 additional Foreign Service officers in fiscal year 2008 in order to begin rebuilding the capacity of the Agency to carry out its mission. USAID is directed to  consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the use of these funds and to recruit mid-career personnel. As USAID seeks to strengthen its workforce, USAID is encouraged to consult with the Department of Defense on ways to benefit from the experience of retiring officers, including establishment of a transition program.</narrative>

  <narrative>The budget request included $2,217,000,000 for Economic Support Fund [ESF], of which $208,000,000 was provided in the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161) for emergency requirements in the West Bank and in North Korea, as requested.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends an additional $1,962,500,000 for ESF, which is $46,500,000 less than the request. Of the funds requested under ESF, $75,000,000 is provided under the heading Democracy Fund for political development programs for Iraq. Funds are to be allocated as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Iraq.--The Committee recommends $398,000,000 for Iraq, which is $399,000,000 below the request. The sums provided should enable the Department of State and USAID to continue programs in Iraq through the end of fiscal year 2008 and into the first two quarters of fiscal year 2009.</narrative>
  <narrative>After providing more than $45,000,000,000 to help rebuild Iraq, the United States should seek to reduce bilateral assistance levels, and correspondingly to reduce the number of Department of State personnel involved in the reconstruction effort who are located in Iraq.</narrative>
  <narrative>Funds provided for Iraq are to be allocated as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Afghanistan.--The Committee recommends an additional $899,000,000 for Afghanistan, which is $65,000,000 above the request.</narrative>
  <narrative>USAID is directed to review its reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan; focus its assistance, including capacity building, through local Afghan entities; give greater attention to accountability and monitoring to minimize corruption; and emphasize programs which directly improve the economic, social, and political status of Afghan women and girls. Funds provided for Afghanistan are to be allocated as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Bangladesh.--The Committee recommends $25,000,000 for assistance for Bangladesh for cyclone recovery and reconstruction assistance.</narrative>
  <narrative>Central America.--The Committee recommends $40,000,000 for Central America in fiscal year 2008, in addition to funds otherwise made available for assistance for countries in Central America for a program to be called the "Economic and Social Development Fund for Central America", to be administered by USAID in consultation with the Department of State. The purpose of the program is to promote economic and social development and good governance in low-income areas, including rural communities,  that are vulnerable to drug trafficking and related violence and organized crime. These funds should support programs that emphasize community initiatives and public-private partnerships. United States funds should be matched with contributions from other public and private sources to the maximum extent practicable. USAID is directed to consult with the Committees on Appropriations prior to the obligation of these funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>Democratic Republic of the Congo.--The Committee recommends $15,000,000 for assistance for eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo for urgent conflict mitigation and recovery programs and for programs relating to sexual violence against women and girls. Of this amount, $1,000,000 is to establish and support a training center for health workers who provide care and treatment for victims of sexual violence, and $2,000,000 is for training military and civilian investigators, prosecutors,  and judges to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jordan.--The Committee recommends $150,000,000 for economic assistance to Jordan, which is $150,000,000 above the request. The Government of Jordan remains a key ally and has played a leading role in supporting peace initiatives in the Middle East. Programming of these funds should be done in consultation with the Government of Jordan and refugee relief organizations and should be used to meet the needs of Iraqi refugees. The Committee directs the Secretary of State, after consultation  with the Government of Jordan, the United Nations, and  international organizations and non-governmental organizations with a presence in Iraq, to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after enactment detailing (1) short and medium term options the United States and other countries and organizations could pursue to</narrative>
  <narrative>Kenya.--The Committee recommends $12,000,000 for assistance for Kenya for political, ethnic and tribal reconciliation activities.</narrative>

  <narrative>North Korea.--The Committee recommends up to $53,000,000 for energy-related assistance for North Korea in support of the goals of the Six-Party talks, which is the same as the request. This is in addition to the $53,000,000 appropriated in division J of Public Law 110-161.</narrative>
  <narrative>Pakistan.--The Committee recommends $60,000,000 for assistance for Pakistan, which is the same as the request.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Philippines.--The Committee recommends $15,000,000 for assistance for the Philippines for programs to further peace and reconciliation in the southern Philippines, and recognizes the shared interest between the United States and the Philippines in ending terrorism in this region.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sri Lanka.--The Committee recommends $6,000,000 for assistance for Sri Lanka to be provided through USAID to support economic development programs in the eastern region of Sri Lanka to solidify recent gains against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. These funds should be used to assist Tamil and Muslim minorities in Sri Lanka.</narrative>

  <narrative>Thailand.--The Committee recommends $2,500,000 for assistance for Thailand to address economic and social development needs in southern Thailand. The Department of State is directed to consult with the Committees on Appropriations prior to the obligation of these funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>Uganda.--The Committee recommends $22,000,000 for assistance for northern Uganda. These funds should be used to support economic development, governance, assistance for war victims, and reintegration of ex-combatants.</narrative>
  <narrative>Vietnam.--The Committee recommends $2,000,000 for assistance for Vietnam to continue environmental remediation and health activities at former United States military sites in Vietnam that are contaminated by dangerously high levels of dioxin. The Department of State is directed to consult with the Committees on Appropriations on the uses of these funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>West Bank.--The Committee recommends not more than $200,000,000 for economic assistance for the West Bank, which is the same as the request.

  <narrative>Chad.--The Committee recommends $1,000,000 for democracy activities in Chad.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends an additional $470,000,000 for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, Mexico, Central America, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the West Bank, which is $264,000,000 below the request.</narrative>
  <narrative>Iraq.--The Committee recommends $85,000,000 for Iraq for justice and rule of law programs, which is $74,000,000 below the request. Funding for prison construction is not included.</narrative>
  <narrative>Central America.--The Committee recommends $50,000,000 for assistance for Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, and an additional $10,000,000 for Haiti and the Dominican Republic under the Merida Initiative. Impunity within the military and police forces of several of these countries is of concern, and their justice systems are corrupt and ineffective. The Secretary of State is directed to submit a report, prior to the obligation of funds, on mechanisms  to ensure adequate monitoring of these funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee directs the Secretary of State to submit a report not more than 90 days after enactment of this act detailing efforts by the Guatemalan Government to propose and promote legislation to raise the necessary revenues in Guatemala to fund comprehensive judicial and law enforcement reform.</narrative>
  <narrative>The omission of Haiti and the Dominican Republic from the request for the Merida Initiative makes it more likely that these vulnerable countries would become increasingly favored transit routes for drug traffickers. The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for Haiti and $5,000,000 for the Dominican Republic to support counternarcotics, border security, anti-corruption and rule of law programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mexico.--The Committee recognizes there is a shared responsibility between the United States and Mexico to combat drug trafficking and related violence and organized crime. The Committee provides $350,000,000 to support programs to enable the Government of Mexico to respond to these threats in accordance with the rule of law, a portion of which is funded with unobligated balances from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee also recognizes that corruption and impunity within Mexico's military and police forces are pervasive. Additionally, Mexican law enforcement and intelligence agencies have frequently persecuted legitimate groups for engaging in peaceful dissent. Recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission are often ignored and investigations of violations of human rights by Mexican military and police forces rarely result in convictions. The recommendation requires the Secretary of State  to report to the Committees on Appropriations prior to the obligation of funds that mechanisms are in place to ensure proper vetting of recipients of United States assistance. Additionally, the Committee provides that a comprehensive database for vetting military and police forces shall be established by the United States Embassy in Mexico City and continually updated.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is concern with the failure to investigate and prosecute the police officers responsible for human rights violations, including rape and sexual violence against women, at San Salvador Atenco on May 3-4, 2006, and in Oaxaca between June and December 2006. These and other such violations by members of the Mexican military and police forces have been documented and require thorough, credible and transparent investigation and prosecution by the Mexican Attorney General. The State and Federal  investigations into the October 27, 2007, killing in Oaxaca of American citizen Bradley Will have been flawed and the Secretary of State is directed, not later than 45 days after enactment of this act and 120 days thereafter, to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations detailing progress in conducting a thorough, credible, and transparent investigation to identify the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice.</narrative>
  <narrative>One of the benefits of the Merida initiative is that the wireless radio equipment and identification systems being provided will enable the Government of Mexico to more closely collaborate with United States agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. To maximize the potential for collaboration, the Committee recommends that any equipment and technology purchases should be interoperable based on open standards with  the equipment and technology being used by their United States Government counterparts.</narrative>
  <narrative>West Bank.--The Committee provides $25,000,000 for ongoing training of vetted units of the Palestinian National Security Forces, which is the same as the request.</narrative>

  <narrative>The budget request included $230,000,000 for Migration and Refugee Assistance, of which $200,000,000 was provided in the State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161) for emergency refugee requirements in Iraq and the West Bank.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends an additional $330,500,000 for Migration and Refugee Assistance, which is $300,500,000 above the pending request. Funds should be made available to meet unmet global refugee needs, including to assist Iraqi refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and the surrounding region, as well as internally displaced persons in Iraq. Funds may also be used, if necessary, for the admissions costs of Iraqis granted special immigrant status under the Special Immigrant Visa  program  authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008. In addition, funds may be used to offset administrative costs associated with the expanded requirements of the Iraqi refugee program, in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations.</narrative>
  <narrative>The humanitarian crisis involving Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons is of concern and the Government of Iraq has dedicated insufficient resources to assist this most vulnerable segment of the Iraqi population. The Department of State is directed to urge the Government of Iraq to provide a substantial increase in funding for humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi refugee population residing in the region and within the country. In addition, the Secretary of State should ensure that  the Senior Coordinator for Iraqi Refugee Issues gives particular attention to the needs of vulnerable minority groups.</narrative>
  <narrative>The welfare and security of the 7,900 Lao Hmong in the Thai military camp in Petchaboon, northern Thailand is of concern and the Government of Thailand is urged to support a transparent screening process to identify those who have a legitimate fear of return to Laos. Any attempt to force the return of Hmong refugees to Laos is strongly opposed.</narrative>

  <narrative>Food and Drug Administration</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends $265,000,000 for Food and Drug Administration, Salaries and Expenses to remain available until September 30, 2009. The Committee directs FDA to provide quarterly reports through December 31, 2009, on the status of the funding, including, but not limited to, expenditures and hiring by program, and significant accomplishments, including operations in foreign countries, enhanced inspection activities, scientific advances, and information technology improvements.</narrative>
  <narrative>Of the amount recommended, $125,000,000 shall be used for activities related to food protection. The funding shall be used to open additional FDA offices overseas and improve FDA's capacity to identify risk factors and more rapidly mitigate any food safety problems. This includes more rapid detection of contamination and more rapid trace back abilities to determine the source of any outbreak of food borne illness. Further, this funding will be used to hire additional foreign and domestic inspectors  to increase the number of import food exams, the number of foreign food facility inspections and the number of domestic food safety inspections; and to create a new communication system to more rapidly inform the public of any outbreak of food borne illness.</narrative>
  <narrative>Of the amount recommended, $100,000,000 shall be used for activities related to drug, device, and biologics safety. The funding shall be used to increase foreign and domestic facility inspections, improve laboratory infrastructure and rapid analysis tools, implement the safety requirements outlined in  the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, and upgrade the agency's information technology to enable data sharing and enhanced analysis of adverse  events.</narrative>
  <narrative>Of the amount recommended, $40,000,000 will be used to enhance science programs across the agency, with specific focus on areas of emerging science where the FDA currently lacks the expertise necessary to regulate complex products under development. This will include funding for research, science training and professional development for current FDA staff, and efforts to recruit additional scientific staff to the agency.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends $10,000,000 for FDA to bring agency laboratories outside of the Washington region in line with public health safety standards.</narrative>
  <narrative>Bureau of the Census</narrative>
  <narrative>2008 appropriation to date</narrative>
  <narrative>$1,027,406,000</narrative>
  <narrative>2008 supplemental estimate</narrative>
  <narrative>...........................</narrative>
  <narrative>Committee recommendation</narrative>
  <narrative>210,000,000&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The bill includes $210,000,000 for increased costs associated with the poor management of the 2010 decennial census. Within the funds provided, not less than $50,300,000 shall be used to restore funding associated with the approved March 26, 2008 reprogramming within the Bureau of Census. Funds transferred pursuant to the reprogramming to address immediate shortfalls within the Field Data Collection Automation contract from the American Community Survey, Census Coverage Measurement activities,  and other census activities may result in increased risk and other unintended consequences to other parts of the census. The $50,300,000 shall be available solely to complete previously planned activities and address vacancies in the aforementioned areas in order to reduce risk and ensure a successful 2010 decennial census.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Census Bureau shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives, within 30 days of enactment of this act, a detailed plan showing a timeline of milestones and expenditures for the 2010 decennial census, and shall include a quantitative assessment of the associated risk to the program as it is currently constituted. In addition, the inspector general shall submit quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations, until the conclusion of the  2010 decennial census, detailing the progress of the revised plan for the execution of the 2010 decennial census and any unanticipated slippages from the revised 2010 milestones, as well as reassessing the associated risk to the program. The Census Bureau is directed to provide the inspector general with any required information so that the quarterly reports can begin 60 days after submission of the plan.</narrative>
  <narrative>Because rising costs associated with the 2010 decennial census and the Department's and the Bureau's lack of contract oversight are cause for particular concern, the recommendation includes not less than $3,000,000 for the Department's Office of the Inspector General for census contract oversight activities and not less than $1,000,000 solely for a reimbursable agreement with the Defense Contract Management Agency to review and improve Census contract management.</narrative>
  <narrative>United States Marshals Service</narrative>

  <narrative>$866,523,000</narrative>
  <narrative>2008 supplemental estimate</narrative>
  <narrative>...........................</narrative>
  <narrative>Committee recommendation</narrative>
  <narrative>50,000,000&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>In order to implement and enforce the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Public Law 109-248), the United States Marshals Service requires funding to hire and equip at least 200 Deputy Marshals and at least 25 associated administrative personnel each year for the next 5 years. This funding is critical and necessary to establish the National Sex Offender Targeting Center, improve the information technology backbone, and reinforce the agency's infrastructure so that Deputy Marshals have  timely, accurate investigative information to track down and arrest those who prey on our Nation's children. The Committee is deeply concerned that no additional resources have been requested or provided by the Department of Justice to undertake this mission as required under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.</narrative>

  <narrative>2008 supplemental estimate</narrative>
  <narrative>...........................</narrative>
  <narrative>Committee recommendation</narrative>
  <narrative>178,000,000&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends $178,000,000 for additional costs of the Bureau of Prisons [BOP] related to the custody and care of inmates and the maintenance and operation of correctional and penal institutions. The BOP has been chronically underfunded in recent budget requests, due to consistently underestimated growth in inmate populations and inadequate funding requests for medical expenses. As a result, BOP facilities face rising staff-to-inmate ratios, placing corrections officers and inmates  at unacceptable risk of violence. The bill includes funding for FCI Pollock activation costs and for inmate drug abuse treatment required by law. The administration is urged to re-estimate BOP fixed costs and prisoner population for fiscal year 2009 and to provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with those estimates no later than May 31, 2008. Further, the BOP is directed to notify the Committees of current staff-to-inmate ratios at all Federal prisons on a monthly basis.</narrative>

  <narrative>...........................</narrative>
  <narrative>Committee recommendation</narrative>
  <narrative>590,000,000&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends $490,000,000 for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants. Byrne grant funding is the single most important Federal resource for cops-on-the-beat in our States and local communities. This funding goes by formula to State and local police forces to help them prevent, fight, and prosecute crime.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee notes that the President's annual budget requests have repeatedly proposed to cut drastically and eliminate Byrne grant funding. Each time, the Committee has rejected the President's proposals. In fiscal year 2008, the Senate-passed Commerce, Justice, Science [CJS] bill provided $660,000,000 for Byrne grants. But because of the President's veto threats, Byrne funding was reduced to just $170,000,000 in the final 2008 omnibus bill, $350,000,000 below the 2007 level, and $490,000,000  below the level included in the Senate-passed CJS bill for 2008. The Committee has heard from State and local police around the country that the consequences of these funding cuts will be fewer cops on our streets fighting gangs, drugs, and child predators and fewer prosecutions of criminals. This is unacceptable</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, the Committee recommends $100,000,000 for competitive grants for programs that provide assistance and equipment to local law enforcement along the Southern border or in High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas to combat criminal narcotic activity stemming from the Southern border, of which $10,000,000 shall be for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Project Gunrunner.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends $200,000,000 to address costs associated with the return to flight of the space shuttle. As a result of the loss of the space shuttle Columbia, NASA has experienced significant costs associated with the repair of the remaining shuttle fleet. This has caused serious budget and programmatic disruption to NASA's core programs. The Committee has provided transfer authority to the Administrator to fund programs that were cut as a result of shifting budget priorities  related to the return to flight. The Administrator shall submit a spending plan to the Committee for this funding within 30 days of enactment of this act.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends $150,000,000 for research and related activities at the National Science Foundation [NSF]. The Committee strongly supports the need to increase funding for all research disciplines at NSF and believes that it will maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy, provide security, and enhance the quality of life. Within the recommendation the Committee provides $10,000,000 for the National Academic Research Fleet which is experiencing reduced research capacity due  to rising fuel costs.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends $50,000,000 for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM] scholarship programs at the National Science Foundation [NSF]. STEM education is critical to our future economic prosperity. The National Academy of Sciences' report "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" recommended increasing the number of students earning degrees in the physical sciences in order to energize America for a brighter economic future. The recommendation includes an additional: $20,000,000  for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program to expand the program as authorized by the America COMPETES Act (Public Law 110-69); and $24,000,000 for Graduate Research Fellowships; $5,000,000 for Graduate  Teaching Fellowships; and $1,000,000 for Federal Scholarship for Service.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends $5,000,000 for Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup. The Committee has been informed that legal obligations contained in compliance agreements and consent orders will not be met simply because of a lack of funding in fiscal year 2008. Additionally, the Committee has learned that the cleanup workforce will be reduced due to funding shortfalls. This increase provides a stimulus to support the workforce around the complex as well as meets milestones in existing compliance agreements.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee recommends an additional $100,000,000 for Science. The Committee is aware that the final fiscal year 2008 appropriation was essentially flat with fiscal year 2007 in many areas of the Science budget. The result of flat funding shows up in reduced hours of operation of equipment and facilities, reduced service to users, staff layoffs, reductions to education and training programs, and other negative impacts. This increase to fiscal year 2008 funding will restore the jobs of 10 to  30 people who were terminated and prevent the reduction of 200 additional employees.</narrative>
  <narrative>Specifically, $55,000,000 is for Fusion Energy Sciences and $45,000,000 is for High Energy Physics.</narrative>

  <narrative>The Committee has not recommended the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity, West Bank and Vicinity and Southeast Louisiana projects be combined into a single project to be cost shared 65 percent Federal and 35 percent non-Federal as proposed by the administration with a resulting Federal cost of $2,835,000,000 and a non-Federal cost of $1,527,000,000. The Committee believes that the three authorized projects can be constructed as a coherent hurricane protection system without modifying the individual  project authorizations or cost shares resulting in a Federal share of $3,047,000,000 and a non-Federal share of $1,315,000,000 that will be initially federally funded. This $4,362,000,000 shall not be available until October 1, 2008. The Committee has recommended $1,657,000,000 for the Lake Ponchartrain and Vicinity project; $1,415,000,000 for the West Bank and Vicinity Project; and $1,290,000,000 for the Southeast Louisiana projects.

  <narrative>($2,926,000,000)</narrative>
  <narrative>Committee recommendation</narrative>
  <narrative>3,368,400,000&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee has recommended the full administration request of $2,926,000,000 for the work related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, for consistency, the funding has been recommended in the same elements as requested by the administration and appropriated in Public Law 109-234 rather than as a lump sum as proposed by the administration for this request. This $2,926,000,000 shall not be available until October 1, 2008. The Committee has recommended $704,000,000 to modify the 17th Street,  Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue drainage canals and install pumps and closure structures at or near the lakefront; $90,000,000 for storm-proofing interior pump stations to ensure the operability of the stations during hurricanes, storms, and high water events; $459,000,000 for armoring critical elements of the New Orleans hurricane and storm damage reduction system; $53,000,000 to improve protection at the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal; $456,000,000 to replace or modify certain non-Federal levees in Plaquemines Parish to incorporate the levees into the existing New Orleans to Venice hurricane protection project; $412,000,000 for reinforcing or replacing flood walls, as necessary, in the existing Lake</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee remains concerned that plans under development for permanent pumping of storm water in the New Orleans metropolitan area do not fully account for the operational challenges that arise during major storm events and are not, therefore, fully protective of public safety.</narrative>
  <narrative>After reviewing the report furnished in response to section 4303 of Public Law 110-28, the Committee has concluded that Option 1, as presented therein, presents unacceptable risks given that it relies on old equipment and technology that is less reliable, it requires synchronized operation of multiple pump stations by both local and Federal agencies during high flood flow or storm events creating operational complexity and requires operation and maintenance of more systems that would be true  in Option 2.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the report the Corps states that "Option 2 is generally more technically advantageous and may be more effective operationally over Option 1 because it would have greater reliability and further reduces the risk of flooding." The Corps further states that "Discharge of storm water directly to the Mississippi River (Option 2a) would reduce the size of the new pump station required at the lake and would reduce the magnitude of the canal modifications required to accommodate gravity flow in  the 17th Street system."</narrative>
  <narrative>Given these conclusions and the severe consequences of a failure relating to loss of life and property, the Corps is directed to continue the NEPA alternative evaluation of all options with particular attention to Options 1 and 2 and 2a and within 90 days of enactment of this act provide the House and Senate Appropriation Committees cost estimates to implement Options 1, 2 and 2a of the above cited report.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommendation includes $348,000,000 for barrier island restoration and ecosystem restoration along the Mississippi gulf coast. This $348,000,000 shall not be available until October 1, 2008. This restoration will help to restore the historic levels of storm damage reduction to the Mississippi gulf coast that these islands once provided. These funds are provided at full Federal expense as these islands are a part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and are publicly owned and managed  by the Department of the Interior.</narrative>
  <narrative>Due to recent natural disasters, the Corps of Engineers has identified a number of projects that have been damaged by storm and flood events. The Committee has recommended $94,400,000 for the Corps to prepare for flood, hurricane and other natural disasters and support emergency operations, repairs, and other activities in response to flood and hurricane emergencies, as authorized by law; to repair and rehabilitate eligible projects that were affected by natural disasters; and to fund claims  processing and discovery costs associated with Hurricane Katrina lawsuits.</narrative>

  <narrative>The congressional budget resolution (<bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>) agreed to by Congress for fiscal year 2007 includes provisions relating to the notification of emergency spending. These provisions require a statement of how the emergency provisions contained in the bill meet the criteria for emergency spending as identified in the budget resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Committee recommends emergency funding for fiscal year 2008 for overseas deployments and other activities, for hurricane recovery in the gulf coast region, and other natural disasters, and for other needs. The funding is related to unanticipated needs and is for situations that are sudden, urgent, and unforeseen, specifically the global war on terror and the hurricanes of 2005 and other natural disasters. The recommendation also funds the costs of ongoing military deployments and other requirements  through the beginning months of the next fiscal year. These needs meet the criteria for emergencies.</narrative>
  <narrative>Overview</narrative>
  <narrative>In title XI, chapter 1, total new appropriations of $99,505,877,000 are recommended. A detailed review of the recommendations for programs funded in this chapter is provided in the following pages.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommended supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense are intended for ongoing military and intelligence operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF], Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF], and the larger global war on terror [GWOT]. The recommendations in this chapter are based on the initial budget request, an update to that request, formal hearings, and numerous briefings and are intended to address emergency, high-priority needs of the United States military and intelligence  community. In some cases, funding has been reduced or eliminated for certain activities that are either not emergency in nature; that cannot be obligated and/or executed in a timely fashion; or which involve new policy and program decisions that should be addressed in the regular authorization and appropriations bills for fiscal year 2009.</narrative>
  <narrative>The following table summarizes by appropriation account or general provision, the recommendation:</narrative>
  <narrative>Additionally, a number of needs were identified that were not adequately addressed by the Department of Defense. Major initiatives in the recommendation include:</narrative>
  <narrative>Overall, the recommendations total $99,505,877,000 and are structured to maximize support to our men and women in uniform. They meet important force protection, equipment and personnel needs, while fully funding the operational requirements to conduct the global war on terror.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendations for intelligence activities are published in a separate and detailed classified annex. The intelligence community, Department of Defense and other organizations are expected to fully comply with the recommendations and direction in the classified annex accompanying this act.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the congressional defense  committees within 30 days of enactment of this act on the allocation of the funds within the accounts listed in this chapter. The Secretary shall submit updated reports 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter until funds listed in this chapter are no longer available for obligation. The Secretary is directed that these reports shall include: a detailed accounting  of obligations and expenditures of appropriations provided in this chapter by program and subactivity group for the continuation of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and a listing of equipment procured using funds provided in this chapter. It is expected that, in order to meet unanticipated requirements, the Department</narrative>
  <narrative>Additionally, the Department of Defense is directed to submit monthly supplemental execution reports to the congressional defense committees that include the following information by appropriation: funding appropriated, funding allocated, monthly obligations, monthly disbursements, cumulative fiscal year obligations, and cumulative fiscal year disbursements.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall provide a report on the progress of the Department of Defense efforts to plan for and provide support to civil authorities during incidents of national significance as required by sections 1814 and 1815 of Public Law 110-181. The report shall be provided to the Committees on Appropriations and other congressional defense committees no later than 60 days after enactment of this act. Specifically the report  shall provide a projected timeframe for completing the determination of requirements requested in sections 1814 and 1815, milestones for implementation of planning and readiness improvements, and any available information on the Department of Defense's current state of readiness and gaps in readiness</narrative>
  <narrative>There is concern over the numerous instances of waste, fraud, and abuse that have occurred in Department of Defense contracting activities in support of contingency operations. The Department and the military services did not properly address the necessary personnel, training, and technology requirements over the years, but are now taking steps to improve their capabilities. This recommendation includes additional funds to further many of the initiatives and increased personnel requirements identified  by the Department of Defense and outside reviews such as the Gansler report. The recommendation also calls for enhanced reporting requirements to ensure improved oversight over the Iraq and Afghanistan Security Forces Funds, and the Commander's Emergency Response Program. Finally, it provides funding for the Department of Defense Inspector General to improve its antiquated tracking system for the Criminal Investigation Service.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation provides additional resources to aid U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and to strengthen the Afghanistan Security Forces. Afghanistan Security Forces are critical to the stability of Afghanistan and essential to our fight against al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. To increase our efforts to train and equip these forces, the recommendation funds additional trainers for the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police. It also doubles the Commander's Emergency  Response Program [CERP] in Afghanistan from fiscal year 2007 levels to address critical small scale humanitarian efforts. Included in this amount are the necessary resources to support the CERP program for the additional marines in Afghanistan. These and other efforts related to Afghanistan are discussed elsewhere in this report and in the classified annex.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $94,900,000 in the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide; Procurement, Defense-Wide; Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide; and the Defense Health Program appropriation accounts to address gaps identified by the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. The funding will enable improvements in case management, data sharing, and the disability evaluation system [DES]. Additionally, the funding will support the ongoing  DES Pilot program, information technology development, support for case management, and improvement of Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs data sharing gateways, and distribution of wounded warrior care and benefits informational handbooks.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes a total appropriation of $1,488,864,000 for the Defense Health Program. This funding will provide medical and dental services to active forces and mobilized Reserve Components, as they support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, and their family members. The funding also provides for costs associated with the treatment of combat-related injuries.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation also provides $293,023,000 for facilities sustainment, restoration and maintenance; $1,000,000 for the Center of Excellence for Eye Injuries; $70,000,000 for the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine and $47,100,000 in various budget activities for disability evaluation system and case management.</narrative>
  <narrative>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation has historically not been funded in large amounts in emergency supplemental appropriations. Generally, funding has been provided for items that have been funded in prior supplemental appropriations, or that can be developed and fielded in a timely manner to impact the global war on terror.</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $18,065,599,000 is recommended for Military Personnel.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendations for each military personnel account are shown below:</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes funding to support the Army and Marine Corps plans to grow their end strength in an effort to better sustain operational tempo and relieve strain on current units.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation fully funds the identified requirements for enhanced Traumatic Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance [TSGLI] benefits and wounded service members' separation pay, and provides additional funding for health care professional bonuses to support the recruitment of additional medical personnel.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes funding for recent increases for Basic Allowance for Housing, Basic Allowance for Subsistence, Permanent Change of Station, Unemployment Compensation, and Cost of Living Adjustments.</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $34,425,336,000 is recommended for Operation and Maintenance.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendations for each operation and maintenance account are shown below:</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $1,226,841,000 for the Commander's Emergency Response Program [CERP]. Included in this amount is $479,900,000 for CERP in Afghanistan and $2,000,000 to support our ongoing efforts in the global war on terror in the Philippines. Small scale, humanitarian projects led by the Joint Interagency Task Force--Philippines should have a tremendous impact on combating the spread of terrorist cells in the Philippines. However, the provision of these funds does not represent an  invitation to expand CERP beyond its current mission and application.</narrative>
  <narrative>CERP projects are also currently benefiting the 2.7 million internally displaced Iraqis. The Iraqi Government should devote more of its own resources to returning them to their homes, or resettling them permanently in functioning communities. However, recognizing that CERP is an effective tool for meeting urgent humanitarian needs, the Secretary of Defense is urged to encourage commanders to give priority to humanitarian and reconstruction projects that respond to the needs of internally displaced  Iraqis who have settled in their area of responsibility.</narrative>
  <narrative>CERP has proven beneficial to both U.S. commanders and the Iraqi people, but there is concern over the Department's growing requests for these funds. Since its inception in 2004, this program has grown exponentially, from $180,000,000 in fiscal year 2004 to $956,400,000 in fiscal year 2007. The total fiscal year 2008 level of $1,726,841,000 as recommended, represents an 80 percent increase for the program. Congress provided $500,000,000 in the fiscal year 2008 supplemental bridge appropriation  but the Department is obligating funds for this program at a rate that would exceed the authorized level of $977,441,000 before the end of the fiscal year.</narrative>
  <narrative>While there is a need to maintain commanders' flexibility and control in administering CERP funds, there is concern that, in the absence of any minimum standards for project monitoring or specific performance indicators, commanders exercise varying levels of oversight and typically compile only anecdotal evidence on the impact of projects. Furthermore, CERP funds are administered at the battalion level, often by troops whose Military Operational Specialty has little or no connection to program  or acquisition management. The limited information provided to Congress about CERP projects makes it difficult to conduct thorough oversight over how this program is administered, what its actual impact is on the Iraqi people, and how it fits into our overall strategy for Iraq.</narrative>
  <narrative>To provide Congress sufficient visibility over the use of funding provided for CERP, the Department is directed to: (1) establish minimum guidelines for commanders to follow in monitoring project status and performance indicators to assess the impact of CERP projects, (2) provide more complete information in its quarterly reports to Congress, including: listings of projects by province; project status, such as completed and being used, completed but not sustained, destroyed, vandalized, or not  found; the source of each individual initiative, whether it was generated by a local national or the command; the name of the authority or organization who serves as the primary local partner for each project; and the number of local citizens who will benefit from the project, including the number who will be employed in implementing it, and</narrative>
  <narrative>So Congress may better understand how troops are trained to administer CERP funds, the Secretary of Defense is directed to submit to the congressional defense committees, within 45 days of enactment of this act, a detailed report on the training provided to troops authorized to manage or disperse CERP funds. The report should include the duration of the training, its primary objectives, and a syllabus of the training course.</narrative>
  <narrative>For greater clarity on how commanders incorporate the use of CERP funds into their operational planning, the Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the congressional defense committees, no later than September 4, 2008, on operational planning for the use of CERP. The report should include plans from each of the current Multinational Division [MND] commands in Iraq and each of the current Task Force commands in Afghanistan, to include information on the criteria used for prioritizing  individual CERP projects and how the use of CERP funds is intended to advance the tactical and strategic objectives.</narrative>
  <narrative>The continued lack of transparency and accountability with regard to contracts and contractors serving in both theaters of operation (Iraq and Afghanistan) is concerning. The Department of Defense has indicated a need for approximately $40,000,000,000 of operation and maintenance funding for contracted services in this supplemental appropriation. This includes $6,000,000,000 for the Army-managed Logistics Civil Augmentation Program [LOGCAP], which provides for a spectrum of services to include  power generation, management of facilities, dining operations, latrines, water systems, fire protection and laundry services. Approximately $5,400,000,000 was expended by the Army on LOGCAP contracts in 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a comprehensive report to the House and the Senate Committees on Appropriations that provides the following information for each existing operations and maintenance contract in excess of $1,000,000: contractor name; amount; purpose; start and end date; type of contract; and amount of awards per fiscal year, if applicable.</narrative>
  <narrative>This report should also identify the Department of Defense organization responsible for oversight of the contracts and should reflect the type of services provided, such as vehicle maintenance, food service, security, information technology support, reconstruction, analysis, and other relevant information.</narrative>
  <narrative>This report should also include a discussion of the roles and responsibilities of the following organizations and how they work collaboratively to ensure appropriate contract oversight in theaters of operation for Iraq and Afghanistan: LOGCAP; AFCAP; Defense Reconstruction Support Office; Joint Contracting Command Iraq/Afghanistan; Deputy Assistant Secretary--Army (Policy  and Procurement)--Iraq and Afghanistan; and Project and Contracting Office, Washington.</narrative>
  <narrative>Further, the report should include the number of Department of Defense military and Federal civilian personnel assigned to each of these offices, the number of contractors assigned to each office and the roles the contractors perform.</narrative>
  <narrative>As part of this report, should the Department of Defense determine that it has insufficient in-house capability to effectively monitor these contracts, it should then develop a robust staffing proposal and submit it to the House and the Senate Committees on Appropriations for consideration in the fiscal year 2009 Defense Appropriations Act. The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified annex.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Army requested $987,000,000 to fund purchases of subsistence items in support of Department of Defense civilian employees and contractors deployed to the Iraq and Afghanistan areas of operations. This also includes subsistence that is provided to these individuals within the Department of Defense dining facilities.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Army estimates that 5,000 Department of Defense civilians and 73,000 contractor personnel constitute the population of "Department of Defense authorized personnel". This is an average cost for subsistence of nearly $13,000 per individual per year.</narrative>
  <narrative>There are significant unanswered questions regarding the management of this overall process, as well as the absence of appropriate internal control procedures. For example, how the Department manages access to the dining facilities; the number of civilian employees and contractors who dine in Department of Defense dining facilities; why the cost per person is so high; and the number of contractors and subcontractors who provide subsistence to the Department of Defense in this theater of operations.</narrative>
  <narrative>Based on these unresolved issues, the recommendation includes a 10 percent reduction to the nearly $1,000,000,000 request for this program to encourage better management and accountability of subsistence funds. Currently the Department's Cost of War Report does not account for obligation of funds for subsistence. The Secretary of Defense is directed to, within 90 days of enactment of this act, submit a comprehensive report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and the Senate which:</narrative>
  <narrative>The Office of Management and Budget's [OMB] influence over the Department of Defense's public-private competitions is concerning. Section 325 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 110-181) prohibits OMB from directing or requiring any initiation, continuation, or completion of a public-private competition or the Department taking action based on such an OMB direction or requirement. Questions have been raised as to whether this provision is being implemented. If OMB continues  to influence public-private competitions and contracting out of Federal employees at the Department of Defense stronger provisions may be warranted.</narrative>
  <narrative>The impact to the Army and Marine Corps of rebasing activities, particularly as large numbers of service members return from overseas bases to the continental United States [CONUS], must be addressed. The recommendation provides $408,000,000 to the Army's Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization program and $92,000,000 to the Marine Corps' Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization program to offset the growing infrastructure costs associated with the global repositioning  of forces. These funds will be used to repair barracks, improve child care facilities, and enhance community services at Army and Marine Corps bases throughout the United States.</narrative>
  <narrative>The supplemental funding requested in the operation and maintenance accounts is largely a function of anticipating operating tempo for continuation of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq through September 2008. The actual operating tempo in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 has differed from the estimated levels. Therefore, the recommendation provides operation and maintenance funding to account for the actual operating tempo.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes no funding for the Combating Terrorism Readiness Fund because the requirement was funded through the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-116).</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes an additional $76,450,000 in Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide to accelerate the fielding of ISR capabilities to Special Operations Command for use in missions pertaining to high value targets. The Secretary of Defense is urged to include sustainment costs for these items in future budget requests.</narrative>
  <narrative>Primary lithium batteries have been and remain a critical consumable warfighting asset for our military. A reliable and sustainable U.S. manufacturing source for these supplies is critical to maintaining the full warfighting capability of our military forces. The Defense Logistics Agency is encouraged to take the necessary actions to ensure that at least one supplier of LiSO</narrative>
  <narrative>2 batteries and one supplier of LiMnO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>2 batteries continue manufacturing in the United States with a reasonable sustaining rate of production.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DEFENSE THREAT REDUCTION AGENCY</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes no funding for NIMBLE ELDER because the requirement was funded through the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-116).</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $50,000,000 for family advocacy programs to provide counseling and family assistance including child psychologists, Parents as Teachers and other intervention efforts. This funding will enhance the activities of the Family Advocacy Program [FAP] and provide for children and families managing the difficult challenges of military service. There is concern about the growing need for family members to have access to professional counseling to help alleviate the mental  stresses associated with deployments. These activities provide programs, products and services to help mitigate the disruption and stress in the military family when a service member is deployed, killed or seriously wounded.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes no funding for Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 because the requirement was funded through the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-116).</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $800,000,000 for coalition support funds and $200,000,000 for lift and sustainment in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also includes an additional $150,000,000 for the Global Train and Equip Program. The Department of State is tasked to train and equip allied nations for counterterrorism operations, yet the Department of Defense continues to request funds to augment these efforts due to the global war on terror. Training allied nations is primarily the responsibility of the  Department of State. As such, the administration is urged to request the appropriate level of funding for the Global Train and Equip Program entirely within the Department of State in the next fiscal year.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is deep concern over the waste, fraud, and abuse that has occurred in the Department's contracting activities that support contingency operations overseas. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics [USD(AT&amp;L)] is tasked with contractor oversight in forward areas of operations. In an effort to further many of the initiatives developed by USD(AT&amp;L), the recommendation includes additional resources to fully fund these requirements, including: $8,000,000  for the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker [SPOT], $2,500,000 for the Joint Contingency Contract Support Office [JCCSO], $2,000,000 for Military Non Contracting Officer Training, and $400,000 for the Materiel Readiness Board [MRB]. The recommendation also includes $3,000,000 for the Wartime Contracting Commission, established by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 (Public Law 110-181), and $1,200,000 for the WMD Commission.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $50,000,000 for the Iraq Freedom Fund only for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations--Iraq to execute the Factory Restart Program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Reprogramming.--The Department of Defense has been provided significant flexibility in executing this program in the past but new reprogramming procedures are required at this juncture. With respect to the Iraq Security Forces Fund and the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Department is directed to submit prior approval reprogramming requests to the congressional  defense committees for proposed transfers of funds in excess of $20,000,000,  to the Infrastructure subactivity groups or other construction related projects.</narrative>
  <narrative>Infrastructure.--The Department of Defense is directed to provide the congressional defense committees with a detailed report by August 1, 2008 on current and future infrastructure requirements for the Iraq and Afghanistan Security Forces. The report shall detail all infrastructure projects that have been previously funded, projects that are planned, and projects that require future funding from either the United States or the Governments of Iraq and Afghanistan. The projects shall be  broken out by Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior requirements, year or projected year of funding, source of funding, and current status of project.</narrative>
  <narrative>Logistics.--The Iraq Security forces will not be able to operate independent of coalition support unless they have an organic logistics capability of their own. The Department of Defense is directed to provide the congressional defense committees with a report no later than 30 days after enactment of this act, on the plan for an independent logistics capability within the Iraq Security Forces. The plan should address required support facilities at the national, regional, and base levels,  motor transport capabilities, life support self sufficiency, logistics training, mechanics training, ammunition re-supply (decentralization, distribution, and security), fuel (decentralization, distribution, and security), medical supply and services, and depot warehousing, maintenance, and capacity. The report should also include a resource plan to reach these goals.</narrative>
  <narrative>Trainers.--There is deep concern that the Department of Defense has only been able to resource 44 percent of the required trainers for the Afghan National Army and only 39 percent for the Afghan National Police. While progress is being made on training and equipping these forces, the shortfall of capable trainers severely hampers our ability to further this momentum. There are enormous demands for this low density skill to support this mission, and the recommendation provides the Department</narrative>
  <narrative>Poor quality pistols were provided to the Afghan National Police and the Afghan National Army in 2005 and 2006. While they have no record of manufacturing defects in service, the 5,000 pistols purchased for the Afghan National Army, and the 51,175 purchased for the Afghan National Police, under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, through the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command, lack important features desired in a quality service pistol. A key missing feature is a positive external safety  mechanism, although the pistol does have a trigger safety. It appears that there were two prominent motivations for selection of the current 9mm pistol. The first was cost, and for the Afghan National police, the second key consideration was the fact that the pistol already was in service with the Afghan National Army. Based on concerns expressed by U.S. trainers, ongoing procurements of pistols under 2007 and 2008 contracts are delivering a pistol manufactured with the desired features that were lacking in the pistols procured in 2005 and 2006. Future purchases will be made by competitive bid and the requirements will specify features consistent with the U.S. M9 service pistol. The government agencies of the United States and Afghanistan are commended for having made these appropriate adjustments in the acquisition of pistols for the Afghan</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $42,006,355,000 is recommended for Procurement.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendations for each procurement account are shown below:</narrative>
  <narrative>Urgent needs have been identified in certain Army aviation programs. Accordingly, the recommendation provides additional funding as follows: $30,000,000 for UH-60A to UH-60L modifications, to remanufacture 30 aircraft; $14,650,000 for UH-60 aircraft safety enhancements; $38,000,000 for Kiowa Warrior Safety Enhancement program; and $196,100,000 for Army fixed and rotary wing aircraft survivability enhancements in infrared countermeasures.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is strong support for the Army plan to replace the aging Kiowa Warrior fleet with Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters [ARH] as soon as possible. However, the funding provided in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 fully funded the ARH production capacity for fiscal year 2008. Accordingly, the recommendation includes no additional funding for the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program.</narrative>
  <narrative>Numerous concerns have been raised about continued procurement of the M4 carbine. These concerns range from performance issues (such as jamming in dusty environments) to the current sole source contract. The Army recently conducted tests on the M4 and similar weapons in the same class to assess its performance. The Army is also evaluating the capability of the M4 and other weapons to determine if a new performance requirement is needed. To allay the concerns regarding performance and competition  in contracting, the Secretary of the Army is directed to provide a report to the congressional defense committees no later than June 15, 2008, on the findings of the recent comparative capability assessment and with a determination as to whether a change in the acquisition strategy is needed.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $793,600,000 for the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles program. This funding level includes $94,000,000 to reimburse the program for funds that were used under rapid acquisition authority to procure Sky Warrior intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $500,347,000 for the procurement of SINCGARS radios, which will fully fund Army SINCGARS radio requirements for fiscal year 2008. However, the Army has yet to fully address certain issues including concerns of the Army Science Board regarding SINCGARS compatibility with the Joint Tactical Radio System [JTRS], encryption modernization, and compatibility with local first responder radios. The Army is urged to move forward with a plan that addresses these and other urgent  tactical radio issues.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Army has recently updated the acquisition strategy for the SINCGARS family of radios and has released a market survey seeking sources of supply that are compliant with the operational requirements. The Army is encouraged to implement "best value" selection criteria in any upcoming competition where the operational requirements are stated as the minimum needed and advanced capabilities and features would be evaluated according to the value they bring above that minimum functionality level.  Not more than 60 days after enactment of this act, the Secretary of the Army shall provide a report and briefing to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate addressing the acquisition objective; encryption modernization and capability enhancement; alignment with the JTRS program; and a procurement plan that includes a strategy for full, fair and open competition.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Navy has recently grounded 39 P-3 Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft due to wing cracking discovered during inspections. These aircraft have logged significant hours flying in support of the Global War on Terror. To keep these aircraft flying until the replacement Multi-Mission Aircraft (P-8A Poseidon) is fielded, $313,900,000 is provided for the procurement and installation of wing repair kits.</narrative>
  <narrative>Marine Corps aircraft deployed in theater should have a capable self defense system. Some of the deployed Marine Corps aircraft have less than capable or outdated defensive systems. To improve the capability of deployed Marine Corps aircraft, $15,000,000 is provided for the procurement of defensive weapons for V-22 aircraft and $3,500,000 is provided for the procurement of defensive weapons for CH-46 aircraft.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation provides funds identified by the Marine Corps associated with growing the size of its force, to include $26,400,000 for lightweight 155mm howitzers, $12,000,000 for weapons, $43,000,000 for trailers and $144,000,000 for armored vehicle sets.</narrative>
  <narrative>The fiscal year 2008 supplemental request included $640,000,000 for G-BOSS, a capability that will provide updated base security for the Marine Corps. Public Law 110-161 provided $340,000,000 of that total program requirement. Briefings with the Marine Corps and the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization [JIEDDO] indicate that JIEDDO will fund the remaining G-BOSS requirement of $300,000,000.</narrative>
  <narrative>In light of increases to both the Army and Marine Corps end-strength and the emerging lift needs of the Future Combat System, the Department of Defense has not adequately assessed strategic lift requirements. The need for an accurate assessment is critical because the C-17 aircraft production line is facing shut-down in the very near-term. As a prudent course of action to avoid plant shutdown before the requirement is fully assessed, the recommendation provides $3,604,500,000 to procure 15 C-17  aircraft.</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $2,469,700,000 is recommended for the procurement of 34 C/KC/MC-130J aircraft. Given the age and usage of the C-130, KC-130 and MC-130 fleets, it is justifiable to acquire replacement aircraft faster and in higher quantities in order to drive down unit acquisition costs and operating costs. Therefore, the recommendation fully funds 18 C-130J aircraft, seven MC-130J aircraft and nine KC-130J aircraft. These funds are provided with the expectation that the Department of Defense  will proceed expeditiously with negotiations to enter into a follow-on joint multi-year procurement contract in order to lock in lower acquisition prices. It is anticipated that the savings achieved with a multi-year procurement contract will be applied to the associated economic order quantity requirement.</narrative>
  <narrative>The fiscal year 2007 supplemental provided $112,400,000 to install LAIRCM on C-37 aircraft at an estimated cost of $11,200,000 per aircraft. Due to discounts offered by the vendor and installer for subsequent aircraft, each additional aircraft modification was approximately 50 percent of the original estimate, resulting in a savings of $55,000,000. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to use the savings to fund the LAIRCM modification for C-20B and C-20H aircraft. These aircraft are not  currently tasked for missions into areas where man-portable, shoulder-fired, infrared seeking anti-aircraft missile countermeasures are required. Passengers are transferred to combat aircraft such as the C-130 and C-17 that are equipped with countermeasure equipment.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes no funding for the Air Force to replace its handgun. $5,000,000 was provided in fiscal year 2007 to perform a study on replacing the handgun that was not executed because there was no validated requirement for a new handgun. This remains an unsubstantiated need for fiscal year 2008 supplemental funds and the Air Force is urged to request funds in the baseline account if it intends to pursue this program in the future.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation for the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account is $825,000,000. Of this amount, $675,000,000 is for the Army National Guard and $150,000,000 is for the U.S. Army Reserve to meet urgent equipment needs that may arise this fiscal year. This funding will allow the Army Guard and Army Reserve to procure high priority items such as: AH-64 helicopter modifications from A model to D model for the Army Guard; HH-60 Blackhawk medical evacuation helicopters for the Army Reserve;  UH-60 helicopter model A to L conversions; HMMWV utility vehicles; Heavy Expanded Mobile Tactical Trucks; Liquid Logistics Storage and Distribution Systems; sniper detection devices; MILSATCOM, NAVSTAR GPS, and other communications equipment; Night Vision equipment; psychological operations equipment; Water Purification Systems; Air</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $1,745,483,000 is recommended for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendations for each research, development, test and evaluation account are shown below:</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $185,499,000 is recommended for the JOINT STARS aircraft program. $58,600,000 is for the Primary Mission Equipment and Diminishing Manufacturing Source [PME/DMS] development program, $1,409,000 is for the Surface Warfare Joint Capability Technology Demonstration, $36,000,000 is for increased bandwidth and beyond line of site capability for the aircraft, $4,100,000 is for Single Channel Ground to Air  Radio System [SINCGARS] voice initial  capability insertion, and $85,390,000 is for the Radar Technology Insertion Program for Joint STARS.</narrative>
  <narrative>Beginning in fiscal year 2012 the current C-17 Heads-Up Display [HUD] will no longer be supportable due to problems associated with parts obsolescence. Given this timeline, the Air Force may use C-17 research, development, test and evaluation funds already appropriated in fiscal year 2008 to start a replacement program for the HUD.</narrative>
  <narrative>Defense Working Capital Funds</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $1,837,450,000 is recommended for the Defense Working Capital Funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendations for each Defense Working Capital Fund account are shown below:</narrative>
  <narrative>National Defense Sealift Fund</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $5,110,000 is recommended for the National Defense Sealift Fund.</narrative>
  <narrative>Defense Health Program</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $1,488,864,000 is recommended for the Defense Health Program.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendations for operation and maintenance, procurement and research, development, test and evaluation are shown below:</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes an additional $293,023,000 for sustainment, restoration and modernization of military medical projects for the Army, Navy and Air Force. The average "recapitalization rate" (aggregate investment in infrastructure) for civilian hospitals is 21 years and the current Department of Defense medical facility recapitalization rate exceeds 75 years. This funding is only a temporary band-aid for certain facilities and the Department is urged to request the necessary military  construction funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes $5,000,000 in the Information Management budget activity group within operation and maintenance and $25,000,000 in procurement for the advancement of real time interoperability of medical images and data. This project enables real-time interoperability for the Theater Medical Information Program [TMIP] and other Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and civilian medical systems to provide life saving capabilities to our service men and women. TMIP  applications are currently deployed all the way down to our field medics to record patient encounter data, usually at the point of injury. Department of Defense medical application data is not currently in a common data format; Veterans Affairs data is entered as text, preventing the data from being computable. Integration and processing of data is not done in real-time; utilizing data in this manner</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes an additional $62,000,000 for unfunded procurement requirements for the Army and Navy. The Air Force does not have any unfunded procurement requirements for fiscal year 2008. Providing the most advanced medical equipment is essential for the care of our service members and their families and the Services have a limited ability to procure critical medical technology because of the exponential cost growth for medical equipment and the restrictions on the service medical  accounts. Additional procurement resources have been provided to the Services for the past 2 years and the Department must make a concerted effort to reflect these requirements in future budget submissions for the Defense Health Program.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes an additional $273,800,000 to address prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and mitigation of deployment-related injuries and psychological health concerns. These funds are targeted to accelerate ongoing programs and are for peer reviewed research into emergent approaches and technologies. These funds are directed toward the following research areas: final development of medical devices for use in theater (including portable suction machines and EKGs for theater hospitals);  blood safety and blood products; burns (including tissue viability and fluid resuscitation); orthopedic and other trauma treatment and rehabilitation (including face, visual/ocular and nerve damage, dental, and auditory systems); suicide prevention and counseling (including reducing nurse stress and fatigue at military treatment facilities); traumatic brain injury and psychological health (including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder); injury prevention; wound infection</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommendation includes an additional $70,000,000 to increase investigators and research capabilities in Traumatic Brain Injury and regenerative medicine across the Armed Forces. The focus of this initiative is an intramural start-up for the study of blast injury to the brain and post traumatic stress by studying actual combat casualties cared for at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the National Naval Medical Center and using sophisticated neuroimaging technology at the National Institute  of Health's Clinical Center.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition to amounts otherwise available to the Defense Health Program, $75,000,000 is available to continue work for traumatic brain injury and psychological health.</narrative>
  <narrative>Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $65,317,000 is recommended for Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense for operations in Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Thailand and Turkmenistan.</narrative>
  <narrative>Office of the Inspector General</narrative>
  <narrative>An appropriation of $6,394,000 is recommended for the Office of the Inspector General. This is an increase of $2,000,000 in research, development, test and evaluation funding for the development of an Investigative Data System for the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.</narrative>
  <narrative>The recommended bill includes the following general provisions for this chapter:</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 11101 establishes the period of availability for obligation for appropriations provided in this chapter.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 11102 provides that funds made available in this chapter are in addition to amounts provided elsewhere for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2008.</narrative>

  <narrative>Section 11104 provides that of the funds made available for the Department of Defense, $1,226,841,000 may be used to execute programs under the Commander's Emergency Response Program for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Philippines.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 11105 provides for transfer of funds to the Defense Cooperation Account to appropriations or funds as determined by the Secretary of Defense.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 11106 provides that not to exceed $20,000,000 of funds made available under "Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense" may be used to support counter-drug activities of certain governments, and that such support is in addition to support provided under any other provision of law.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 11107 provides for up to 20 heavy and light armored vehicles for force protection purposes in Iraq and Afghanistan and up to 21 vehicles from funds previously appropriated.</narrative>
  <narrative>Section 11108 provides for the transfer of funds to the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund.</narrative>

  <narrative>Recommendation</narrative>
  <narrative>In title XI, chapter 3, the following is recommended.</narrative>
  <narrative>The United States and the Government of Iraq are increasing their reliance on U.S. funds for reconstruction efforts in Iraq, and the Department of Defense is financing a large number of long-term and costly projects. Many of these efforts are urgently needed, but the Government of Iraq should bear the majority of these costs. Therefore, the Secretary of Defense is directed to immediately begin to develop the processes and procedures necessary to institute an equal cost sharing between the United  States and Iraq for all reconstruction projects funded in this title greater than $750,000. Implementation of this new cost sharing arrangement shall begin no later than October 1, 2008. This is the necessary first step in decreasing the Government of Iraq's heavy reliance on U.S. funding for reconstruction efforts.</narrative>

ADMISSION OF TEMPORARY H-2A WORKERS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(a) Conditions for Approval of H-2A Petitions.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(1) A petition to import an alien as an H-2A worker (as defined in subsection (i)(2)) may not be approved by the Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary of Labor for a certification that-- &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the petition, and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(B) the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(2) The Secretary of Labor may require by regulation, as a condition of issuing the certification, the payment of a fee to recover the reasonable costs of processing applications for certification. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(b) CONDITIONS FOR DENIAL OF LABOR CERTIFICATION.--The Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under subsection (a) with respect to an employer if the conditions described in that subsection are not met or if any of the following conditions are met: &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute which, under the regulations, precludes such certification. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period employed H-2A workers and the Secretary of Labor has determined, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the employer at any time during that period substantially violated a material term or condition of the labor certification with respect to the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(B) No employer may be denied certification under subparagraph (A) for more than three years for any violation described in such subparagraph. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [(3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that if the employment for which the certification is sought is not covered by State workers' compensation law, the employer will provide, at no cost to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment which will provide benefits at least equal to those provided under the State workers' compensation law for comparable employment.</narrative>
