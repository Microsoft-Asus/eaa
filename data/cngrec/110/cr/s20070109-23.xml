  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="CORPORAL MATTHEW JOSEPH STANLEY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. Army CPL Matthew Joseph Stanley of Wolfeboro, NH. Tragically, on December 16, 2006, this courageous young soldier and two of his comrades gave their last full measure for our Nation when their Army vehicle struck an improvised explosive device in Taji, Iraq, north of Baghdad. At the time of this hostile action Corporal Stanley, a cavalry scout with C Troop, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, based in  Fort Hood, TX, was serving his second tour in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Matthew was a 2002 graduate of Kingswood Regional High School where he was wellknown and liked by his teachers and fellow students. Classmates remember Matthew as fun, always laughing and having a smile on his face. Family and friends say he was one of the nicest guys you would ever want to meet and remember his fondness for hunting and fishing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sensing a call to duty, and because of his desire to protect his country, in December 2003, Matthew joined the U.S. Army. Upon completing basic training at Fort Knox, KY, in the spring of 2004, he reported to Fort Hood, TX. The awards and decorations that Corporal Stanley received over the succeeding months are a testament to the strong character of this man. They include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, two Army Commendation Medals, Army Good Conduct Medal, Combat Action Badge, National  Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and Expert Rifle Qualification Badge. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of corporal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patriots from the state of New Hampshire have served our Nation with honor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Taji--and U.S. Army CPL Matthew Stanley served and fought in that same fine tradition. During our country's difficult Revolutionary War, Thomas Paine wrote "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman." In  these turbulent times Matthew stood with the country he loved, served it with distinction and honor, and earned and deserves our love and thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Matthew's wife Amy, his parents Lynn and Richard, his brothers and sisters, and to his other family members and many friends who have suffered this most grievous loss. All will sorely miss Matthew Stanley, a 22-year-old patriot who was proud of his family, proud of where he lived, and proud of what he did. In the words of Daniel Webster--may his remembrance  be as long lasting as the land he honored. God  bless Matthew Joseph Stanley.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="CORPORAL JONATHAN E. SCHILLER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with a sense of sadness, but also pride, that I rise today to pay tribute to CPL. Jonathan E. Schiller of Ottumwa, IA, who gave his life on New Year's Eve in service to his country in Iraa. He is remembered by friends and family for his good humor and his patriotism. Corporal Schiller's parents, Bill and Liz Schiller, said of their son, "Jon died doing what he loved, serving his country and protecting the freedom of our people and others. We are proud of our  son's accomplishments and those of his fellow soldiers in the Army and all branches of the military. We are forever grateful to the Army for changing our boy into a man who fought and died defending something that we take for granted every day... freedom!" My thoughts and prayers are with Bill and Liz, Jon's brothers Charlie and Max, and all of those in the Ottumwa area and elsewhere</paragraph>
