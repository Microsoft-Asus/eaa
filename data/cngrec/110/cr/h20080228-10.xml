  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Bruce Beyer, a remarkable constituent of mine from Davenport, Iowa, who was recently awarded the Army's Outstanding Individual with Disability Award. I'm proud that Bruce was one of 16 employees honored at the DOD Disability Awards ceremony in December for his contributions to the Army Sustainment Command at Rock Island Arsenal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bruce has been in a wheelchair since a bicycle accident in 1982 left him a quadriplegic without the use of his arms. According to his boss, Bruce Angus, who nominated him, Bruce is an inspiration to everyone around him and exemplifies the tenet that the only true disability in life is a bad attitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bruce is active in raising awareness about people with disabilities by training managers through the arsenal's Windmill Program, by serving as a counselor in the Rock Island-Milan School District, and by conducting seminars in assistive technology and advocacy for disabled individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bruce is a model of perseverance and a source of pride for the First District of Iowa, and I join his family, friends, colleagues and community in congratulating him on receiving this honor, and I'm thanking and commending him for his incredible contributions to the arsenal and the Quad Cities community.</paragraph>
