  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO COBB COUNTY, GEORGIA PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL -- (Senate - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11653">S11653</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on October 1, 2007, the Cobb Chamber of Commerce will hold its Public Safety Recognition Awards breakfast, and I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for all public safety personnel in my home county of Cobb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our public safety officers and personnel make the difference in ensuring that we are able to go about our daily routines, get a good night's sleep, and enjoy the many freedoms we have in our country today because we don't have to constantly fear for our well-being. For this, I believe I am representing not only my Cobb County constituents, but all Georgians when I say thank you to all of our public safety personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether they are the dispatcher answering the telephone, an officer on the street, an undercover agent living in dirty and dangerous conditions to obtain needed information or an assistant at a desk, they all work as a team to keep me safe, my family safe, and Cobb County safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the daily requirements of basic safety, they go above and beyond by helping to educate our citizens and young people through special programs in schools, such as Partners in Education, and throughout the community to help fight crime and keep folks off drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we recently observed the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on our Nation, we are reminded of the great lengths our public safety personnel and first responders go to in order to keep us safe. Cobb County's public safety personnel--our police, firefighters and emergency medical professionals--have answered the extraordinary call to serve their county and risk their lives to keep our community safe. They are America's first line of defense, and they are our true American heroes.</paragraph>
