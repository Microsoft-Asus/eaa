    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators and those at their desks, right now we are going to try to get back on the farm bill. As you know, an agreement was reached last night between the majority leader and the Republican leader on the process we will be following, so I am going to  propound a unanimous consent request. I hope this has been cleared on both sides. That will basically bring us back to the farm bill. In other words, it  will take down the so-called tree that was filled and take down all amendments that are pending, and the bill, as a substitute, will be pending, but then it is open for amendments at that point, for any amendment that has already been filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the agreement was reached last night, there will be 20 amendments on each side. I am telling Senators if they have an amendment to the farm bill, they probably ought to get over here and offer an amendment. Senator Chambliss and I are going to try to work together to try to make an even flow of this, to get the amendments up and reach time agreements and things like that so we can move the farm bill as expeditiously as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that the House message on <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill> be returned to the Secretary's desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
