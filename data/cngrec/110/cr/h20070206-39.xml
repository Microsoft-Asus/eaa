  <speaking speaker="400290" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="482">H.R. 482</bill>) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to transfer ownership of the American River Pump Station Project, and for other purposes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="482">H.R. 482</bill> directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain lands and the water pumping facility under construction on the American River to the Placer County Water Agency in California. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation is obligated by a previous agreement to supply temporary pumping service to satisfy the water rights of the Placer County Water Agency. This temporary pumping is done at considerable cost to the Bureau of Reclamation. The American River Pump Station will  provide a permanent facility for the delivery of water to that agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="482">H.R. 482</bill> allows the bureau to satisfy its contractual obligations by transferring this facility and eliminates the continued cost of providing temporary pumping service to that agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 109th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water and Power held a hearing on similar legislation, and the bill was subsequently favorably reported by the committee and passed by the House. We have no objections to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="482">H.R. 482</bill>, and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="482">H.R. 482</bill>, introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Doolittle), directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer ownership of the American River Pump Station Project to the Placer County Water Agency in Northern California. To facilitate construction of the Auburn Dam nearly 40 years ago, the Federal Government removed a locally owned pump station located at the dam site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dam was never built. Now the Federal Government is building a permanent pump station to replace the  one it removed years earlier. Under an agreement, the Federal Government must transfer the pump station to the local water users once construction is complete. Before the transfer can take place, congressional authorization is needed, and this legislation achieves that purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Doolittle), the author of the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rahall, and the ranking member, Mr. Young, and also thank Mrs. Napolitano and Mrs. McMorris Rodgers for their help on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been quite a few years in production. The pump station is almost complete. It will be completed next year sometime, we anticipate; and we would like to have this last detail of the transfer put in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have heard the explanation as to why we need the legislation, fulfilling an obligation made by the Federal Government years ago to the Placer County Water Agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very appreciative to our colleagues for bringing this bill up and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today in support of <bill type="h" number="482">H.R. 482</bill>, the American River Pump Station Project Transfer Act. This legislation will authorize the transfer of ownership of the American River Pump Station, located in Auburn, CA, to the Placer County Water Agency (Agency). I would like to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Committee for bringing this legislation to the floor in such a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 1960s, the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) acquired the site of the original American River Pump Station and removed it to facilitate contraction of the Auburn Dam. When construction of the dam was halted, the Agency was left unable to meet its water needs. Since 1990, the Bureau has installed seasonal pumps to help the Agency provide water during the dry summer. Unfortunately, these pumps need to be removed each winter and reinstalled in time for the summer months. This is an expensive  process that leaves the Agency without the long-term water-use certainty it needs. To remedy this situation, a new American River Pump Station will be constructed by the Bureau, and this legislation is needed to authorize the transfer of that station to the local agency for future operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by the Bureau, the Agency and the local elected officials, and I appreciate all their hard work in this endeavor. I would specifically like to thank the members of the Placer County Water Agency: Current Board Chairman Lowell Jarvis; board members Alex Ferreira, Otis Wollen, and Mike Lee; and new board member Grey Allen have all worked to enable the Agency to meet the water-use needs of the community it serves. I also want to recognize former board member Pauline  Roccucci who spoke with me many times on this issue. I want to thank General Manager Dave Breninger, who has been and remains a tireless and passionate advocate of the permanent pump station and Strategic Affairs Director Einar Maisch who offered strong testimony in support of this bill and helped us to get here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the completion of the pump station will provide regional benefits to so many in Western Placer County, I want to thank the City Councils in Rocklin and Lincoln and our County Board of Supervisors for their steadfast support of this critical project. I would also be remiss for not recognizing the commitment and dedication of two local U.S. Bureau of Reclamation staff: Regional Director Kirk Rodgers and Central Area Office Manager Mike Finnegan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This entire group made up the team which worked for years in advancing the permanent American River Pump Station to get us to the point we are at today, and it is with them in mind that I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="482">H.R. 482</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers. Hopefully, we will be able to continue working in a bipartisan manner to get these very, very critical projects going and approved and moving out of this House. I am sure that we are going to have others that are just equally important. I hope the same consideration is given to all those.</paragraph>
