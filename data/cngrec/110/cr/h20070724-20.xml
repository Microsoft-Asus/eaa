  <narrative>DEMOCRATS' EFFORT TO INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE IS PART OF BROADER ECONOMIC AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8299]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today marks the first time in a decade that those hardworking workers who earn minimum wage will receive a pay raise. Today, around the Nation, workers who have been paid $5.15 for 10 years will finally get a boost in their pay. This wage increase will directly benefit low-income workers who need it most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should never forget that most minimum wage workers are adults who work to support themselves and their families, and many are single mothers who must work several jobs to make ends meet. And while some at the very top are primarily benefiting from the supposed economic recovery, most workers have seen very little economic progress. Average real wages are lower today than they were in 2001, even though productivity is up by 13 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this wage increase is a great concrete step by the new Democratic-led Congress toward a broader agenda that will help us not only grow our economy, but ensure that every American benefits from that growth.</paragraph>
