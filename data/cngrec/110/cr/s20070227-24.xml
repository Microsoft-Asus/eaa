    <paragraph>Mr. President, March is National Eye Donor Month, an opportunity to celebrate the gift of sight, to honor past donors and their families, and to raise public awareness regarding the importance of eye donation. We in the Senate can help ensure a sufficient supply of precious corneas by educating the public about the importance of eye donation and encouraging more Americans to become organ donors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, more than 46,000 Americans had their lives renewed and reinvigorated through the miracle of corneal transplantation. This surgical procedure gives those people who have lost, or are losing, their vision the life-changing gift of restored sight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 30 years, Teresa Walton, an Ohio resident, lived without depth perception and with the stigma of an altered appearance, because a viral infection stole the vision in her left eye. At the age of 15, while most other children were enjoying high school sports and anxiously awaiting the day they could earn their driver's license, Teresa was unable to recognize when someone approached her from the left, nor could she easily navigate a set of stairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in her forties, Teresa decided it was time for a transplant. Because of the transplant she received in Springfield, OH, the vision in Teresa's left eye was restored. With the return of her depth perception, Teresa can now easily light the candles on her three daughters' birthday cakes. She is no longer self-conscious about the appearance of her left eye. And as a teacher, she can now recognize when one of her students is standing next to her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the tireless efforts of the eye banks located throughout the country, and the coordinated efforts of the Eye Bank Association of America, Teresa Walton and thousands upon thousands of Americans like her have rediscovered the many joys full vision affords.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The power of cornea transplantation is evident in Teresa's story, but it is  only possible if concerned Americans register as an organ donor and, subsequently, inform their family members and loved ones of their intention to donate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why, as National Eye Donation Month approaches, I encourage my colleagues to work with their local eye banks, and the Eye Bank Association of America, to promote eye donation and provide more people, like Teresa Walton, with the miracle cornea transplantation provides. There is no gift more meaningful, or more profoundly important, than the gift of sight.</paragraph>
