  <speaking speaker="400642" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor Glenn H. Curtiss from my hometown of Hammondsport, New York. Glenn Curtiss was a true transportation pioneer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, I introduced House Resolution 84 to recognize Glenn Curtiss for setting the world's speed record on the first V-8 powered motorcycle exactly 100 years ago today. In honor of that ride in 1907, the Curtiss Museum and the City of Ormond Beach, Florida, which is the "birthplace of speed," hosted a Curtiss motorcycle run on the beach today, January 24, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his recordbreaking speed, which was 137 miles an hour, Mr. Curtiss was the founder of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, now part of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. Glenn Curtiss also developed the first successful sea plane and manufactured the famous World War I Jenny training plane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to honor the memory of Mr. Glenn Curtiss, and I encourage all Members to join me in honoring the legacy of Mr. Curtiss and cosponsoring House Resolution 84.</paragraph>
