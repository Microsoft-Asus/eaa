    <paragraph>Mr. President it is both with deep gratitude and regret that I announce the retirement of my Academies Coordinator, Teresa Poole, from the public sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teresa Poole, a distinguished U.S. Senate staffer, is set to retire from the political arena on January 31, 2007. This year has been a milestone, marking her thirtieth year of hard work and dedication to the Federal Government, the citizens of southwest Missouri, and most importantly the U.S. Senate offices of Danforth, Ashcroft, and BOND. We have come together to honor and congratulate Teresa on her devotion, team spirit, and the proficient skills she has provided the Springfield office  over the past 30 years. Teresa is to be envied and admired by all in government for her service to the public, which she has done with a helpful heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January 1977, Teresa Poole was member of the first U.S. Senate constituent service office in southwest Missouri for Senator Danforth. Little would Teresa know this would begin a remarkable 30-year trek with the U.S. Senate. With her incredible knowledge of the inner workings of government and her history with the U.S. Senate, Teresa has been a great source of information. She took pride in being able to guide effectively constituents, organizations, and coworkers through the complex infrastructure  of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the numerous achievements that Teresa has attained over the years, her most remarkable was her enthusiastic commitment to the Military Academies. She has worked tirelessly to help students from across Missouri to achieve their dreams of becoming officers in the U.S. military by guiding them through the process required to gain a congressional nomination. Teresa has sifted through thousands of letters, applications, and grades, and made endless calls to hopeful applicants. All of this would  be finally completed in December, only to start over the next year with new names, faces, and challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teresa Poole has shown unwavering loyalty and dedication to her job over the past 30 years. From the day to day routine of compiling local clips to answering the phone, Teresa has approached every task with hard work and a positive attitude. She has delighted everyone she meets with her love of antiques and finding good deals at various auctions and sales, her love of travel with her mother and daughter, her passion for her family and heritage, and her impeccable spirit. We commend her for a  stunning and distinguished career with the U.S. Senate and wish Teresa the best in all her future endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Teresa, we have been honored to work with you for so many years. We will miss you and we wish you and your family the very best.</paragraph>
