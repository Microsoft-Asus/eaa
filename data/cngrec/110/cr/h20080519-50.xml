  <speaking speaker="412235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm here tonight to speak a little bit about energy process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, some folks here in the Congress seem to think that we can tax our pick-up trucks and our cars from empty to full. Just recently, a congressman proposed a 50-cent tax increase on gasoline. You heard me correct, an extra 50 cents added to each gallon. Someone actually proposed that here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say that 99 percent of my constituents don't want another 50 cents in taxes added to their gasoline prices. That 50-cent tax increase would put gas at around $4.12 cents per gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you would like to effectively cripple the families and small businesses across the United States and back in my First District of Tennessee, a 50-cent tax increase would do just that. Madam Speaker, that just doesn't make any sense to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we need is some east Tennessee commonsense, along with another lesson from the 8th grade civics class and economic classes. When demand is high, supply is low, then energy prices will be outrageous. That's exactly what we see today. How do you bring down energy prices?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighth grade economics: create a bigger supply. How do you create a bigger supply of energy? No more excuses. First, we need to stop making excuses. We need an energy policy that allows us to use American energy. We need to drill for oil in ANWR and off the Outer Continental Shelf. We need to use fuel sources in Colorado and North Dakota, just to name a few. We need to use our abundant coal supply through the use of clean coal technology. We need to create safe nuclear power plants and we need  to build new refineries. No more excuses. And we need to expand our green energy initiatives like switchgrass, wind power, solar power and hydroelectric power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need an energy piece; we need an energy policy. You can't take one part of an energy policy and call it a policy. I'm all for green energy, but green energy will only get you to about 6 percent of our energy needs in America. That only leaves 94 percent. We need an energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, there is a limited supply of oil being imported into the United States by countries who hate us and hate our freedoms. We're at the mercy of these countries. My family, your family, small businesses across America and the families in the First District of Tennessee are all at the mercy of countries who hate us and hate our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A sound energy policy that explores new green initiatives, while investing in American energy sources, is what we need and we need it now. Not another tax increase, not another regulation, not another restriction that some people believe would help fill up our pick-up trucks and our automobiles. We need a common-sense energy policy. No more excuses.</paragraph>
