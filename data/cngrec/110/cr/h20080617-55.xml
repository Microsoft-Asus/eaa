  <narrative>AIR FORCE TANKER DECISION -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5459]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Air Force tanker decision and its impact on our economy and jobs, especially during these hard economic times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, an independent report predicted that 14,000 jobs would be lost if the multibillion dollar Air Force tanker contract was awarded to a foreign company. And the report states, "These figures understate the potential losses to U.S. employment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's outrageous that the Air Force officials did not take into consideration the economic impact of this decision. By outsourcing the production of the tanker, we are denying hardworking Americans good, high-paying jobs, and turning a blind eye to our deteriorating economic situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this tanker deal further jeopardizes the economic security of our Nation. At a time when America is facing a record-high level of unemployment recession, creating jobs in Europe is not in the best interests of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Congress must address the broader economic concerns raised by the tanker decision. We owe it to the American people to take advantage of the opportunity to create jobs right here in the United States and resuscitate our failing economy.</paragraph>
