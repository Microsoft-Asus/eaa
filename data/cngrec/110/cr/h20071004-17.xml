    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last April, Charlotte police officers Sean Clark and Jeff Shelton were shot and killed in the line of duty as they responded to a call at an east Charlotte apartment complex. As a result of these tragic murders came the Blue Ribbon Campaign. Many miles of free blue ribbon were distributed throughout the greater Charlotte area. Jeff Katz, a former police officer who hosts the afternoon drive show on WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina, urged listeners to display the blue ribbons  on cars and homes as well as on their persons to visibly support law enforcement. On his radio show, Katz asked listeners to donate to a special memorial fund for the families of the slain officers. In a matter of hours, Katz had pledges of $50,000. Those making pledges were directed to make their donations directly to the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 9.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend these officers and their families for their sacrifice and thank their brothers and sisters in law enforcement for their commitment to keep the city safe. I also want to thank Jeff Katz and countless citizens for their tremendous efforts in the Blue Ribbon Campaign responding to this tragedy. Out of this tragedy it was encouraging to see the tremendous outpouring of support from the whole community for our law enforcement personnel who risk their lives every day for all of us.</paragraph>
