    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the appropriation bill before us today. This legislation addresses the violent crime problem head on by investing $100 million into the COPS program to put more cops on the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need additional cops now more than ever. For example, in my hometown of Orlando, Florida, we experienced a 123 percent increase in the murder rate last year. Yesterday I received a letter from a 7-year-old boy in Orlando. He writes, "My name is Santiago Valera. I am a 7-year-old boy. I live with my grandma. We live in Orlando, Florida. Every day bad people rob and kill good people. They even shot my Auntie Connie in her neck. I'm afraid to go outside and play. I don't want someone to kill  my little brother or me or my grandma. Please help us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Santiago and all the other little boys and girls of central Florida, please know that we hear your concerns, and help is on the way.</paragraph>
