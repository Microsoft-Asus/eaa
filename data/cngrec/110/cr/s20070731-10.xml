  <narrative>INFORMED CONSENT -- (Senate - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10340">S10340</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I talk about the topic that brings me to the floor, I express my gratitude to the majority leader, Senator Reid, for bringing up the freedom of information reform bill that Senator Leahy, the Senator from Vermont, and I have been working on for a number of years. When I was attorney general of Texas, it was my responsibility to enforce our open Government laws, and I became a big advocate of greater transparency, more openness in Government,  because I believe that only a public that is truly informed can give their consent. It has to be informed consent. That is, after all, the very fundamental basis for the legitimacy of all of our laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I came to the Senate, I was pleased to see that Senator Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had been very active in this area. We joined efforts in a bipartisan way to work on these reforms. I know Senator Kyl has some concerns. He expressed those this morning. He has been good about working with us to try to work our way through that. I share his hope and aspiration that we can work through the differences and perhaps complete our work on those Freedom of  Information Act reforms this week before we break for August. I think that would be a very positive development and one that is certainly worthy of the Senate.</paragraph>
