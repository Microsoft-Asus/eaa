    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the contribution of the Roman Catholic school system in the United States. From January 28 through February 2 of this year, communities across our Nation celebrated National Catholic Schools Week. This year's theme of "Catholic Schools: the Good News in Education" emphasizes the balanced and diverse educational perspective offered by Catholic education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With more than 8,000 elementary and secondary schools across our Nation, Catholic education is an important part of educational communities across our country. My home State of Nevada is no exception. We have more than 16 Catholic schools that serve over 5,000  students. These schools play an important role in their communities, teaching service and character to their students in the Catholic tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This tradition is what encourages many parents to sacrifice to pay for a Catholic education. As many students, parents, and teachers will tell you, a Catholic education provides balance to students not only in their educational experience, but also in their spiritual life. The values taught in Catholic schools are important for developing engaged and informed members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Catholic education has played a needed role in our educational system for more than a century. I am confident that Nevada and our Nation will be well served by Catholic schools for many years to come.</paragraph>
