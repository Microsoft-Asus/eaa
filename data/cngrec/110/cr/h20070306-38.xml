    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are here today to pass the Charlie W. Norwood Living Kidney Organ Donation Clarification Act. We do so both to honor Dr. Norwood, who provided such great service to his district and to the country for many years; of course, Dr. Norwood did so as the result of being a recipient of lung transplants himself; but also to honor the thousands of Americans who are today waiting for kidney transplants. This bill, we believe, will be a great step forward to hasten the day when those folks  can potentially have kidney transplants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fitting tribute to Dr. Norwood for his tireless efforts to improve our Nation's health and his great work in fighting as a patient's advocate. I will submit for the record a statement from Dr. Norwood in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I would like to thank the staff of both of the committees, as well as Dr. Norwood's office and personal staff, for their work to make this bill a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would allow a procedure commonly known as paired donation to be legal, to make that clear, and to provide hope to patients waiting for kidney transplants. Paired organ donation will make it possible for thousands of people who wish to donate a kidney to a spouse, a family member or a friend but find that they are medically incompatible to still become living kidney donors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is very important, because, as of February 23, we had over 70,000 patients who are now on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, and yet we performed only 16,500 kidney transplants in 2005, of which only 6,500 were living kidney donors. <bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill> will take a significant step towards reducing the number of patients on the waiting list and giving many more the hope that their wait will not be endless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, this bill is supported by numerous medical organizations, including the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the American Society of Transplantation, the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have sort of a local person who gives me advise about this, Dr. Connie Davis, who is a transplant expert, a physician, and she says that this bill is a huge step forward for the transplant community as clinical efforts in the direction of paired donation have been severely hampered by concerns over the legal status of such activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is imperative that we make it clear that there is no intent by Congress to bar this procedure. It is my hope that the Senate will act quickly on this. Simply put, we want this legislation to save lives immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, for the 70,000 patients waiting for lifesaving kidney transplants, with time spent on costly and often arduous  dialysis treatment, their time on the waiting list can be significantly shortened with passage and implementation of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor to stand here working for the name of Dr. Charlie Norwood. I want to thank all those who have worked on this bill, and I hope very shortly we can have this on the President's desk and help those 70,000 people to a healthy future and great productive years, just like Dr. Norwood had in the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statement of the Honorable Charlie Norwood</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill>, the Living Kidney Organ Donation Clarification Act. This bill will explicitly state that Americans in need of a kidney will have a greater chance of receiving one through the process of paired donation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 70,000 Americans are currently in need of a kidney transplant. As a result of significant demand and limited supply, most transplantees wait for over four years before receiving a kidney. Four years for their lives to be saved or lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this time, if their kidneys fail, End Stage Renal Disease can set in. These patients must undergo dialysis. While dialysis extends patients' lives, their condition often prevents them from being fully engaged in their community and career. Dialysis is life-extending, but not life-bettering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, in many cases, this is where patients lose their battle. In 2004 alone, 3,823 transplant candidates died awaiting a kidney. As our population ages, that figure is going to increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, medical science has enabled us to perform more successful organ transplants than ever before. These transplants give patients a new lease on life. Many Members in this body or their loved ones have been touched by the lifesaving gift of organ donation, myself included.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kidney transplants from living donors tend to be highly successful, but in many cases, those who want to give a kidney to a loved one feel they cannot help because they are not biologically compatible with the patient in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill> is very simple. It clarifies that paired donation is legal under the National Organ Transplant Act. As a result, a pair consisting of a kidney transplant candidate and an incompatible living donor can be matched with another such incompatible pair to enable two transplants that otherwise would not occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember those 3,823 souls and ask yourself--could you justify not allowing a process of simply cross-matching to save their lives?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation in memory of those who have died waiting for a kidney as well as the thousands of Americans who are seeking a transplant or trying to become a living donor to save a loved ones' life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. BARTON of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman PALLONE and Ranking Member DEAL and Congressman Inslee for expediting consideration of this specific piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have pointed out earlier on the House floor after notification of Congressman Norwood's passing, he wrote me a letter the last day he was in Washington before he flew home to Georgia, and this particular piece of legislation was the primary issue in that letter. It is very, very heartwarming, and I am very grateful that the majority would move this piece of legislation as quickly as they have done. I want to thank them sincerely for doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been pointed out, this piece of legislation will be called the Charlie Norwood Living Kidney Organ Donation Clarification Act, and it is in honor of Congressman Norwood, the late Congressman from the Tenth District of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are over 78,000 Americans who need kidney transplants. The average wait is over 4 years. Paired donation can create greater access to kidney transplants. A paired donation consists of a transplant candidate and an incompatible living donor who are matched with another similar pair so as to enable two transplants that would otherwise not occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us today clarifies the ability to perform paired transplantations through the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA. This legislation clarifies that paired donations are not considered a valuable consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has received the strong support of all the major transplant organizations, including the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Society of Transplantation, the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, the National Kidney Foundation, the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology, the Cedars Sinai Health Systems, Johns Hopkins, and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a consequence of the legislation that Congressman Norwood and Congressman Inslee have crafted, we assume that at least an additional 2,000 organ transplants a year will occur. That is truly a gift of living that will keep on giving for many, many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, unfortunately, will be the last of many great pieces of legislation that Congressman Norwood helped to pass when he was a colleague of ours in this body. He was a true statesman and sincerely a warm, personal friend of mine. I will miss him greatly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I yield back, I want to tell a story about Charlie and then read something into the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Norwood always considered himself to be very prepared. He was always ready for almost any contingency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The night that we voted the Medicare Modernization Act part D prescription drug benefit on this floor will be a time that will long be remembered because it was such a close vote and it took so long to get it passed. Charlie and myself and three other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on the Republican side had been a part of a group to craft an alternative program for the part D prescription drug benefit. Some of our alternative program was in the final legislation, but not all of  it. As a consequence, Charlie was listed as a "lean no." He was in reality a "hard no," but he listed himself as a "lean no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, when the climactic vote occurred, there weren't enough yeses on the board to pass it. So I went to one of the senior leaders of the majority party, I am not going to say which one, but I went to one of the senior leaders and I said, "I think we can get Charlie Norwood to vote for this bill." They said, "No, you're not going to get Charlie to vote for the bill." I said, "I think we can, if you'll talk to him."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I went to Charlie and I said, "Would you talk?" Charlie said, "I don't want to talk to anybody. I'm going to vote against the bill."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went back and forth. I finally arranged a meeting back in the Republican cloakroom where Charlie would discuss this particular piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, he had been a no, no, no, no, no for the last 2 weeks. So when I finally got the two parties together, Norwood immediately pulled out a list from his pocket. Now, he is deceased, so whatever the statute of limitations is has expired. And this Congressman, who had been a lean no, lean no, lean no, had a list of 10 things, 10, that if the senior leadership on the Republican side would consider, he would consider voting for the bill. Ten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, that discussion didn't go too far, so he ended up voting no. But he was prepared, and he had a list of things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in that same sense of being prepared, Mr. Inslee has already put into the RECORD Congressman Norwood's statement on this bill. Isn't that amazing? I am going to read it into the Record. This is the floor statement in support of this bill by the late Congressman Charlie Norwood of the 10th District of Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also offer a sincere thank you to Ranking Member Barton, Chairman Dingell and Mr. Inslee for all of their help moving this bill. Committee staff, including Katherine Martin, John Ford and Peter Goodloe should be acknowledged for their aid as well. A special thank you to Nick Shipley with Mr. Inslee's office who worked with J.P. from my staff from day one as a tireless advocate to get this bill into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It has been said that common sense is the knack of seeing things as they are and doing things as they ought to be done. Well, let me tell you how things were being done. For years, people missed or were delayed in an opportunity to have a life-saving kidney transplant simply because a member of the executive branch couldn't grasp the  true intent of the National Organ Transplant Act's valuable consideration clause. The valuable consideration clause  was meant to outlaw the buying and selling of organs, which everyone agrees is proper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Now, there are two types of transplant donors, living and cadaveric, or deceased. As a lung transplant recipient, I benefited from the latter, but in the case of the first, a friend or a relative wanting to spare their loved ones from death or dialysis graciously offers to give up one of their kidneys. Regardless of the method, both patient and donor must be biologically compatible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In recent years doctors discovered that by using the simple database methods that we use in our everyday lives and business, a paired donation could take place with these living donors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In the process of a kidney paired donor transplant, a pair consisting of a kidney transplant candidate and an incompatible living donor is matched with another such incompatible pair to enable two transplants that otherwise would not occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Now, I'm just an old country dentist, but isn't this just common sense? I want to give to someone, but I'm not compatible, but I can give to another patient. Their willing, yet also incompatible, friend can give to my loved one. As a result, two people live; two more slots are opened on the list for even more transplants to take place. Common sense, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"However, instead of every single transplant center undertaking this commonsense approach, some folks were denied the chance to be cross-matched and, instead, their loved one suffered and even died while awaiting a transplant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"73,652. That is roughly the number, Mr. Speaker, of people waiting for a kidney transplant. I can't imagine looking at any of those people and telling them `I am sorry, some bureaucrat 10 years ago inspired fear around the simple process to save you today, so you will have to languish on the list and hope for the best.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I will tell you what: That is hogwash. Times have changed. Paired donation is saving lives today and will save even more once we get this bill done. <bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill> has the support of every major transplant organization, from the United Network for Organ Sharing, who will manage the national list, to the surgeons who will perform the transplants, to the patient advocates to the hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In fact, a study published in the Journal of Transplantation predicts a 14 percent increase in the live kidney donor transplants performed each year if paired donation were allowed. Moreover, for each patient who receives a kidney, Medicare will save $220,000 in dialysis costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In fact, Johns Hopkins just did a five-way paired donation where five people were saved instead of being put on the waiting list. Now imagine the good a national list will do. Thousands will be saved through simple common sense. Paired donation is the way things ought to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"How often can we stand in this well on this floor and know what we are doing will save the government money, improve patient quality of life and save lives? Not too often, Mr. Speaker. I can testify to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"What the bureaucracy has failed to correct, this Congress will now step up and take care of, unfortunately for all of those who have not been able to benefit, not a minute too soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I yield back the balance of my time."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the floor statement of the late Congressman Norwood on a bill that, at the time he prepared this, he wasn't sure would get to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Yet because of his tenacity and preparedness and the willingness of Mr. Dingell and Mr. Inslee and Mr. Pallone and Speaker Pelosi, the bill is on the floor. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. I do intend to ask for a rollcall vote and let us leave a living legacy of life for the late Congressman Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Barton for reading Dr. Norwood's eloquent statement into the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to note that kidney donation is not just for the recipients. It is for their families and the places they work, and even the U.S. Congress. The reason we had the benefit of Dr. Norwood's wisdom for years in the U.S. Congress was because of a lung transplant. I want to note that what we are doing today is not only helping those 70,000 people, but also their families and workplaces and the whole U.S. economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I too wish to express appreciation to the sponsor and all of those who have made it possible to bring this bill to the floor today. It is certainly altogether fitting and proper that we name this bill after the late Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does two very important things that Charlie really believed in. The first is he believed in organ transplant. As Mr. Inslee alluded, he was the recipient of a lung transplant that extended his life. He believed in organ transplants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing that it does is something that he really believed in as well, and that is overcoming bureaucratic red tape that made no common sense. And that is what this bill does. Pairing of donations for kidneys makes all of the common sense in the world. It will save lives and money. Certainly in the tradition of Charlie Norwood, it will perpetuate the importance of organ donations and do so in the memory and in the honor of a great Member of this body.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have said strongly why this is a good piece of legislation and why it should be enacted. I strongly support it, and I urge my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill>, the Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act. I am delighted that the Commerce Committee could report this good piece of legislation to the House floor, and I am pleased by the consequences of it because we will achieve more help to those in need of organ donation, something which is of great  importance to the country and to those who are in such grave and serious need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie Norwood wanted this bill very badly. It is a good bill. We are delighted that we could bring to the House floor a good bill which not only does good but which honors its author, Charlie Norwood, by carrying forward his goals, his purposes, and his intentions with regard to helping his fellow Americans. I am delighted we can do this for Charlie Norwood who was a valuable member of the committee and who will indeed be missed by his colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a longer statement which will appear in the Record which I believe sets forth some of the things already said by my colleagues. I thank my good friend, the manager of the bill on this side, and the former chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), my dear friend, for their leadership on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill>, the "Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Charlie Norwood was a dear friend and colleague of mine. Beginning in 1995, Charlie served the people of the tenth district of Georgia admirably and honorably in the House of Representatives. Sadly, Charlie lost his long battle with cancer on February 13, 2007, but he shall not be forgotten and we will pass this legislation in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill> would modify the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) to clarify that "paired" kidney donations do not violate a clause of the act regarding "valuable consideration," which outlaws the buying or selling of kidneys and other organs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A "paired" donation occurs when a donor who is willing to give a kidney to a family member or friend, but is biologically incompatible, donates to another patient, who also has an incompatible donor. By cross-matching two  or more incompatible donor-recipient pairs, more patients can receive kidneys and more donors can give them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, an estimated 6,000 individuals nationwide have offered kidneys to family members and friends, only to have the donation rejected because they are incompatible. Many providers will not perform paired donations, however, for fear of violating NOTA. If paired donations were allowed, a study published in the Journal of Transplantation by Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology predicts that there would be a 14 percent increase in the number of live kidney donor  transplants performed each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The controversy over paired organ donation began with an interpretation by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stating that paired donation MAY be in violation of NOTA's valuable consideration clause. The clause was intended to outlaw the buying or selling of transplantable human organs. This stigma against paired donation elicits concern within some areas of the transplant community, which desperately wants clear legislative guidance on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by leading organ donation and organ transplant organizations such as the National Kidney Foundation, the American Society of Transplantation, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, the Organization for Transplant Professionals, and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paired transplantation is a way to solve the dilemma faced by people who want to become living organ donors for a family member or friend, but are unable to do so because they are biologically incompatible. And one of the added benefits of this bill is that it produces savings. Since Dr. Norwood was dedicated to making sure that physicians were treated right and paid properly, we will be using this savings to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to sincerely thank Representatives Norwood and INSLEE for their leadership, dedication, and diligent work on this important legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of <bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill>, the "Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for recognizing me, and I have a longer speech that I want to submit for the Record. I think my staff must have been looking over the ranking member's shoulder when they wrote it. He has already said those nice things about our good friend, Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was touched, though, in the letter that he received and read, the phrases "hogwash" and an "old country dentist." I was sitting here thinking, I can see Charlie saying those things on this floor. That is the way he was and that is the way we remember him. He wasn't an old country dentist, let me assure you. He was a prosperous dentist in Augusta, Georgia, a population of 130,000, the home of the Masters; but that was Charlie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me join JOE BARTON, the ranking member, in thanking Chairman Dingell. I mentioned this bill to the chairman last week, and he looked at me and said, Doc, and he had a little mist of tear in his eye, he said, Don't worry about this; we are going to do this. And I knew then that the chairman and Representative Inslee and others were fully supportive of what Charlie was trying to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If he was thinking just of himself, Mr. Speaker, this bill probably would say the Living Lung Organ Donation Act, which also would be possible; but that wasn't Charlie. He was thinking about those 70,000 other people who are waiting for a kidney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie himself had to wait a long time to get that lung. Too long, we think. I don't know if it would have saved his life if he would have had an opportunity for a paired living lung donor, but he was thinking of others who were suffering, and as others have said, to bring a commonsense solution to problem solving in a bipartisan way. They described Charlie as a dog that has got ahold of a bone and won't let it go. Well, we can say to Charlie today, as part of our legacy to him, that he has  succeeded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let's support this bill as a legacy and tribute to the great Member, Charlie Norwood</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation honors a dear friend and former colleague in this body, the late Congressman Charlie Norwood. Charlie worked tirelessly as an advocate for patients across our Nation, and this bill is a fitting tribute to the tremendous impact he's made on healthcare in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in this country, there are more than 74,000 men, women and children on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. Unfortunately, if the current trend of kidney transplants continues, only about half of these candidates will ever receive a life-saving transplant. Tragically, in 2004, nearly 4,000 listed patients died while awaiting a kidney.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One way for individuals to avoid the kidney transplant waiting list all together is to find a living donor, like a friend or family member who is willing to selflessly donate a kidney to save a loved one. The limitation on this compassion is that only compatible matches can donate kidneys; if your friends and family are not a match, they can't be your donor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But those of us who knew Charlie know that he was an excellent problem solver, always turning challenges into opportunities. With the limited donor options individuals face within their community of family and friends, patient advocates and healthcare providers have pushed for living organ donors. Charlie was convinced of the unlimited potential that could be realized when the pool of living donors would be expanded beyond one's immediate family and friends. In fact, there have been success stories  of hospitals doing just this--finding pairs of living kidney donors who aren't matches for their own loved ones, but are matches for someone else's loved one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, due to conflicting interpretations of the National Organ Transplant Act, hospitals across the country are hesitant to make this type of procedure a rule--and this where the Charlie Norwood Living Kidney Organ Donation Act will create miracles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill> would clarify in statute that this type of paired living kidney donation would be allowed under Federal law. This will alleviate the concerns of hospitals and healthcare providers that want to give all kidney patients the hope that transplants represent but ambiguity in law currently prevents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker this is a win-win situation. More patients would benefit from a kidney transplant, thereby reducing the number of individuals on the waiting list. In turn, more Americans--both on the waiting list and off--will have that miraculous second chance at life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, passing this legislation will be a lasting tribute to Charlie Norwood's selfless efforts to help those in need. While we all wish our friend's lung transplant had saved his life, we can honor him by giving Americans across our Nation greater access to the potential miracle of an organ donation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the underlying legislation, and in support of the memory and legacy of its author, my friend and colleague, Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people may remember the story of Nicholas Greene, the 17-year-old boy who was killed during a family vacation in Italy. The tragic and sudden loss of this young boy was turned into a story of hope and love when his parents generously donated his organs. Out of his tragic death sprang life, as seven people received Nicholas' heart, liver, kidneys, corneas, and pancreatic cells.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is one lesson we can take from Nicholas' great gift to the world and from the strong humanitarian legacy of Charlie Norwood, it is that we must support life whenever we have that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill> specifically excludes kidney-paired donation from the National Organ Transplant Act's valuable consideration clause. The valuable consideration clause has a noble purpose, which is to keep people from buying and selling human organs. In the case of kidney-paired donation, which is held to the highest of medical ethical standards, that purpose is obstructing the ability to save lives. By supporting this bill, we can give countless people a better chance for survival.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear: paired-organ donation does not constitute the buying or selling of organs. If we believe as much, then we accept the idea that the gift of life has a monetary value. Charlie vehemently opposed this concept, and so should we.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thousands of people die each year waiting on a transplant list, praying for the right match for a kidney. Paired donation will significantly increase the number of available kidneys each year, allowing even more people to live productive, healthy lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="710">H.R. 710</bill> honors the memory of our friend Charlie Norwood, it honors the memory of Nicholas Greene and his family, and it honors all those Americans who have lost their lives while waiting on a transplant list. As such, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this critically important vehicle for giving the gift of life to others.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to make a point. I think this is a great bipartisan success, to try to improve organ donation prospects for these 70,000 Americans. But we have more work to do. This bill is not the end of our efforts. I worked for 2 years with Mike Bilirakis, a great Republican, to try to have people in hospitals work with families on transplant donation issues. We need to fund that bill, and I hope we can have a bipartisan effort to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have work to do to fund immunosuppressant drugs. Right now, we are not funding the drugs that donees need to suppress the immunological response to donation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we can continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to help these 70,000 Americans. We will remember Charlie Norwood's efforts in this regard and on future successes</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1/2  minutes to another distinguished member of the Georgia delegation, Jack Kingston from Savannah.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400221" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Barton, and I thank Dr. Burgess for letting a noncommittee member go first. I appreciate the courtesy; and I wanted to thank Mr. Inslee for his help on this bill and all of the work and leadership by both parties on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Charlie Norwood were here today, he would be sitting there and he would be embarrassed. He would be deflecting all of these sweet things that are being said about him. But if this bill was controversial and was having a tough fight, Charlie Norwood would be right in the middle of it and pushing it along and making sure it got done and standing up for the folks outside the 70,000-plus folks who are in line for an organ transplant right now. That is who he always answered to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember the Norwood-Dingell bill on the Patients' Bill of Rights, how he did not appreciate the leadership in our party's position on it, so he went out and found alternative ways to get it done. And in that case, he cobbled together a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans to push his Patients' Bill of Rights because Charlie Norwood was a fighter, and he was always a fighter for a good cause. So it is fitting and proper for him to be recognized in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of weeks ago I was at the University of Georgia, which is located in Athens, my hometown and in Charlie Norwood's district. And I met with Dr. Steve Stice. He told me he is doing a lot of work on stem cell, and he casually mentioned that the University of Georgia had cloned about 50 cattle and sheep. I could not believe they had cloned that many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as I listened to him and all of the technological breakthroughs that are happening in the world of science and medicine today, I think what lies out there in organ transplant, we have not even scratched the surface. There will be medical revolutions in the years to come because of the technology that is out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So our laws and what we are doing today is keeping the law current with the technology and with the science. That is why it is a good thing to do this. Think about Floyd Spence, our colleague from South Carolina, who had a lung transplant for 12 years, and our brave Charlie Norwood. Think about what they do; they educate the rest of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our day in office for all of us will end. Either politically or biologically or for whatever reason, but what a great thing it is to have that service time in the House be used to hold a baton high that you can pass on to the next generation and have true national impact. That is what we are doing here today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Barton for the time, and I thank Chairman Dingell for bringing this bill to the floor. This is a wonderful legacy for Charlie Norwood. Charlie was all about clarification and common sense. We miss him on the committee. Personally, he was my mentor and had seen me through many issues on the committee. But I can think of no more fitting way to close out the legacy of Charlie Norwood than with this act that brings clarification to Federal law  and allows paired donations to proceed apace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlie Norwood, from life hereafter, has reached back to this House and delivered one last dose of common sense. Thank you, Charlie.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, could I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes to tell one last Charlie Norwood story.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I close, since we have painted Charlie Norwood to be such a saint today, I have got to kind of get a little bit truer picture of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Energy Policy Act debate of 2005, there was a provision in the bill that was not controversial in the overall part of the bill, but it was very controversial in certain areas of the country. One of those areas was in Charlie's area of the southeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had been working with him all through the debate to try to get him to help me forge a compromise on this particular issue, and he agreed that the compromise was the best public policy, but it wasn't the policy that his region supported. So he was in a difficult position of agreeing with me, the chairman, on what the good public policy was, but knowing that that was not a vote that he would be supported in taking for his region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went round and round with him about how to convince him to support this particular item in the bill, and he just flat couldn't do it. But I finally got him to agree that, at the critical moment, he would not be there to vote against it. In other words, he would be absent, meeting a constituent or something, and he just couldn't be there. He and I agreed on this, and our staffs had worked it out so that when the time came to vote, Mr. Norwood would not vote "no," which would make me happy,  but he wouldn't vote "yes" either, which would have made me even happier. He just wouldn't vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, sure enough, the critical moment came, and the vote occurred. True to his word, Charlie Norwood was not around, but as soon as I gaveled the vote, he burst into the room, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, could I be recorded. I said, no, the vote has already expired. He said, what kind of hogwash is this and just raised holy cane, purely for theatrical purposes, but you know, the point had been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So his constituency felt justified in his support, and I felt justified in he didn't vote against me, and yet he had upstaged his chairman, but in some cases, that was Charlie Norwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We rise in support of this bill. It does save money. It saves $30 million or $40 million the first year and I think $400 million to $500 million over the 10-year scoring period. So we are going to work with the majority to find a way to put these savings to use so, once again, Congressman Norwood not only is doing a good thing, providing a gift to the living, but this piece of legislation, if it becomes law, will also save the taxpayers money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would strongly urge a "yes" vote on this bill</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support legislation by Congressman JACK INSLEE that will save thousands of lives by speeding the kidney donation process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By making paired kidney donation legal, this bill will facilitate the identification of kidney donors and speed the process by which donors are matched with patients. In fact, this bill could increase the number of live kidney donor transplants performed each year by 14  percent according to a study by the Journal of Transplantation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the positive effects for kidney transplant patients, speeding the donation process will also help reduce federal spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill will reduce Medicare spending for dialysis by $500 million over 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has a wide base of support from the medical community, including the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Society of Transplantation, the Kidney Fund, the Transplant Surgeons, and the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations. I am proud to add my vote of support to this list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will give much needed hope to the more than 95,000 people who are waiting for a life-saving organ donation. I commend Congressman INSLEE for introducing this important bill.</paragraph>
