  <narrative>CHARACTER ASSASSINATION -- (Senate - September 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11739">S11739</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will not speak long because I know my friend from Iowa is here to speak in morning business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say that Senators certainly have every right to offer any amendment they choose, but they don't have a right to require me to modify my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sorry they don't acknowledge the difference between somebody who has volunteered to become a public figure, a political candidate running for election, and somebody such as General Petraeus who in the performance of his duty is reporting to the Congress on the progress in a war in which 170,000 Americans are exposed to loss of life and limb right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To try to resurrect the old political battles of the past with regard to what happened in the Georgia Senate race, or what happened in the race for President of the United States, we are not going to achieve consensus here. Those were political races and those people are public figures. I don't like it when I am criticized any more than my colleagues do, including Senator Kerry or Senator Cleland. But that is an apples-and-oranges comparison to somebody who is wearing the uniform of  a U.S. soldier who is performing his duty to report to Congress on the progress of military operations in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we may head down that road. As I said, it is every right of my colleagues to offer other amendments. We will take those as they come. But I hope all of our colleagues will, as an act of solidarity and support for General Petraeus and our men and women in uniform, vote for my resolution and condemn this character assassination on the name of a good man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
