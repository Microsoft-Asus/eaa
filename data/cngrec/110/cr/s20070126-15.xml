    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Ronald S. Bowen, who has diligently served as the president of the Utah Dental Association, UDA.

    <paragraph>The UDA is committed to the public's oral health, ethics, science, and professional development. I am proud of our dental health professionals who skillfully provide quality health care to thousands of Utahns. I am also proud of Dr. Ron Bowen, who as the president of the UDA has provided outstanding leadership among his colleagues as he represented the association on a national, state, and local level. He has extensively traveled the  State meeting with  members to address their concerns and listen to their suggestions. In addition, he has a keen sense of the legislative process and has been able to use this knowledge to accomplish great things for the association.</paragraph>
