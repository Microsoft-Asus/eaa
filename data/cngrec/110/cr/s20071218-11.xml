  <narrative>CREDIT CARD COMPANY DECEPTION -- (Senate - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15819">S15819</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412243" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I first want to comment on what a pleasure it was listening to several hours of tribute to Senator Lott. I have not served with Senator Lott for very long, but at the point in time that I, hopefully, would be allowed to decide to retire from the Senate, I could only hope I have such kind things said about me in so many different ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was glad I got an opportunity to listen to 3 hours of Senators talking nicely about each other. It is an important thing to do this time of year, and I think, frankly, it is an important thing to do more often, and we do not do enough of it around here, particularly across the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to speak as in morning business for a few minutes about something that is on everybody's mind this time of year; that is, credit cards. Now, I know why it is on my mind, because my fingers are having to do the shopping because I cannot get home to Missouri, and so I am having to click, click, click on the Internet. I now know my credit card number by heart  because I have entered it so many times in the computer trying to get gifts for my  family and my children. So I am very aware of my credit card this time of year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spent some time this year in the Senate looking at the issue of credit cards, and as we all are wringing our hands and gnashing our teeth over the subprime mortgage mess, I think we all need to begin to wring our hands and gnash our teeth about some of the credit card practices in this country. We have allowed the credit card industry to play a little fast and loose with fairness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I certainly fundamentally understand that people's obligations in terms of their credit, their unsecured credit on a credit card, are primarily their responsibility and it is important that people be responsible when they enter into debt, and it does not matter what kind of debt it is, whether it is credit card debt or any other kind of debt. On the other hand, I have spent some time trying to read through the fine print on some of these credit card agreements. Frankly, I have been trained as  a lawyer, I have worked as a lawyer for most of my adult life, I have been a State legislator, I have now worked at the Federal level legislating, and I can't understand a lot of the fine print on some of these credit card statements. If I can't understand the fine print on a lot of these credit card statements, what shot does someone who has not spent as much time around the law as I have?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you look at what is going on with the unsecured credit card industry in terms of some of the fast-and-loose play with the rules, the kinds of tricks that are being played--I will give you a great example. We now know your interest rate can go up if you get near your credit limit. We now know you can call and get an authorization to charge money on your credit card, and they will let you do it even if you go over your credit limit, and then they are going to charge you every month an extra  fee because you went over your credit limit, which they said was okay for you to do. You never know this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Imagine my interest when I learned in a hearing this year that they can raise your interest rate on your credit card just by getting more credit cards. So if you are going into a department store and they say: Hey, you can get 15 percent off today if you open a credit card, you can get 10 percent off today if you open a credit card, the act of opening those credit card accounts can increase your interest on another credit card. Now, who would have thunk that? No one ever explains that to the  American consumer. No one ever explains that getting at or near your credit limit on a number of credit cards could require your interest rates to go up even if you are paying your bills on time, even if you have always paid exactly what you are supposed to pay on time every month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very important that we get a handle on this. This is a great example. A member of my staff who knows I have been very interested in this brought this in to me this week. We just had a hearing where we learned that if you get to your credit limit, it is possible they will raise your interest rate even if you paid everything on time. Well, what is this? This staff member of mine had several thousand dollars left in available credit on one of his credit cards. So what happens? He gets checks  in the mail from his credit card company, and the first one is made out. Guess how much it is made out for. It is made out for an amount that will get him very close to his credit limit. So the idea here is if you fill them all out, guess what. Bingo. You are over your credit limit, and then all the fees and the extra interest rates start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I have to tell you--by the way, there is nothing on this that says: If you go over your credit limit, not only will we charge you fees, but we are probably going to raise your interest rate. That is never explained to the American consumer. That is not fair play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make it very clear to your credit card customer exactly what they are going to pay for and when. Fifty percent of the people who have credit cards in this country right now are paying minimum balances only, and they don't understand they are in a hole they can't dig out of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit card companies say: We have not had that much increase in defaults. Well, I will tell you, here is what is different: A lot of the credit card debt in this country--hundreds of billions of dollars of the credit card debt in this country--has been rolled into home equity lines of credit because of this housing boom we were on, and everyone was combining their credit cards, and a lot of that debt has been transferred to mortgage debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is stuff that needs to get fixed, it needs to be fair, and the rules need to be clear to anyone because I will tell you, if we don't get it fixed, we are going to be wringing our hands and worrying about the next big problem in our economy, and that is all this unsecured credit that goes unpaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the credit card is a wonderful tool for Americans. It has allowed our country to consume at great levels, has kept our economy pumping. But at the end of the day, if we don't require the credit card companies to make full disclosure in a way that everyone can understand exactly what they are charging for this very expensive form of credit, we are going to regret it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two pieces of legislation. First, Senator Levin and I have introduced a Stop Unfair Credit Card Practices Act which prohibits some of the most egregious examples I have talked about that unfairly deepen or prolong credit card debt held by consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other piece of legislation is one I am cosponsoring with Senator Kohl that deals with college students. Nothing strikes more fear in the heart of a parent who has two children in college than the idea that someone wants to send them credit cards right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I love my two children in college very much. I think they are smart and wonderful people. But, believe me, neither one of them has the resources to handle a credit card right now. The only resources they have to handle a credit card right now are mine. If they want to send me the credit card, that is fine, and if I want to help my kids, that is fine, but the idea that we are now selling lists of college students to credit card companies so they can send them--by the way, one of these credit card  officials actually had the nerve to say in a hearing that he found college students to be a very good risk. Well, yes, because their parents pay it off because they do want not want them to have bad credit when they get out of college. But college students do not have the wherewithal to take on unsecured debt. They are having a hard enough time just getting to class and getting everything done, much less taking on unsecured debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to stop some of these practices that are victimizing the American consumer. We can do it. We can do it in the Senate. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the new year to see if we can't make it a better year for middle-class America that is buried under credit card debt without the playbook to show them how to get out.</paragraph>
