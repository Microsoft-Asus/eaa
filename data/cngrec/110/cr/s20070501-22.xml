    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor the Northern Nevada Center for Independent Living, NNCIL. I am honored to congratulate this organization for their 25 years of dedicated service to the people of northern Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NNCIL has helped disabled citizens in Nevada in all aspects of their lives. They have empowered disabled citizens to become more independent and have given disabled people a stronger voice in matters that directly affect their lives. With the skills taught by NNCIL, disabled people who were benefactors of this program are now participating fully in the community by volunteering in the center and in other service agencies across Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NNCIL has helped disabled citizens thrive socially as well. The center has instituted "recreation night" that has helped disabled people form peer support groups. They have incorporated game night and movie night into their organization to build communities throughout Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The efforts of NNCIL have garnered broad respect and support from the community as a whole. NNCIL has incorporated multiple programs to educate the public concerning issues concerning disabled citizens. They have encouraged Nevada residents to get involved in their communities, and the citizens of northern Nevada have responded by volunteering in a home-modification program that has helped install ramps, handrails, and other improvements to make life easier for disabled people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend NNCIL for their many years of dedicated service to the people of Nevada. They have been an important part of improving the lives of disabled members of our community, and I wish them continued success.</paragraph>
