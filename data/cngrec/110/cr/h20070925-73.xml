  <narrative>THE CONSTITUTIONAL WAR POWERS RESOLUTION OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10886]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, questions of when and how American military forces should be used have become increasingly complex in the 21st century. Threats to international peace and security continue  to evolve. Today the notion of national self-defense has come to include preemptive or preventive military action against those who are perceived to be a threat. A war on terrorism in which the enemy may not always be a specific nation-state  has become the primary defense concerns of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The War Powers Resolution of 1973 was intended to clarify the intent of the constitutional framers and ensure that Congress and the President share in the decision-making process in the event of armed conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, since the enactment of the Resolution, presidents have consistently maintained that the consultation, reporting and congressional authorization requirements of the Resolution are unconstitutional obstacles to executive authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Constitution divides war powers between the legislative and executive branches. Our Constitution states that while the Commander in Chief has the power to conduct war, only Congress has the power to authorize war. Too many times this Congress has abdicated its constitutional duty and allowed Presidents to overstep their constitutional authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As James Madison said, and I quote, "In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature and not to the executive department."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to meet its constitutional responsibility. The framers sought to decentralize the war powers of the United States and construct a balance between the political branches. Because this balance has been both respected and ignored throughout American history, I have today introduced legislation, H.J. Resolution 53, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution that seeks to establish a clear and national policy for today's post-9/11 world. This resolution is a result  of the dedicated work of the Constitutional Project and its War Powers Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitutional War Powers Resolution improves upon the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in a number of ways. It clearly spells out the powers that the Congress and the President must exercise collectively, as well as the defensive measures that the Commander in Chief may exercise without congressional approval. It also provides a more robust reporting requirement to enable Congress to be more informed and to have great oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By more fully clarifying the war powers of the President and the Congress, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution rededicates Congress to its primary constitutional role of deciding when to use force abroad. This resolution protects and preserves the checks and balances that framers intended in the decision to bring our Nation into war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope many of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this legislation. I ask the good Lord in heaven to please bless our men and women in uniform and to continue to bless America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
