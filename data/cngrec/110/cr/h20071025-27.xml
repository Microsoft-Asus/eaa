  <narrative>IT CAME TO PASS -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12092]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there's a phrase that's used in the Bible a number of times: "It came to pass." That really struck me this weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, the Republican majority, it came and it passed. The Democratic majority, it came and it will pass. So that needs to be thought about in these unprecedented procedural rules that shut out so much of America from having representation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have a Rules Committee that says, we'll not allow any amendments. Now put on your evidence about your amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a majority leader that came to the floor and said, we reached out to the other side. I had a meeting this morning about SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill was put on display at 7:30; we didn't even get a copy. You have to come and look at the copy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It came to pass. I don't know how long the majority of the Democrats  will last, but it came and it will pass. And people need to remember they're setting very, very dangerous precedents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It came and it will pass.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
