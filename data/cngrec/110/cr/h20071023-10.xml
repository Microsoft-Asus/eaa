    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce a good friend, a man who ministers to the men and women of western Arkansas, a man of God, our guest chaplain, the Reverend Bobby L. Johnson of Van Buren, Arkansas. He has been pastor of First Assembly of God in Van Buren since June of 1980. Since then, the church has grown from over 200 at Sunday School to over 2,000, placing it among the fastest growing Sunday Schools in Arkansas and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His mission is bringing the Word to the people through his extensive outreach, from mobile ministry to television and over the Internet. A graduate of both the University of Central Arkansas and Evangel College in Missouri, Pastor Johnson has taught public high school and pastored three other churches in Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my honor to welcome Pastor Johnson to the House of Representatives and thank him for his service to his calling and to the people of Arkansas.</paragraph>
