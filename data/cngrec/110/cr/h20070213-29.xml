  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to agree with my colleague from Ohio that we need a course correction in international and domestic policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Congress prepares to debate a nonbinding resolution on Iraq, this administration is already on its way to the next war against Iran. We are losing our democracy to war and to debt. We are borrowing money from China, from Korea and Japan to fight a war in Baghdad and to prepare for war against Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile here at home, there are so many people that lack access to adequate health care, who do not have money for housing or education. We do not have money for job creation, but we have money for war. It is time to stand up for the American people. It is time for Congress to assume its full power under the Constitution. It is time to impose some discipline on this administration. It is time for Congress to truly be a coequal branch of government and to do the work for the American people.</paragraph>
