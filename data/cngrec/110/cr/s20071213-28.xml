    <paragraph>President, it is no surprise why Arkansas is called the Natural State. That is because we have been blessed with a tremendous abundance of mountains, hills, streams, rivers, and lakes that contribute to the beauty of our great State. For generations, national parks and outdoor recreation have played a big part in the lives of Arkansans. They also have been the source of our large tourism industry, attracting tens of thousands of visitors to our State to enjoy all that nature  offers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the crown jewels of our National Forest System is the Ouachita National Forest. Encompassing 1.8 million acres and stretching from western Arkansas to southeastern Oklahoma, the Ouachita National Forest is the largest and oldest national forest in the South. In fact, on December 18, 2007, the Ouachita National Forest will celebrate its 100th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally named the Arkansas National Forest, the Ouachita National Forest was created from public lands south of the Arkansas River by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 18, 1907. In 1926, President Calvin Coolidge renamed the forest the Ouachita National Forest to reflect the name of the mountains and river that run primarily through it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Home to breathtaking mountain views and picturesque streams and lakes, outdoor enthusiasts enjoy recreational activities like camping, boating, biking, and hiking on some of the 37 trails that run throughout the national forest. Its thriving wilderness areas provide ample grounds for fisherman and hunters, including nine different turkey hunting areas throughout the park. The forest also supplies ample timber resources to meet the needs of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the 100th anniversary of the Ouachita National Forest approaches, I wish to express my appreciation for the lasting impact that the national forest has made for the people of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and our great Nation. Ouachita Forest supervisor Norman Wagoner has encouraged citizens to join the park staff in celebrating this historic anniversary at any of the forest's 11 district offices on December 18. The meet and greet will be a wonderful time to reflect on the past contributions of the  park and the tremendous role it has played in Arkansas' heritage.</paragraph>
