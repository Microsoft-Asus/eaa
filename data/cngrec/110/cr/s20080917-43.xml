  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak very briefly to express my sadness on the death of Philip Clapp, who was the president and chief executive officer of the National Environmental Trust, from its founding in 1994 until it merged with the Pew Charitable Trusts this year, and who served as the deputy managing director of the Environmental Group of the Pew Charitable Trusts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few of us in the Senate who have not had contact with Philip and seen the effectiveness of his advocacy on environmental and energy issues. He formerly served on Tim Wirth's staff when Tim served as a colleague of ours in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his guidance, the National Environmental Trust was one of the major nongovernmental organizations that contributed to international summits and agreements on climate change-related issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to express my condolences to his family and to his many colleagues here and abroad who will greatly miss him and his leadership on these issues.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
