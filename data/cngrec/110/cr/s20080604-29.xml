  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="RETIREMENT OF THOMAS E. BARTON">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing Dr. Thomas E. Barton on the occasion of his retirement as president of Greenville Technical College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Barton graduated from Clemson University in 1953 with a bachelor of science degree and received his doctorate in higher education administration from Duke University in 1972. While at Clemson, Dr. Barton played football under legendary coach Frank Howard. In 1987, he was honored for his athletic achievements by being elected to both the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the Clemson University Athletic Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 9 years of service in the public schools of South Carolina and Georgia as teacher, coach, and school superintendent, he became president of Greenville Technical College in 1962. When Dr. Barton began his term as president, Greenville Tech consisted of one building serving 800 students. Forty-six years later, the college boasts a 42-building, four-campus system, offering university transfer and technical programs to more than 60,000 students annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Barton was named Business Person of the Year by Greenville Magazine in 1995, and has consistently been chosen as one of the 50 most influential residents of Greenville by the publication. He was also named one of the top 25 community leaders by the Greenville News in 2000, 2001, and 2002. He has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees from Winthrop University, the University of South Carolina, and Clemson University. In January 2003, he was presented with the Order of the Palmetto, the State's  highest award for a civilian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A leader in community affairs, Barton has served on the governing boards of the Greater Greenville Chamber of Commerce, the Historic Greenville Foundation, and the YMCA. He is a commissioner for the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and has chaired the board of directors of the Donaldson Air Force Base Museum and the South Carolina Technical College Presidents' Council. He has served on the Executive Committee for Friends of the Greenville Hospital System, on the Governor's Task Force  on Education in South Carolina, and as honorary chairman of the March of Dimes Team Walk for Greenville. He is also an active member of the Greenville Rotary Club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Barton has served his State and his community well as an educator and civic leader. I wish him the very best in  his retirement and ask that the U.S. Senate join me in thanking Dr. Barton for his lifelong career of service.</paragraph>
