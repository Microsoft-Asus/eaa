  <speaking speaker="412253" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Congress has a strong record of delivering our promises, real meaningful change, fiscally responsible ways, and instituting a pay-as-you-go policy and doing it in a deficit reduction, disciplined way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Democratic Congress, the majority that we have, has passed three significant things:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number one, we passed legislation last month that instituted the 9/11 Commission recommendations that would improve communications with first responders and would ensure 100 percent screening of airline and seaborne cargo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number two, we established historic energy independence that would reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, number three, this Democratic House, we have made sure to invest in over 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 50,000 new police officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these are just a few examples of how our Democratic Congress majority has taken America in a new direction.</paragraph>
