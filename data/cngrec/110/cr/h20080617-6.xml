    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just last month, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I was privileged to take my first trip to the Promised Land. Israel is the birthright for Jews around the world. As our stanchest ally, Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, but to Jews, it is much more. It is the homeland, the true community that my own Jewish ancestors dreamed of when hounded by anti-Semitism, repression and violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To truly honor Israel on this 60th anniversary, we must seek a true, lasting peace from committed partners to provide for Israel's long-term survival, security and prosperity. For Jews in America, we owe it to our ancestors to protect the Jewish homeland that they toiled for centuries to achieve. We owe to it our grandparents and to our great grandparents who never saw the Promised Land. We owe it to our children and to our grandchildren, who must always know a world with a Jewish homeland. We  owe them peace in our time.</paragraph>
