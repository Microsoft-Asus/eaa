    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, only those who have been to war can truly understand the hell of war. I have not been to war, but I know enough to understand that when our men and women are in harm's way, we should be respectful of the extreme dangers they encounter. Most of us cannot imagine the stress that those in uniform undergo when they have to make a split-second decision as to whether to fire or be fired upon, to kill or be killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently in Afghanistan, the vehicle convoy of U.S. Special Operations marines stationed at Camp Lejeune was struck by a suicide bomber during an ambush. After the incident, why I do not know, an Army official felt compelled to speak out in the press. Whether intentionally or not, this Army officer implicated the marines in the killing of Afghanistan civilians by stating, "Americans have killed and wounded innocent Afghan people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His comments were irresponsible and without respect for his fellow comrades. The four branches of the military are a family. No one in the military family should be in the newspapers criticizing a fellow member of that family who has been faced with death. And, because of his comments to the press, these marines have been publicly indicted as indiscriminate killers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Theodore Roosevelt once said, "A man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards. More than that no man is entitled, and less than that no man shall have."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure due process for these marines, all military officials should refrain from making public comments or expressing their opinions about the incident until the investigation is complete and all the facts are verified. Mr. Speaker, our military servicemembers, the military family, and certainly these marines deserve no less.</paragraph>
