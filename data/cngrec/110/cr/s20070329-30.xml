    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an event that occurred 25 years ago in New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of my colleagues know White Sands Missile Range, WSMR, NM, is a premier test, evaluation and research site, but WSMR's role in the 1982 landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia is less well known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>WSMR's gypsum landing strips visible from space and the excellent weather in New Mexico have made WSMR a potential Space Shuttle launch and landing site since the beginning of NASA's Space Shuttle Program. However, WSMR has never been NASA's first choice for a landing site. But in March of 1982, the preferred landing site at Edwards Air Force Base was soaked with heavy rains. Because it was unclear when the runway surface would be dry enough to support Columbia's landing, WSMR was chosen as an  alternative landing site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Commander Jack R. Lousma and pilot C. Gordon Fullerton landed the Space Shuttle Columbia on WSMR's Northrup Strip at 9:05 a.m. on Tuesday, March 30, 1982. About 4,000 individuals witnessed the landing, and another 90,000 had the opportunity to see the Space Shuttle Columbia at WSMR before its return to Kennedy Space Center. I remember this event as a day of pride for me and my fellow New Mexicans, as our home State played such a visible role in the U.S. space mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I wish to commemorate this important part of White Sands Missile Range's history and honor the men and women who were a part of the Space Shuttle Columbia's landing at WSMR. While the Space Shuttle Columbia has been the only shuttle to land at WSMR, New Mexico stands ready to serve NASA again should the need arise. In fact, as recently as December 2006 NASA officials considered landing the Space Shuttle Discovery at WSMR because of poor conditions at Kennedy Space Center and Edwards Air  Force Base. WSMR prepared for that situation, and I have full confidence that they will continue to work to support NASA and other Federal entities as needed.</paragraph>
