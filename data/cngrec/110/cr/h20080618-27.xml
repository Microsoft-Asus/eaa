  <narrative>REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5488]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we need to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. I couldn't agree more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats are good at making promises, but they need to follow through on those promises. There is one thing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very good at saying--"no."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems like every option we put on the table, whether it's developing the sources of the Outer Continental Shelf, expansion of nuclear power, or opening more refineries in the United States, the answer is always no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Interior estimates that in the Outer Continental Shelf alone, there is almost 100 billion barrels of oil and over 450 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. How high will gas prices have to go before the Democrats  start saying "yes"? $5 a gallon? $10 a gallon?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time for no more excuses. Families are hurting. Businesses are hurting. The American people are asking for help. It's time to say "yes."</paragraph>
