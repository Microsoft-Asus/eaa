  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 499--URGING PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT MAHMOUD ABBAS, WHO IS ALSO THE HEAD OF THE FATAH PARTY, TO OFFICIALLY ABROGATE THE 10 ARTICLES IN THE FATAH CONSTITUTION THAT CALL FOR ISRAEL'S DESTRUCTION AND TERRORISM AGAINST ISRAEL, OPPOSE ANY POLITICAL SOLUTION, AND LABEL ZIONISM AS RACISM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to offer legislation to encourage Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is also the chairman of the Fatah Party, to officially abrogate the 10 articles in the Fatah Constitution that call for Israel's destruction and terrorism against Israel, oppose any political solution, and label Zionism as racism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to move the Middle East peace process forward, it is necessary that the Fatah Party recognize Israel's legitimacy. The Fatah Constitution makes this impossible. At present, 10 articles in the constitution oppose Israel and Zionism. They read as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) "Article [4]: The Palestinian struggle is part and parcel of the world-wide struggle against Zionism, colonialism and international imperialism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) "Article [7]: The Zionist Movement is racial, colonial and aggressive in ideology, goals, organization and method."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) "Article [8]: The Israeli existence in Palestine is a Zionist invasion with a colonial expansive base, and it is a natural ally to colonialism and international imperialism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(4) "Article [12]: Complete liberation of Palestine, and eradication of Zionist economic, political, military and cultural existence."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(5) "Article [17]: Armed public revolution is the inevitable method to liberating Palestine."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(6) "Article [19]: Armed struggle is a strategy and not a tactic, and the Palestinian Arab People's armed revolution is a decisive factor in the liberation fight and in uprooting the Zionist existence, and this struggle will not cease unless the Zionist state is demolished and Palestine is completely liberated."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(7) "Article [22]: Opposing any political solution offered as an alternative to demolishing the Zionist occupation in Palestine, as well as any project intended to liquidate the Palestinian case or impose any international mandate on its people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(8) "Article [23]: Maintaining relations with Arab countries ..... with the proviso that the armed struggle is not negatively affected."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(9) "Article [24]: Maintaining relations with all liberal forces supporting our just struggle in order to resist Zionism and imperialism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(10) "Article [25]: Convincing concerned countries in the world to prevent Jewish immigration to Palestine as a method of solving the problem."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of the Mideast peace process has been tortuous. There have been so many developments since Israel emerged as a state in 1949. The enmity, which has existed for thousands of years, has meant senseless killing, terrorism in Israel, and Hezbollah firing rockets into northern Israel, prompting the justified retaliation by Israel as a matter of self-defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has changed since the Fatah Constitution was written in 1964. While some question the relevance of the document with respect to the day-to-day operations of the Palestinian Government, the fact remains that the language is incendiary. By striking the polemical language from its constitution, Fatah would be setting an example for the Arab world. It would demonstrate that the Palestinian leadership understands the importance of words and perceptions in the peace process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the first time I have addressed such an issue. In 1994, the U.S. Congress adopted an amendment put forward by Senator SHELBY and myself, which conditioned U.S. aid on the Palestinian Liberation Organization's elimination of provisions in its charter that called for the destruction of Israel. The amendment was accepted by the U.S. Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem of the institutionalization of inflammatory language in the Middle East extends beyond the Fatah Constitution. The Center for Religious Freedom, formerly affiliated with Freedom House, in a 2006 report entitled "Saudi Arabia's Curriculum of Intolerance," stated that despite 2005 statements by the Saudi Foreign Minister that their educational curricula have been reformed, this is "simply not the case." On the contrary, religious textbooks continue to advocate the destruction of  any non-Wahhabi Muslim. Saudi Arabia has established Wahhabism, an extreme form of Islam, as the official state doctrine, and about 5 million children are instructed each year in Islamic studies using Saudi Ministry of Education textbooks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My intent in bringing the Fatah Constitution into focus now is not to undermine the Presidency of Mahmoud Abbas. Rather, my intent is to ensure that these problems of perception are addressed now so that all parties can take further steps towards peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The November 27, 2007, Joint Israeli-Palestinian Declaration at Annapolis stated, "We express our determination to bring an end to bloodshed, suffering and decades of conflict between our peoples; to usher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, security, justice, dignity, respect and mutual recognition; to propagate a culture of peace and nonviolence; to confront terrorism and incitement, whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated on October 15, 2007, in Ramallah, "If you're going to have a two-state solution, you have to accept the right of the other party to exist. If you're going to have a two-state solution that is born of negotiation, you're going to have to renounce violence." I urge President Abbas to take action, not only in words, but with deeds.</paragraph>
