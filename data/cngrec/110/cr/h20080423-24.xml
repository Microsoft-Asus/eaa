  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this morning I had a group of students from Hawkins Mill Elementary School in Memphis tour the Capitol, inner city young children. And I thought about what type of future they'll have and how Congress is affecting it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought of the children's health plan that would give six million more children around this country health care, and the fact that the President vetoed their opportunity to have health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought about No Child Left Behind to help them in education. But that bill has been $50 billion underfunded, and basically teaches teachers to teach a test and not to teach these children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought about the war in Iraq and John McCain's thought that it's going to be a hundred-year war, and how many of them might have to go to Iraq and maybe lose their lives and continue to suck moneys out of our economy and hinder their future with a budget that is out of balance and that they'll have to pay for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm concerned about the children at Hawkins Mill Elementary and all the other children and the future we leave them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, November's the answer. We need to have a new Senate and a new President that think about the children and the future.</paragraph>
