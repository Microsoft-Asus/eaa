    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, "I do not believe that the men who served in uniform in Vietnam have been given the credit they deserve. It was a difficult war against an unorthodox enemy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the words of General Westmoreland in the war where "all gave some and some gave all." But the disrespect continues. Now, despicable vandals have desecrated the sacred black granite Vietnam Wall. An oily, slimy, greasy substance was smeared over the Wall and the walkway. The Park Service is attempting to remove the damage, but the monument desecraters run free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This monument bears the name of 56,000 warriors. They answered the call for America and they died in their youth. I grew up with friends whose names are on that wall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unpatriotic, cowardly, abusing criminals should be tracked down, prosecuted, and put in jail somewhere off the shores of America, maybe Guantanamo Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been said that "Vietnam was a war that asked everything of a few and nothing of most in America." Now America must be resolved to capture these outlaws and restore dignity to those who died for the rest of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
