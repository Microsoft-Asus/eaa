    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2467">H.R. 2467</bill>, which will designate the U.S. Postal Service building at 69 Montgomery Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, as the "Frank J. Guarini Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frank Guarini was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and has served his State and country in a variety of positions. Early in his career, he was commissioned as a Naval officer at Columbia University and went on to serve in the United States Navy aboard the USS Mount McKinley, receiving the Naval Commendation Medal and three battle stars during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, he was elected to the New Jersey State Senate where he served for the next 7 years. On January 3, 1979, he was elected to represent New Jersey's 14th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives, completing seven terms before retiring in 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, Frank Guarini was a true champion for education, serving as the chief sponsor of legislation that encouraged employers to provide educational assistance to its employees tax free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after his retirement, Frank Guarini's commitment to education and public service has not wavered. In 1994, he established the Guarini Center for Government Affairs at St. Peter's College in Jersey City, New Jersey, which strives to provide a forum for nonpartisan discussion of public policy issues and encourages today's students to take up careers in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A central part of the Guarini Center's mission is to promote critical thinking and debate among the next generation of leaders at its Annual High School Oratorical Contest. The event is open to all high school students in New Jersey and throughout the tri-State area and attracts more than 100 students from 75 schools to compete each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Frank Guarini for many years, and I can personally attest to the commitment and passion that he has for the State of New Jersey and this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I can think of no better way to honor the public service of this former New Jersey Congressman than to designate a U.S. postal office in his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

Early in his career, he was commissioned as a naval officer at Columbia University and went on to serve in the United States Navy aboard the USS Mount McKinley.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2467">H.R. 2467</bill>, which would designate the Post Office facility located at 69 Montgomery Street in Jersey City, NJ, as the "Frank J. Guarini Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Congressman Frank J. Guarini represented the 14th Congressional District of New Jersey for 14 years, from 1979 to 1993. He did so in an exemplary fashion, serving his constituents, and all Americans, in a way in which we should strive to attain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of his intellect and work ethic he became a rising star early in his career. He was the first Representative to be appointed to the Ways and Means Committee during his first term in Congress in over 200 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While on this vital committee, Mr. Guarini worked to modernize our trade and tariff laws with heads of state to assure that other countries open their markets to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of this work, he received the award "for outstanding contributions to the administration of justice in International Trade Law" from the U.S. Court of International Trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also served with Chairman Charles Rangel and Ben Gilman on the Select Committee on Narcotic Abuse, developing expertise on drug issues and bringing about vital legislation and strategies to fight the war against drugs both here and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Mr. Guarini was a senior member of the Budget Committee, where he chaired the Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues. Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Guarini was an outspoken advocate for fiscal responsibility and fought to provide education and job opportunities for our Nation's young while also reducing wasteful government spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since his retirement from Government service, Congressman Guarini has proudly served as the National Italian-American Foundation's chairman emeritus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chair of the Italian-American Congressional Delegation, Frank and I often work together to promote Italian-American culture and traditions in the United States Congress. Just like his congressional career, he does an extraordinary job on this front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be the first New Jersey Member of Congress to serve on the Ways and Means Committee since Mr. Guarini's retirement in 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Guarini was a great Member of this body and I am honored to call him my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my New Jersey colleague Albio Sires for introducing this resolution and honoring Mr. Guarini, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.</paragraph>
