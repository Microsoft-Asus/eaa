    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commend Yale University and the Government of Peru on their agreement to settle a 6-year-long dispute over Incan artifacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 100 years ago, Yale history professor Hiram Bingham made a historic archeological discovery near the famed Incan city of Machu Picchu. His find, which included over 300 artifacts, featuring rare examples of jewelry and ceramic pottery, helped bring worldwide attention to the rich culture of the Incan peoples. For the past 95 years, these artifacts, which were claimed by the Peruvian Government, have been in the possession of Yale University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The landmark agreement, reached on September 14, 2007, between Yale University and the Government of Peru, which includes the creation of a traveling international exhibition featuring these priceless historical artifacts, is a symbol of both parties' dedication to international cooperation and scholarship. I applaud Yale University and the Peruvian Government for finding a compromise that will allow scholars, students, and interested people from across the globe and from all walks of life to  enjoy these splendid cultural artifacts for generations to come.</paragraph>
