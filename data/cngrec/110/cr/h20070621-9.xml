  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition and appreciation of Rob Portman and his service to our great Nation, first, as a fellow Member of the House; then as United States Trade Representative; and, most recently, as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rob has proven to be an outstanding public servant. I know that Jim Nussle will be a competent successor and carry on in Rob's footsteps for the taxpayers. I am grateful my Republican colleagues and I had the opportunity a few minutes ago to thank Rob and wish him well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rob was the featured guest for our weekly Theme Team meeting. I appreciate Theme Team chairman JACK KINGSTON and Krista Cole on his staff for bringing a top-notch speaker every week. I wish Rob, his wife, Jane, and their three children, Jed, Will, and Sally, all the best in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
