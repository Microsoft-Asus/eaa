  <narrative>BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS SOMETHING THE ENTIRE CONGRESS SHOULD SUPPORT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11077]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week the House and Senate passed a bill ensuring that 10 million low-income children have access to the quality health care coverage they need to live healthy and productive lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats and Republicans alike worked together to do what was right for our Nation's children. This bipartisan agreement will strengthen the SCHIP program over the next 5 years by ensuring that an additional 4 million low-income children receive access to health care coverage they desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when the number of uninsured children is increasing, we need to do more, more to ensure that they have access to quality health care, and that is what this bipartisan agreement does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite strong bipartisan support here in Congress, President Bush is threatening to veto this bill. Instead, he favors a plan that would take health care coverage away from needy children. A million children would lose health insurance coverage. He should reconsider his veto threat and support our bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
