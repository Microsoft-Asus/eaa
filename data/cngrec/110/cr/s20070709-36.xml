  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a community in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th anniversary. On July 20 to 22, the residents of Portland will gather to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rural community of Portland is located in the beautiful and serene valley of the Goose River. Like so many rural towns in North Dakota, Portland was established by a railroad. The town was named Portland because railroad officials considered it the midway point between Portland, ME, and Portland, OR. In 1883 it was incorporated as  a village. The Dakota territory's first insurance company was chartered in Portland in 1885.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Portland has come a long way since its beginnings in the early 1880s. The town has built a rich heritage of agriculture but has also grown to incorporate technology, manufacturing, and health services. Portland has been described by its citizens as the way America is supposed to be. The MayPort Community Center offers the chance for recreational activities such as ice skating and hockey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community of Portland is the ideal location for its residents to grow and prosper together. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the town will hold several golf tournaments, a parade, comedic acts, and a street dance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Portland, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Portland and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Portland that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Portland has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
