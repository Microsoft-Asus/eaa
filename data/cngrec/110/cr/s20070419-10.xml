    <paragraph>With regard to today's remembrance of the Holocaust, at today's 2007 National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance ceremony, I will have the honor of lighting a candle alongside Holocaust survivor Eva Cooper. Eva was 10 years old when Nazis invaded her hometown of Budapest. She survived in hiding until Soviet forces liberated her and her family in 1945.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hearing stories like Eva's reminds us that the Holocaust was not one act of evil, but millions, an evil that slaughtered little children and horrified nations. Today, we remember evil and the strength and courage of those who lived under its dark reign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As time marches ever forward, fewer survivors like Eva Cooper will still live to tell us firsthand of the horrors they saw. That is why the mission of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the host of today's event, is so very important. History must never forget the horror committed against the Jewish people, so that horror of such magnitude can never, never happen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's ceremony will also serve to remind us of the strength of the Jewish people in the face of atrocity. The resilience of those who survived, and the determination of those who remember, is proof that the dignity of the human soul will never be trampled by oppression, injustice, or terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
