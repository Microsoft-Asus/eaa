  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for today's cloture votes on the Rockefeller-Bond Substitute amendment No. 3911 and the Reid amendment No. 3918 to <bill type="s" number="2246">S. 2246</bill>, the FISA legislation. Had I been present, I would have voted "no" on No. 3911 and "aye" on No. 3918.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that now is the time for the full Senate to consider and debate the difficult questions raised in this legislation. The Senate should consider and vote on important amendments relating to the protection of Americans' civil liberties and the question of immunity for telecommunications providers.</paragraph>
