    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="923">H. Res. 923</bill>, which recognizes the 150th anniversary of the State of Minnesota and highlights its contributions to America's economy and heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="923">H. Res. 923</bill> was introduced by our colleague, Congresswoman MICHELLE BACHMANN of Minnesota, on January 16, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2008, by voice vote. This measure has the support and cosponsorship of 120 Members of Congress, including all of the Members from the State of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 2, 1849, Minnesota was established as a territory, and it became the 32nd State on March 11, 1858. Also known as the Gopher State, the North Star State, and the Land of 10,000 Lakes, Minnesota's name comes from the Dakota word "minesota," meaning "water that reflects the sky."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota has been and continues to be a leader in innovation in science and education. It is home of the Mayo Clinic, which is known for its cutting-edge medical work, and over 30 institutions of higher education, including the University of Minnesota, a world-class research university, which performed the first open heart surgery and the first bone marrow transplant in America. I should also mention that Minnesota is currently home to more than 35 Fortune 500 companies and is leading the Nation  in the production and use of renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota for sponsoring the measure at hand. Given the 150th anniversary of Minnesota's statehood and the enormous contributions Minnesota has made to our Nation and the world, I urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution seeks to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Minnesota becoming a State. In February of 1857, Congress passed an enabling act that defined the State boundaries and authorized the establishment of a State government for the people of Minnesota. Among other things, it called for a convention to establish a State constitution. As is normal in a democracy, the Democrats and Republicans could not come to a final agreement on language, which resulted in the drafting of  two distinct constitutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ultimately, a conference committee of five members from each party was formed in order to work out the differences and create one constitution both sides could agree to. This happened in August of 1857. Although neither party agreed to sign along with members of the other party, a consensus on the language was agreed upon and two copies were made and signed. Minnesota's State constitution was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few months later, on May 11, 1858, President James Buchanan signed legislation granting statehood to Minnesota, making it the 32nd State in the Union. Until that point, Minnesota held the status of a territory for more than 9 years. Henry Hastings Sibley, the State's first Governor, famously uttered Minnesota is finally free "from the trammels of territorial vassalage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this occasion of the sesquicentennial, it is important that we recognize all that Minnesota has to offer. It is truly a time of celebration for the 5 million-plus residents of Minnesota, and there is a lot to celebrate. Its geography and terrain are among the most precious and beautiful our Nation has to offer. It is home to the headwaters of the mighty Mississippi River, which has been so crucial to the development of the economic viability of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota is a land rich in natural resources and remains among the leaders in agriculture and iron production. Minnesota's farming industry feeds and nourishes many of our Nation's citizens today. Minnesotans are known to be a people with a sense of pride in their history and tradition. Many Minnesotans have had profound impact on the lives of people all across our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>For instance, the founders of the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, Dr. William Mayo and his two sons, William and Charles, began their practice in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota is also the birthplace of one of America's greatest literary figures and favorite authors, F. Scott Fitzgerald. His literary works have reached millions and continue to have a great impact on our youth. Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" is regarded as one of the great American novels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, the State of Minnesota is one that is rich in nature, resources, and, most importantly, in people and heritage. For this reason, I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="923">H. Res. 923</bill>, recognizing the State of Minnesota's 150th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="923">H. Res. 923</bill>, recognizing the 150th anniversary of the great State of Minnesota. While I rise in support and recognition of this anniversary, I also rise to remind my colleagues that we must address rising fuel prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some have blamed rising fuel prices on those who own and manage big oil companies. In a recent study, however, Robert Shapiro, Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs under President Bill Clinton, found that the vast majority of oil and natural gas company shares are owned broadly by middle-income Americans through mutual funds, pension funds and individual retirement accounts, while a mere 1.5 percent of the shares of public oil companies are owned by company executives. That means that  when Congress levies additional taxes on oil companies, the American public will pay for that tax in one of two ways; either through their pension or mutual funds, or by paying a higher price at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, increasing taxes is not the answer to rising fuel prices.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a wonderful, delightful resolution to be able to speak on this afternoon. It is the State of Minnesota's 150th birthday. We have had a big party all year, we are going to continue to have a big party all year, and it is my honor to be able to present this resolution before our distinguished body and also to let the American people know the entire Minnesota delegation has joined me on this resolution. All Democrats, all Republicans, we are united in this great party of celebrating Minnesota's  150th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as this resolution's author, I rise to support House Resolution 923. As Minnesota turns a very proud 150 years old, we are no worse for the wear as a State, and I am very honored to recognize the contributions that Minnesota has made to the United States economy and to our great heritage of freedom and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 3rd, 1849, Minnesota was established as a United States territory as part of the Northwest Territory, and later we became the 32nd State in this great country, on May 11, 1858.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota is now home to over 5 million very lucky people. Minnesota is renowned for our welcoming communities, our high quality schools and our valuable natural resources. Minnesotans take advantage of those resources every weekend that we can, our beautiful lakes, our forests, our prairies. "Minnesota Nice" is more than a saying for us; it is our way of life, and we welcome you to come and enjoy our hospitality any time you get to our great State of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also known as the Gopher State. We are also known as the North Star State and the Land of 10,000 Lakes. But, truth be told, we actually have over 15,000 lakes in our great State. Our name comes from the Dakota word "minesota," which means "water that reflects the sky," in other words, sky blue waters. And it is that, and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Native Americans continue to play an extremely important role in Minnesota and a defining role in our very proud heritage. The influence of the Native Americans can be seen not only in the names of our local towns, our local lakes and our natural landmarks, but also in the enduring culture of conservation of the land and the great love that every Minnesotan shares and our bond with the outdoors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was in 1889 that the Saint Mary's Hospital, now known as the world famous Mayo Clinic, opened its doors to patients in Rochester, Minnesota. They are now known worldwide for their cutting-edge care, and quite often in the news we will hear of yet one more world leader who makes their way to little Rochester, Minnesota, to receive what we know in Minnesota is the finest health care system in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota also houses, Mr. Speaker, over 30 institutions of higher education. Education is a very strong value in the State of Minnesota, including the world renowned University of Minnesota, a world class research university of which we are all extremely proud and where the Nation's and world's first open heart surgery was performed and also the first bone marrow transplant was performed in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesota continues to be a leader in innovation. In fact, Minnesota is currently home to more than 35 Fortune 500 companies. Yes, we are the State, Mr. Speaker, that gave you SPAM, and we are the State that gave you the Post-it note.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But our rise in corporate and technological prominence has not compromised our agricultural background. Farmland spans over half of Minnesota's 54 million acres. My father was born on a farm and grew up on a farm, and farming is a way of life for many of our Minnesota people. The ag industry is a jewel in Minnesota and it is Minnesota's second largest job market, employing nearly 80,000 farmers that serve to feed the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when energy costs and production are dominating the headlines, Minnesota is a national leader in the protection and use of renewable energy. We are very proud of this fact, and it helps our Nation reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 150 years, Mr. Speaker, Minnesota has attracted a very special caliber of people, marked by our spirit and by our character. The citizens of the State of Minnesota are dedicated to our families. Families are very important. Faith is very important in our State, our communities, and also in our Nation. We are people of faith. We are people of charity. We are people of hope and dedication, love and compassion. We have a very high rate of giving in the State of Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope you and my fellow colleagues will join me in recognizing the rich history and the substantial contributions that Minnesota and Minnesotans have made to this great Nation. We have a lot to be proud of, Mr. Speaker, and this legislation marks yet one more happy milestone in Minnesota's long history of success.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to one of the cosponsors of this resolution, Representative Walz from Minnesota.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Davis, for managing the bill. A special thank you to my colleague from a little further upstate in Minnesota, Mrs. Bachmann. Thank you for your kind words. Your pride and enthusiasm for our State is evident, and I think all of us who live there understand why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, rise to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the great State of Minnesota, the 32nd State. It is our sesquicentennial, 150 years. From the natural beauty of the Mississippi River, across to the plains near South Dakota, this is a State that amongst the stark beauty has planted the seeds, as you heard my previous colleague talk about, of innovation, from health care to computer technology to agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially proud to represent the southern area of the State, the First District, those many towns, like Winona along the Mississippi River, which were the stopping points near the upper end of the paddle boats that brought our forebearers to Minnesota. The courthouses and the city halls still represent that long heritage, that rich tradition and that sense of community that had people staking out a new life in the "big woods," in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have the City of New Ulm in my district. New Ulm is, as you might expect, a very, very German town. It boasts the "Herman the German" statue that is the second largest brass statue behind only the Statue of Liberty in the United States. There is the proud tradition of the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame that captures the tradition of the many musicians and folk artists that have come through and lived in Minnesota. Both Winona and New Ulm were capitals of a day, and I am very proud  of them during the sesquicentennial celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The City of Rochester, as you heard my colleague mention, the small town on the prairie that the Mayo brothers opened the door to a hospital and have established the most advanced critical hospital in probably the world. The Mayo Clinic is a destination. You must fly there to get there. There is not a large city to draw you there, but there is the absolute guarantee of the most quality care that you can receive anywhere in the world. They are leading the way not only in innovations in medical  research, they are leading the way in how we deliver health care to all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also the City of Austin, known for many, many things, and one also you heard my colleague mention, the invention of SPAM and the SPAM Museum. Mr. Speaker, I invite you and anyone to please visit this wonderful place. You will find out how SPAM is made, first and foremost, but it also is something about the Hormel Institute and this other great company. They have a research lab that is there that is called the Hormel Institute. By most accounts the Hormel Institute will feature the international  conference on carcinogens and in cancer research, especially melanomas, and the Hormel Institute, when the story of how cancer is solved, it will probably start in Austin, Minnesota. It is something we are very proud of, a public-private partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnesotans have always prided themselves on their education, of investing in their children. Garrison Keillor talks about all of our children are above average. We know that we have a ways to go, but we do take pride in that, from our many, many public schools and institutions of higher learning, producing one of the highest graduation rates in the country, and usually in the very top three of all SAT and ACT scores. So there is a great pride in this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is those residents of Southern Minnesota that I am here today to congratulate, people who have chosen to live in a somewhat harsh climate, to take the opportunity to settle this land, to move into the Upper Midwest and to settle and create not just places to live, but communities that were vibrant and growing, and that understood that the investments we put  back in them would benefit this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I am proud of our State. I am proud of what our State contributes to this Nation, just like our other 49 States and territories do. This Nation is strongest when we are altogether, and admission of Minnesota as the 32nd State strengthened this great Union. Today I say congratulations to all Minnesotans, and we are looking forward to the next 150 years.</paragraph>
