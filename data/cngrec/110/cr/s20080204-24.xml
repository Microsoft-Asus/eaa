    <paragraph>Madam President, I appreciate this opportunity to join my many friends from the Hispanic community in Indiana and across the country as we celebrate the 78th anniversary of the founding of the League of United Latin American Citizens, better known as LULAC. This is a significant milestone and one in which LULAC's members should take great pride.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception on February 17, 1929, in Corpus Christi, TX, LULAC has championed the cause of Hispanic-Americans in education, employment, economic development, and civil rights. To carry out this mission, LULAC has developed a comprehensive set of nationwide programs fostering educational attainment, job training, housing, scholarships, citizenship, and voter registration. Through the years, LULAC's dedication to fostering greater opportunities for young people through its scholarship opportunities  has been remarkable. It has enabled thousands to pursue and reach their higher education goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, LULAC is recognized as the largest and oldest Hispanic civil rights and service organization in the United States. LULAC's commitment to the advancement of Latinos through its 700 chapters nationwide has served as a model to many other emerging coalitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of Hispanic-Americans have worked tirelessly to provide for their families, strengthen their communities, and enrich our national culture. I wish LULAC and its members every success as they work on behalf of Hispanic-Americans across our State and Nation.</paragraph>
