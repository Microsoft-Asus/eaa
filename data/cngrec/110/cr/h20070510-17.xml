  <speaking speaker="400259" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I will introduce a bipartisan piece of legislation that will keep newborn babies and young children alive and healthy in the world's poorest countries. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the United States Commitment to the Global Child Survival Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, more than 10 million newborns and children under 5 die. That is 28,000 babies and toddlers dying every day. Pneumonia, diarrhea and malnutrition needlessly kill millions. Sixty percent of newborns and young children die needlessly from treatable or preventable problems just because they are poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill expands access to the basics, antibiotics, vaccines, vitamins, antimalaria drugs, which will save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the United States Commitment to the Global Child Survival Act and to invest in keeping newborns and young children and their mothers healthy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
