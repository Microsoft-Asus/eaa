  <narrative>The text of the Senate joint resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="sj" number="7">S.J. Res. 7</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, in accordance with section 5581 of the Revised Statutes (20 U.S.C. 43), the vacancy on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, in the class other than Members of Congress, occurring because of the expiration of the term of Roger W. Sant of Washington, D.C., is filled by the reappointment of Roger W. Sant, for a term of 6 years, effective October 25, 2007.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this joint resolution will reappoint Roger W. Sant to be a citizen regent of the Smithsonian Institution for a second 6-year term. The last few years have been very difficult ones for the Smithsonian. The aftermath of the September 11 attacks  caused a significant drop in public attendance at the Smithsonian facilities, which has only recently begun to bounce back. Many believe the Institution has become too closely identified with donors  and corporate sponsors of its buildings and activities, which threatens its reputation for independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the House Administration Committee thought long and hard about whether it would be appropriate to replace some members of the Board of Regents. In prior years, the committee had essentially rubber-stamped appointment recommendations from the board, and candidates seeking a second term routinely received it. This year, two citizens regents are seeking reappointment, including Mr. Sant, and two additional seats will be filled by new members who have who not yet been recommended to  us. So there is a process of natural rotation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ultimately decided to give the board more time to implement the promising reforms recommended both by its Governance Committee and the Independent Review Committee. The committee expects the board to appoint a secretary who will be fully responsive to the board and protect the values the American public has expected of the Smithsonian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of the process of considering this joint resolution, committee members met with Mr. Sant 2 weeks ago to hear his views about recent events in the Smithsonian and assessment of the pace of the ongoing reforms at the Institution. We were cautiously optimistic that the board is on the right track. Mr. Sant has broad understanding of the Smithsonian operation and its past flaws, and we believe he can make a useful contribution to the restructuring of the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also informed the committee that he is not running for the new and enhanced position of chairman of the board, which is expected to be created January 2008 as one of the principal reform recommendations. We think the new occupant of this position should bring a fresh perspective of the management of the board's affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, we have decided to recommend Mr. Sant's reappointment to the board for a second 6-year term and urge his approval by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the House Administration Committee, I am pleased to support <bill type="sj" number="7">S.J. Res. 7</bill>, a bill that allows for the reappointment of Roger Sant as a citizen regent of the Smithsonian Institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several other members of the Committee on House Administration and I had the opportunity recently to meet with Mr. Sant and discuss the road ahead for the Smithsonian in this time of change and opportunity, and also to discuss the mistakes of the past. Mr. Sant assured me that, with his reappointment, he would do his part to ensure that the "Nation's attic," which is the common name for the Smithsonian, is not being looted by those who have put personal gain above the interests of the Institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last Congress, this committee conducted an oversight hearing into Smithsonian Business Ventures in what would turn out to be a prophetic concern about the museum's financial operations. While my colleague Chairman Brady and and I are committed to continuing vigorous oversight of the Smithsonian, an effective and engaged Board of Regents is an essential first line of defense in ensuring that we do not experience a repeat of those problems that plagued the immediate past president  of the Smithsonian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident, based on the statements made by Mr. Sant, that he is committed to earning back the trust of the Congress and the American people regarding the board's role of safeguarding our Nation's most treasured assets and ensuring proper governance of the Smithsonian and all its different enterprises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the leadership given by the chairman of this committee, Mr. Brady, and the way he has taken hold of this issue, among others, and I am pleased to join him in approving this resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the reappointment of Roger Sant to the Smithsonian Board of Regents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a new member of the Board of Regents since January. And although the past eleven months have been challenging for the Smithsonian . . . this period of transition will result in a new Secretary, an improved governance structure and a stronger relationship with Congress and the American people. I believe that much of the changes can be attributed to Mr. Sant's leadership during this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March, Mr. Sant led the effort to create both an Independent Review Committee, headed by Chuck Bowsher, formerly the Comptroller General of the United States ..... and an internal Governance Committee, on which I serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of both of the committees' work, the Regents adopted a comprehensive set of governance reforms, comprised of 25 specific changes in June, 2007. In broad terms, these reforms will ensure that the Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Smithsonian work together in a constructive partnership, and will improve the Smithsonian's culture of accountability and transparency. To date, eleven of these 25 reforms have been implemented in whole or in part, and the remainder will be implemented  by May, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Mr. Sant serves on the new Facilities Revitalization Committee. The Committee is addressing shortfalls in funding for Smithsonian facilities revitalization and maintenance, estimated to require $1 billion above current funding levels over the next ten years. The Regents are hard at work developing a plan to fund this shortfall and return the Smithsonian's museums and other facilities to the condition expected by the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues and I on the Board of Regents are fully committed to ensuring that the Institution operates at the highest level of integrity and transparency. Mr. Sant has been involved at every level of reform and has done a tremendous amount of work, as have my fellow Regents. The Board is guided by the same principals that guide our work in Congress . . . operating as a public trust . . . following only the highest ethical standards . . . and conducting business with an increased ethos of transparency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Board's accomplishments during these few months are notable, as are its plans for future improvements. The Board of Regents is currently conducting a search for a new Secretary, and is still in the midst of a thorough and thoughtful process to reform its governance structure. We have the momentum and the dedication from the Board Members and need to be able to continue our work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Chairman Brady and Ranking Member EHLERS for moving Mr. Sant's reappointment at this time. And for their continued commitment to the betterment of the Institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me conclude by saying that each year, over 25 million visitors come to the Smithsonian. The National Collections, containing over 135 million items, are cared for, displayed, and made available for research by this beloved institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Smithsonian faces many challenges as it pursues its mission for "the increase and diffusion of knowledge." While the Board works to find a new Secretary, institute governance reforms and address facilities needs ..... the Smithsonian continues to mount world-class exhibitions and conduct cutting-edge research in science, history, art, and culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Smithsonian offers a uniquely American experience to all of our constituents when they come to the nation's capitol. Mr. Sant's dedication and commitment to the Smithsonian benefit us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to support his reappointment to ensure that all of the reforms that he has helped to implement are executed in a prompt and timely manner. I thank him for his leadership during this period of transition.</paragraph>
