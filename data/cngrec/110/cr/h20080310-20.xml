    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleagues from the Empire State of New York in consideration of <bill type="h" number="3196">H.R. 3196</bill>, which renames a postal facility in Port Jervis, New York, in honor of E. Arthur Gray, former mayor and statesman from Orange County, New York. <bill type="h" number="3196">H.R. 3196</bill> enjoys the support of the entire congressional delegation from New York, and was introduced by my colleague Representative John Hall back on July 26, 2007. The measure was taken up  by the Oversight Committee on February 26, 2008, and was passed by a voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3196">H.R. 3196</bill> calls for honoring E. Arthur Gray's service to his community, State, and therefore his country by designating the post office in his hometown of Port Jervis, New York, as the E. Arthur Gray Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>E. Arthur Gray was Port Jervis's longest serving mayor, completing 5 1/2  terms from 1978 to 1988. After his tenure as mayor, in 1988 Gray became a New York State senator by ousting a 16-year incumbent. Gray represented New York's 39th District during his time in the New York legislature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native and lifelong resident of Port Jervis, Gray began his professional career as cofounder and director of Gray-Parker Funeral Home in Port Jervis, New York, before entering the realm of public service and politics. Well-known throughout Orange County, New York, for his stellar high school basketball days at Port Jervis High School and as a World War II veteran, Gray gave unselfishly of himself by serving as the chairman of the Port Jervis Community Development Agency, a member of the Orange  County Economic Development Agency and as chairman of the National League of Small Cities Advisory Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in honor of E. Arthur Gray's public service and compassionate spirit, let us pass without reservation <bill type="h" number="3196">H.R. 3196</bill> and rename the postal facility on Sussex Street in Port Jervis, New York, after this great American citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 20 Sussex Street in Port Jervis, New York, as the E. Arthur Gray Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Port Jervis, Arthur Gray spent a lifetime serving his community, State, and country. He was well-known in the community, first as a high school basketball star, then as a veteran of the Second World War who later became a local funeral home director.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Gray accomplished a lot by the time he was elected to his first term as mayor of Port Jervis in 1978. Described as generous and always willing to lend a helping hand, Mayor Gray was the longest serving mayor in the history of Port Jervis, maintaining his position for five and a half terms until 1988, when he was elected to represent the 34th District in the New York State Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His commitment to the community extended far beyond his office doors. He was a former member and chairman of the Port Jervis Community Development Agency, a former member of the Orange County Economic Development Agency, former chairman of the National League of Small Cities Advisory Council, and participated in numerous local boards and organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Arthur Gray died on April 10, 2007, at the age of 82. A loving husband, father of two, grandfather, and truly dedicated public servant, Arthur Gray exemplified civic duty and social responsibility. His contributions to his community and beyond will not soon be forgotten, and I urge that we accept this bill memorializing the tremendous life of this man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
