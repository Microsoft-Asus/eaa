  <narrative>CONGRATULATING DAVID COOK -- (Senate - May 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4788">S4788</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to congratulate a Missourian who has accomplished something truly remarkable. We have known our share of champions in Missouri, like the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals and the Big 12 North winning University of Missouri football team. We have also had our share of great entertainers, like Josephine Baker, Scott Joplin, and Sheryl Crow. But it is very rare that we have someone who is both. Last night, David Cook, a native of Blue Springs, MO, and a graduate  of Central Missouri State University, achieved that rare combination when he was crowned winner of "American Idol."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David's victory was remarkable even by "American Idol's" standards. The show has become one of the greatest competitions the country has ever witnessed. It is ubiquitous. It is practically unavoidable. And with the eyes of the whole country watching, David Cook won "American Idol" by the incredible margin of 12 million votes out of a record 97.5 million votes cast. His performances, along with those of David Archuleta, the other worthy finalist, drew in more viewers than watched the season  finale last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is telling of the graciousness and humility of this superbly talented young man that David didn't even intend to try out for the show. The only reason he was at the audition was to support his brother. But while entering the contest may have been accidental, it is no accident that the country voted him the next "American Idol." His easy confidence and visible passion (not to mention that voice), made him the clear choice. He was also one of the nicest contestants ever to appear on the show--even  notoriously grumpy Simon Cowell said so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Missouri's next superstar, David Cook. I wish you the best of luck in what I am sure will be a stellar career.</paragraph>
