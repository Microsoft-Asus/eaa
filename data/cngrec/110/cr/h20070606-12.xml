    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, the Supreme Court dealt a serious blow to women pursuing pay discrimination claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the majority of her 20-year career, Lilly Ledbetter was paid less than her male counterparts, including those with less seniority for doing the exact same work. By her own calculations, she was now being shortchanged by about $15,000 annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her experience is, unfortunately, a common one. In the Supreme Court decision, Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire, the Court ruled that she had missed her window of opportunity to file a claim covering the many years of discrimination she faced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to close this loophole by making every pay period a new infraction. This way, employees can challenge unfair practices that persist over time but don't come to light for years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inequality still exists. It is our job to fix it.</paragraph>
