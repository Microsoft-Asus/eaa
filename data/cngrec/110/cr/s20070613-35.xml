    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize Hayti, SD. The town of Hayti will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The county seat of Hamlin County, Hayti was founded in 1907 by the South Dakota Central Railway as a stop on its line from Sioux Falls to Watertown. The town was named after the area's common practice of tying hay for fuel. Hayti has been a successful and thriving community for the past 100 years and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and traditions for the next 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Hayti on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
