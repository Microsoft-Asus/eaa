    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to discuss the naturalization application backlog at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Agency, known as USCIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July 2007, the Bush administration raised the naturalization fee application by 66 percent, from $400 to $675. The fee increase was meant to improve the process of these applications. Yet, recent reports state that the USCIS is months behind in scheduling, so they aren't even beginning to process these applications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security estimates it will take 16 to 18 months to process these applications that have been filed by June 1, 2007. These delays are going to hinder hundreds of thousands of people from exercising their vote to be a part of history, the Presidential elections that are coming up in November. How abysmal this is for us to give that information to so many people who are playing by the rules, who are waiting in line to become U.S. citizens. These are people from across  the world waiting in line. We have to do something. I urge my colleagues to step up to the plate.</paragraph>
