    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week President Nambaryn Enkhbayar of Mongolia visited the United States to meet with President Bush and discuss the growing partnership between our two nations. As cochair of the Mongolian Caucus, I was grateful for President Enkhbayar's visit. Mongolia and the United States continue to work closely together to strengthen our economic and strategic alliances, as well as our efforts internationally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am particularly appreciative of the Mongolian people's continued support of our efforts in Iraq as the central front in the global war on terrorism. During the visit, President Bush and President Enkhbayar signed a Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact. A millennium challenge compact is an initiative by the United States to help developing nations expand their economic growth by investing in infrastructure, health care, education, transportation and other areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Happy birthday, Alan Stedman of Haddenfield, New Jersey.</paragraph>
