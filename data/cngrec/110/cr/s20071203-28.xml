  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DR. HIRAM WARD -- (Senate - December 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14698">S14698</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this Friday, on December 7 in Murfreesboro, AR, the citizens of Pike County will gather together to honor Dr. Hiram Ward as the "2007 Country Doctor of the Year." He is receiving the award for coming out of retirement and saving the Pike County Memorial Hospital from closure. The award is sponsored by Staff Care, a medical staffing firm in Irving, TX, and is presented annually "to physicians who best exemplify the spirit, skill, and dedication of America's medical  practitioners."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1953, Dr. Ward has served the citizens of Murfreesboro and Pike County as a devoted physician and caregiver. Nearly 9 years ago, Dr. Ward, who just recently turned 82, went into "semi-retirement," only seeing patients occasionally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, when Pike County Memorial Hospital faced closure due to the loss of its staff physicians, Dr. Ward came out of retirement and resumed work full time to keep the hospital open. For the last 11 months, Dr. Ward has served as the chief of staff for Pike County Memorial and has been on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. His work has kept the hospital, which is the second largest employer in town employing 55 people, from permanent closure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the people of southwest Arkansas, Dr. Ward has been a constant both at birth and death. He has delivered babies for most of the families in the area and also sat at the bedsides of many people's parents and grandparents at the hour of their passing. His handiwork as a physician is visible on the countless individuals that he "stitched up" over the course of his career. He has set limbs, removed gall stones, and simply improved the condition of his patients by just talking to them. He has  also saved many lives in Pike County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been the family doctor for my State director, Donna Kay Yeargan, nearly all of her life. She told me that Dr. Ward saved the life of her father, Jetty Steel, many times over beginning in 1963 when Mr. Steel suffered injuries from a serious car accident. Dr. Ward treated him in the emergency room before he was transported to another area hospital in Texarkana, AR. Years later, he discovered a heart problem in Mr. Steel and insisted that he receive a new heart valve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years after Donna Kay's mother died, Dr. Ward would travel 20 miles down an old country road to Nashville, AR, every Saturday night to visit with Jetty and give him a quick medical check. But it was at the end of Mr. Steel's life that Dr. Ward showed how much he cared about his patients. During the 3 weeks Mr. Steel was in the hospital before his death in March 2006, Dr. Ward came to the hospital at least twice a day to just sit and visit with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a quiet and thoughtful man of few words, but he maintains a commonsense approach to health and medicine that has made him among the most trusted men in the region. His patients are not just patients, they are his neighbors, his friends, his extended family. It is obvious that he does more than attend to their medical needs; he cares for them and loves them like family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Ward's life is medicine and keeping people healthy and active. He has always understood the value of treating the whole person. He gives each patient his undivided attention no matter how busy he is. There is a big difference between "medical attention" and "medical care." Perhaps the key to Dr. Ward's long and valuable service is that he understands that difference and that he really does care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most people would say that Dr. Ward has gone above and beyond the call of duty, but his friends doubt that he believes that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already this year, he has been featured in the July 2007 edition of "Reader's Digest" in the Grassroots column for his dedication to the people of Pike County and for coming out of retirement to keep the hospital open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, I congratulate Dr. Ward. The State of Arkansas is very proud of his achievements and happy that Dr. Ward is receiving this well-deserved recognition. Although Dr. Ward will take this in stride and quietly accept the accolades, his true reward comes from the work he has done and continues to do for his community.</paragraph>
