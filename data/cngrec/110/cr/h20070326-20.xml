    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to offer House Resolution 266, which honors the dedication and compassion of professional social workers. Our highest calling as humans is to provide service to others, especially those less fortunate than ourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the turn of the 20th century, thousands of people lived in despair and poverty, and it was the early progressive moment in which the social work movement was born, providing food, clothing, health care and education to the less fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social workers had a role in civil rights and in women's freedom. Today, social workers continue this fight to ensure that vulnerable families have the support and the health care that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social workers are everywhere in our society, caring for all of us. They help people in all stages of life, from children to the elderly, and in all situations, from adoption to hospice care. You can find social workers in hospitals, police departments, mental health clinics, military facilities and corporations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professional social workers are the Nation's largest providers of mental health care services. They provide  more mental health services than psychologists, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 600,000 people in the United States hold social work degrees. The Veterans Administration employs more than 4,400 social workers to assist veterans and their families with individual and family counseling, client education, end-of-life planning, substance abuse treatment, crisis intervention and other services.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 266. This resolution would recognize the important work of our Nation's social workers and support the goals and ideals of Professional Social Worker Month and World Social Worker Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social work is a profession for those with a strong desire to help improve people's lives and play a valuable role in the Nation's health care system. Social workers help people function the best way they can in their environment, deal with their relationships, and solve personal and family problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social workers often see clients who face life-threatening disease or social problems such as inadequate housing, unemployment, a serious illness, a disability, or substance abuse. Social workers also assist families that have serious domestic conflicts, sometimes involving a child or spousal abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, child, family and school social workers provide social services and assistance to improve the social and psychological functioning of children and their families and to maximize the family well-being and academic functioning of children. They assist single parents, arrange adoption, or help find foster homes for neglected, abandoned or abused children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In schools, they address problems such as teenage misbehavior and truancy and advise teachers on how they can cope with problem students. Social workers also specialize in services for senior citizens, running support groups for family caregivers or for the adult children of aging parents, advising elderly people or family members about choices in areas such as housing, transportation, and long-term care and coordination and monitoring of these services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through employee assistance programs, they may help workers cope with job-related pressures or with personal problems that affect the quality of their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Medical and public health social workers provide persons, families, and vulnerable populations with psychosocial support needed to cope with chronic, acute and terminal illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. They also assess and treat individuals with mental illness or substance abuse, including abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. They also may help plan for supportive services to ease patients' return into the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State of Tennessee, we have a long tradition of recognizing the vital role of social workers. In 2005, the Tennessee legislature, of which I was honored to serve as a member for many years, passed important legislation which required social workers to have received a B.S. or master's degree in social work from an accredited school, received a doctorate or Ph.D. in social work, or have a specialized certificate or license from the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a society, we have come to trust that the people using a certain title have completed specific training to prepare them for their work in assisting the public. Thanks to this legislation, Tennessee now ensures that positions requiring the skills and training of professional social workers are filled with fully qualified professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the East Tennessee State University Department of Social Work has a long and proud history of preparing the majority of social workers in the region that I represent. In addition to providing high-quality education to future social workers, the Department hosts a Social Work Career Day where students, community agencies and practitioners come together and share educational experience and information on a career in social work. Students and faculty are also involved in a number of  community based interdisciplinary learning and service activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the United States Department of Labor, the need for additional social workers is expected to increase faster than the average of all other occupations through the year 2014 due to the rapidly growing elderly population which is expected to create greater demand for health and social careers. The growth in social work is expected to occur most rapidly in home health care services, assisted living and senior living communities and the school setting. In addition, there is expected  to be a significant need for those social workers specializing in substance abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 50 percent of the United States population, age 15 to 54, report having at least one psychiatric disorder. Both severe and persistent mental disorders, including addictions, have profound consequences for individuals, their families and society, affecting their ability to learn, to grow into healthy adults and to nurture children, to work and secure housing and to engage in other routines of living. Recognizing the prevalence of mental disorders and the cost they exact on our society,  social workers provide more than 40 percent of all mental health services available to Americans, making them an integral part of our Nation's health care delivery system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we stand here to recognize the importance of our Nation's social workers and support the Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day. We also stand to encourage more young adults to seek out educational and professional opportunities as social workers where they can play a positive impact on changing people's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in highlighting the contributions of social workers and to support House Resolution 266.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Today we thank all those who have toiled in the fields of our community, including my maternal grandmother, who left the comfort of her home each day at the turn of the century and went to the Lower East Side to help immigrants. And we praise all of those who reach out to others every day in their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Social workers' service makes our communities stronger. March is National Professional Work Month, and Tuesday, March 27 is World Social Work Day. I honor their service and thank them for caring for all of us each day.</paragraph>
