    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the more than 1,200 students from across the country who will visit Washington, DC, to take part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, the most extensive educational program in the country developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to announce that the State of Oregon will be represented by Grant High School from Portland at this prestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Washington, the students will participate in a 3-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they "testify" before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. With many reports and surveys indicating the lack of civic knowledge and civic participation I am pleased to support such a superb program that is  producing an enlightened and engaged citizenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the names of these outstanding students from Grant High School are:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phoebe Anderson-Dana, Alex Barbour, Rachael Bortin, Rachael Bosworth, Andrew Carlson, Alma Chapa, Daniel Cruse, Casey Daline, Camille Faulkner, Rebecca Fischer, Laura Harris, Tiffany Harrison, Kristin Ivie, Mark Johnston, Madeline Jones, Jennifer Kemp, Sally Larkins, Sarah Lazzeroni, Julia Liedel, Benjamin MacCormack-Gelles, Edward Maisha, Zachary Mayer, Eamon McMahon, Asumi Ohgushi, Phung Phan, Stephanie Phoutrides, Hugh Runyun, Riley Scheid, Emily Schorr, Cassidy Slaughter-Mason, Annie Soga,  Jack Stephens, Annabelle Thomas, Annika Tohlen, and Kathleen Ward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend the teacher of the class, Mr. Geoff Henderson, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the national finals. Also worthy of special recognition is Ms. Marilyn Cover, the State coordinator, and Ms. Diane Thelen-Sager, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People program in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This group of students from Grant High School has brought pride to the State of Oregon, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them for their exceptional achievement.</paragraph>
