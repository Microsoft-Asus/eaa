  <chair> "(II) annually provide the Secretary with a statistically valid sample (that is approved by Secretary) of the children enrolled in such plans through reliance on such a finding by conducting a full Medicaid eligibility review of the children identified for such sample for purposes of determining an eligibility error rate (as described in clause (iv)) with respect to the enrollment of such children (and shall not include such children in any data or samples used for purposes of complying with  a Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) review or a payment error rate measurement (PERM) requirement);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(III) submit the error rate determined under subclause (II) to the Secretary;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(IV) if such error rate exceeds 3 percent for either of the first 2 fiscal years in which the State elects to apply this paragraph, demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary the specific corrective actions implemented by the State to improve upon such error rate; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(V) if such error rate exceeds 3 percent for any fiscal year in which the State elects to apply this paragraph, a reduction in the amount otherwise payable to the State under section 1903(a) for quarters for that fiscal year, equal to the total amount of erroneous excess payments determined for the fiscal year only with respect to the children included in the sample for the fiscal year that are in excess of a 3 percent error rate with respect to such children.</chair>
  <chair> "(ii) NO PUNITIVE ACTION BASED ON ERROR RATE.--The Secretary shall not apply the error rate derived from the sample under clause (i) to the entire population of children enrolled in the State Medicaid plan or the State CHIP plan through reliance on a finding made by an Express Lane agency, or to the population of children enrolled in such plans on the basis of the State's regular procedures for determining eligibility, or penalize the State on the basis of such error rate in any manner  other than the reduction of payments provided for under clause (i)(V).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(iii) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.--Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as relieving a State that elects to apply this paragraph from being subject to a penalty under section 1903(u), for payments made under the State Medicaid plan with respect to ineligible individuals and families that are determined to exceed the error rate permitted under that section (as determined without regard to the error rate determined under clause (i)(II)).</chair>
  <chair> "(iv) ERROR RATE DEFINED.--In this subparagraph, the term `error rate' means the rate of erroneous excess payments for medical assistance (as defined in section 1903(u)(1)(D)) for the period involved, except that such payments shall be limited to individuals for which eligibility determinations are made under this paragraph and except that in applying this paragraph under title XXI, there shall be substituted for references to provisions of this title corresponding provisions within  title XXI.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(F) EXPRESS LANE AGENCY.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) IN GENERAL.--In this paragraph, the term &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(I) is determined by the State Medicaid agency or the State CHIP agency (as applicable) to be capable of making the determinations of one or more eligibility requirements described in subparagraph (A)(i);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(II) is identified in the State Medicaid plan or the State CHIP plan; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(III) notifies the child's family--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(aa) of the information which shall be disclosed in accordance with this paragraph;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(bb) that the information disclosed will be used solely for purposes of determining eligibility for medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan or for child health assistance under the State CHIP plan; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(cc) that the family may elect to not have the information disclosed for such purposes; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(IV) enters into, or is subject to, an interagency agreement to limit the disclosure and use of the information disclosed.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) INCLUSION OF SPECIFIC PUBLIC AGENCIES.--Such term includes the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(I) A public agency that determines eligibility for assistance under any of the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(aa) The temporary assistance for needy families program funded under part A of title IV.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(bb) A State program funded under part D of title IV.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(cc) The State Medicaid plan.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(dd) The State CHIP plan.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ee) The Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ff) The Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq.).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(gg) The Richard B.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten years ago a Republican Congress and a Democratic President passed a landmark program to reach children who had fallen through the cracks of the health care system. These kids weren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, and their parents, most of whom worked, couldn't afford health insurance on their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today this program provides health care for 6 million children across the Nation. Those 6 million kids today are in jeopardy because this successful program will expire September 30. The legislation before us will continue helping these 6 million of our children and extend health care to 4 million more of our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is for parents like Ms. Molina, a mother of two children who worked two part-time jobs but still could not afford health insurance. CHIP got her kids treatment for dental work, two sprained ankles, one broken arm, and a severe burn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's for parents like Ms. Mingeldorff, the mother of a child born 25 weeks prematurely who would have had to turn down a job without health insurance because it would have made her ineligible for Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is for every child who needs a vaccination, a cavity filled, chemotherapy, insulin, antidepressants, or other life-sustaining health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for the children in your district and to remember this legislation will provide health care for 6 million who are now deriving that and 4 million more. The issue here is are you for or against health care for the kids under the SCHIP program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I reserve the balance of my time at this point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, this is almost an historic occasion because, like the President of the United States said, it is our intention to extend health care to cover 10 million kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't care how you cut it. You can call it socialized medicine. You can say it's outside of the budget. But when you go home, the question basically is going to be were you with the kids or were you not? It is not just the human and right thing to do, but from a fiscal point of view, how many billions of dollars do we save by providing preventative care to these youngsters? And certainly from a tax writer's point of view, how many of these kids are going to grow to be productive workers so  that they can pay taxes and make a contribution to this great Republic?</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I don't know how you're going to explain how the kids can go to emergency wards if they get ill, as the President of the United States has indicated; but I know one thing, those of us who have kids and grandkids want the very best for them, and we do have this occasion now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are a lot of complaints from the other side that they did not participate in the writing of this bill. Having been in the minority for so long, let me say that every one of you on the Republican side that did not participate, that complained, you have good cause. You were not involved. And I might heartily add, neither were Members on the Democratic side involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you really want to find out who called the shots on this bill, which is not the House bill, it's those people on the other side of the Capitol that believe that everything that has to pass the Senate, that you need 60 votes for. And that's the long and the short of it. So, you may call it the Democratic majority, as I once did, but they're being held hostage by the Republican minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I participated in terms of seeing what they wanted to do. And believe me, what they said to the House of Representatives, Republicans and Democrats alike, take it or leave it. And so if you want to join with me in looking for someone to criticize, after the debate we can meet in the lobby and talk about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you had an opportunity to vote for a better bill; it was here. And for those who are concerned that legal immigrants can't get services, I hope you voted for the House bill because it was in there. But if you really want to complain about it being un-American, walk with me to the other side, and we'll find the culprits who did it, and they're not Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the debate this evening should not be about who is for insurance for children and who is against health insurance for children. The fact is that all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, want SCHIP to be reauthorized. We will vote tomorrow, I believe, for a temporary extension of the program, and I predict that there will be a huge bipartisan vote in favor of extending the program to give this House more time to develop a true bipartisan reauthorization, long-term reauthorization  of the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do expect, Mr. Speaker, this bill to pass tonight, but I also expect the President to veto this bill, and I expect his veto to be sustained by this House. At that point, I'm very hopeful that, for the first time in this process, the minority in this House will be included in discussions about how we should reauthorize the SCHIP program, because to this point, frankly, we have not been included at all. We have not been asked for our recommendations for a reauthorization; we were not even given  a substitute when this matter came to the floor originally here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So perhaps after the President vetoes and we sustain the veto, then maybe we will be brought into the room and we will have a chance to discuss with the majority what we think is the appropriate level of reauthorization for funding for this program and perhaps some of our ideas with respect to limiting those eligible for this program to the universe of people who were originally intended to be helped by the program, that is, low-income children whose family incomes are too high to qualify for  Medicaid but too low to buy a policy in the individual market outside of the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, this evening I suggest that, rather than point fingers and say you're against kids and we're for kids, you're for tobacco, we're against tobacco, that we get through this debate and then get through the next step of the process, which I hope will be more bipartisan and more cooperative, to allow us to get a real reauthorization that we can all support as we did in the mid-1990s when we created this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we only got this bill, this so-called compromise, last night, so we've been diligently going through it all night and all day today. We're not sure of everything that's in this bill, but I can enumerate a number of things that we believe to be facts and I think are important in this debate for this particular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all is the matter of funding. This bill is not even close to being fully funded. Budget gimmicks are replete. The proposal assumes that funding will drop to about one-fourth of the funding in the year 2013, and then another $5 million cut after that. We all know that's not going to happen. But that was done, and I understand, just to make the budget numbers work; but Members ought to know what they're voting for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another thing that we're told by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of the House and the Senate, is that under this proposal 2 million children will move from private health insurance to government health insurance. Now, surely that's not what we want. We don't want the SCHIP program, do we, to move children from private insurance into government insurance? That wasn't the intent of this program when it started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And on the tax side, on the pay-for side, this bill proposes that we pay for a program with clearly growing requirements, growing needs with a funding source that is going to be declining, depleting, the tobacco tax. As you raise the tax on tobacco, you exacerbate the trend that has been evident in this country for a number of years of declining use of tobacco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to propose funding a growing program with a declining revenue source is, I would submit, irresponsible fiscal policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a few other speakers who are going to talk about some of the other weaknesses in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Pallone.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my chairman, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Rangel, Mr. Stark, and all who worked, including on the Senate side, to put this bill together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does pain me a great deal, though, to hear my Republican colleagues, and specifically the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, basically advocate for the President's veto of this legislation. And I say that because I know that 10 years ago, when we established the SCHIP program, it was bipartisan, President Clinton, Speaker Gingrich. And the fact of the matter is it was done for practical reasons because we knew there were kids, as was said by the gentleman from Louisiana, who were  not getting health care on the job, but whose incomes, because their parents were working, were too high to be eligible for Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, all we're doing today is being as practical as we were 10 years ago. We know that there are 6 million kids, almost twice who were enrolled in the program, who are eligible for this program under the same eligibility requirements as 10 years ago who are not enrolled in the program because we don't have enough money to pay for it and we haven't had enough outreach to get them enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing new here. This is the same block grant that Speaker Gingrich and President Clinton advocated 10 years ago. But practically speaking, we know that for the first time in the last 2 years the number of uninsured kids is now going up instead of going down, so we have to do something about it. And we sat down with the Republicans in the Senate, with the Democrats in the Senate and the Democrats here in the House, and we came up with a solution, which was the tobacco tax. Now, this  is fully funded. And the tobacco tax is a great way to pay for it because if you tax people who are smoking and they smoke less, then we have less health problems, and it's directly related to trying to provide health insurance. So don't tell me it's not paid for. It is paid for. It's paid for in a good way. There is no change in eligibility here. We are simply trying to cover the same kids that are eligible but not enrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if you go along with the President's veto of this legislation, what you're saying is that not only the kids that are not enrolled, but even those who are now in the program won't be able to get their health insurance. Shame on you for that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're debating the reauthorization of a bill that has been in place for 10 years. It would seem to me that, in doing so, we should learn from the mistakes that were made in the initial legislation and attempt to correct them. I believe the legislation before us tonight overlooks that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen the House version that passed here earlier, and we have now seen a Senate version; and the one before us tonight is very similar to the Senate version of this legislation. But it appears to me that we have some questions to ask about that. CBO says that there are 300,000 fewer uninsured low-income children who will be enrolled under the bill before us today than would have been enrolled under the original Senate bill, and yet the amount of money that is being spent is almost exactly  the same, an additional $35 billion over the next 5 years. When you couple that $35 billion with the baseline budgeting and the amount of money that States will have to put into the program, we find that we're going to be spending about $60 billion over the next 5 years for a program that for the first 10 years was only a $40 billion program. And when you do include that State funding into the mix, it will be $200 billion over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, who are we going to insure by putting this substantial amount of new money into the program? Once again, the Congressional Budget Office attempts to answer that question. They say that there will be an additional 800,000 children, currently SCHIP eligible, being enrolled in the program by the year 2012. And if that is truly the focus, which it should be the focus of the program, then what are we getting by spending an additional $60 billion? If you divide $60 billion by the additional 800,000  children, that means that this bill is going to require that we spend $74,000 per child. Now, I know the government can throw money away, but I believe that is certainly an excessive amount of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, who are these children that are going to be the new enrollees? Once again, CBO tells us that, of the additional children who are going to be potentially enrolled, that about half of them are children who already have private health insurance, a 50 percent crowd-out of the existing insurance market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, they also tell us that we ought to be concerned about the fact that if there are potentially going to be as many as 2 million children who will have been moved out of their private insurance into this government-subsidized program, we're also told that Medicaid and also SCHIP generally pay less than the private insurance market pays, that means that the health care providers, the doctors and the hospitals, are going to have to absorb another 2 million patients who are going to be reimbursing  them at a lower rate. Another error in the original program, it was for children, and yet we know that four States currently have more adults than children in their program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill before us, CBO estimates that in the next 5 years there will still be 780,000 adults enrolled in the Children's Health Care Program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume because I want to share a lot of complaints about what those Republicans did to a good, decent House bill. So if you want to join with me with your criticism, don't criticize anyone here. It is not my fault that your leaders were excluded from the so-called "conference." We had no conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know how it feels to have been in the minority, having been there for a decade. So I share with you why you were left out.

    <paragraph>I yield to the chairman of the Health Subcommittee. No one is in a better position to let you know that this is not the House bill. As hard as he worked to reform Medicare, to make certain that we preserved it, to reform that bill, to get $5 billion for the people in the rural areas, to help the aged poor, and really to help the doctors that work hard every day and deserve a decent reimbursement, that, my friends, was in the House bill.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as my distinguished chairman has suggested, this is a modest proposal, with all due respect to Mr. Swift. I am not proud of the bill or the process. I would say to my distinguished ranking member from the Ways and Means Committee that they were accorded every opportunity at every point to participate in this bill, and they know it. They were not excluded until they decided they did not want to help us pass the CHAMP bill, which was a far better bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, I have to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have helped us pass a bill that would have added a million additional children. It was a far better bill for children. It would have expanded coverage to legal immigrant children. It was better also for senior citizens. But I also have to thank our leadership and the commitment of Speaker Pelosi to suggest that when we come back, after, as we expect this bill will be vetoed, we will remember that there were a  tremendous number of proposals in here which would have helped not only children, but seniors, financial help for low-income seniors, mental health parity for Medicare, improved Medicare benefits and health benefits, preventive care, rural health parity, consumer protections in part D, improved dialysis procedures, protection of Medicare from privatization, and the preservation of the Medicare system by doing away with the excessive spending in Medicare Advantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The allegiance of groups like AARP, the AMA, Families USA, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve Medicare and Social Security, the AHA, all of whom helped us pass CHAMP, all have been ignored in the bill before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make it perfectly clear, I had no part in backing away from not only my commitments, the commitments of many of my colleagues, to these groups or to America's seniors. I know the Speaker will help us return to that commitment and pass those procedures in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues have made clear, this bill is far better than what President Bush prefers. It will provide $35 billion in new funds for the CHIP program, which will enable 6.6 million children to keep their health care at the end of the month and provide coverage to nearly 4 million currently uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush proclaims to want a "clean extension" of the CHIP program, but don't believe him on this any more than you did on weapons of mass destruction, "mission accomplished" or take your pick of lies he's told. He knows full well that his proposal would mean taking health care away from needy children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHIP program is a block grant so it provides a capped amount of funding to States each year. The existing program is broken. We've already had to pass legislation this year to provide additional funds to keep more than 13 States from dropping children from their CHIP roles. If the President has his way, those States will soon have to take away their health coverage anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I'll vote for this bill today. It is better than the status quo--and far better than the direction President Bush wants to take us all with regard to health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, I am not proud of this bill or this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 1st, we passed a far better bill through the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the Children's Health Insurance and Medicare Protection Act, CHAMP, was better for children. It invested $50 billion into the program and covered more than a million children. CHAMP also allowed States to use Federal funds to appropriately expand coverage to legal immigrant children and corrected a misguided regulation issued by the Bush administration on citizenship documentation that forced thousands of American children to lose their health coverage through Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, not only was the CHAMP Act better for children, it also provided overdue and much needed improvements to senior citizens and people with disabilities on Medicare. In the House, we combined children with seniors and created a bill that improved the health of our youngest and most needy and our oldest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Senate Republicans refused to allow our bills to go to conference. They refused to even consider attaching any Medicare provisions to the CHIP reauthorization. As a result, we are here today with a reduced CHIP package that cedes most of the House CHIP reauthorization bill to the Senate's preferred language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also not certain about whether we will really take up Medicare later this year and adopt the important Medicare improvements we passed in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of the following provisions from the CHAMP Act are now at risk: financial help for low-income seniors, Medicare mental health parity, improved Medicare preventive health benefits, prevention of the pending physician payment cuts, rural health parity, consumer protections in Part D, improved dialysis procedures, protection of Medicare from privatization through massive overpayments to private plans, and preservation of the Medicare system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my opinion, the allegiance of groups like AARP, the AMA, Families USA, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve Medicare, and Social Security and the AHA--which helped us pass CHAMP--have been ignored in the bill before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to close by making it perfectly clear that I had no part in backing away from my commitments to any Members of Congress, these groups, or to America's seniors in requesting your support for our broader CHAMP Act. I will do everything I can to see all sections of CHAMP become law. I urge my colleagues in the House and advocates across the country to urge leaders in both the House and the Senate to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill clearly isn't about helping low-income children. If it were, it would have support from both parties and the President would be eagerly waiting to sign it into law. This is a missed opportunity. Virtually everyone supports providing health insurance to low-income children. But when a Federal health program for children starts covering not only families, but childless adults making three and four times the poverty level, it has clearly lost its focus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that Democrats want taxpayers to fund, and the Federal Government to directly provide, health care benefits to millions of more Americans, even for those families making over $80,000 a year. They are using SCHIP as a vehicle and the children it is intended to cover as a shield to get one step closer to total Government control over our health care system. The current plan to expand SCHIP is in dire need of a second opinion. Instead of moving further and further away from the core  mission, we should be reforming the program to ensure it is truly helping America's uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office stipulates that the proposed expansion would cover an additional 5.8 million Americans at a cost of $35 billion. Alarmingly, more than one out of every three individuals already has private insurance. The bill before us does little more than move children and upper-income families from private insurance plans to taxpayer-funded  plans. That is a prescription for the type of government largess that stifles economies  and unduly burdens taxpayers. It is not a prescription for reducing the number of uninsured Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State's and children's advocates should take a second look at this bill. Because of shoddy funding sources, this bill is likely to harm more States and health care programs than it helps. A Heritage Foundation study showed that as many as 28 States, including Michigan, stand to have a net loss of $10 to $700 million in revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is designed poorly, funded poorly, and will do little to help lower-income Americans obtain health coverage. The President should veto this bill. Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion, as we did nearly 10 years ago when the program was created, to make certain that children in America have access to a health care system.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of health care for America's poor and near-poor children. I also rise in equally strong opposition to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than a decade, I have introduced into the United States Congress every single year a bill that would give every single child covered by this bill health insurance. Indeed, it would provide to every family covered by this bill a source of money, tax funds, to them and their family, to buy the health insurance they need for them and their children. But make no mistake about it. This bill is a fraud. The American people are smart. They know it is a fraud. This bill is Congress playing fast  and loose with the facts. If we are going to have a debate about covering every single American, let's have that debate. But let's not hide it in a debate about children's health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people are generous to a fault. They want to cover poor children. They want to cover children who are uninsured. The SCHIP program we have was supposed to do just that. But this program is a fraud. It doesn't cover just poor and near-poor. It covers middle-class families. Some will say, "Oh, it is capped at 300 percent of the Federal poverty level." But under the law and the language in the bill, States can define income any way they want. Therefore, there is no cap on income.  It doesn't just cover uninsured children. It covers more children who are insured already than those who are uninsured. CBO says that if we pass this bill, 2 million children currently covered by insurance, getting better coverage than they will get under this bill, will lose that coverage and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if we want to have a debate about universal care, I am for that debate. I have got that bill. But don't have a bill that is a fraud. We must be honest in this debate. This bill will hurt children's health care in America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to give 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood). I cannot think of a Member of this House that has worked harder in trying to bring civility, no matter what the issue was. I heard he wasn't going to run for reelection.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a bill about children and about health care. Now, all of us in this Chamber have the very best health care insurance in the world, bar none. We should be willing to share those kinds of resources with kids in this country. Why should children have to go to an emergency room when they have the flu? Why should children have to go to an emergency room when they have a cold? Why should children have to go to emergency rooms when they are sick? They shouldn't.  Not in America. Not where we have the very best health care in the world. My friends, we should give to our children the access to health care that we have, those of us that serve in the House and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bipartisan compromise. This is an opportunity to take a Republican initiative, share it, move on and give the opportunity to children. I encourage Members to do that, to play on the Republican initiative that was started years ago and to say, we have a bipartisan opportunity to give good health care to children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, particularly on the Republican side, to vote for this proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The debate about whether or not to reauthorize and expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program should be easy. This legislation is the product of a bipartisan group that worked to produce a compromise that should be acceptable to all of us. With the shortfall we have seen in several states over the past year, reauthorization of the program at current funding levels is unacceptable. Earlier this year, Illinois faced a $247 million SCHIP shortfall. Many other states were a similar situation  before the shortfalls were addressed with new appropriations. By passing this bill today, we may be able to prevent future shortfalls which jeopardize those state programs designed to cover the costs for low income families who can't afford adequate health insurance for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the estimated six million low-income children who are not eligible for Medicaid, more than 250,000 children were covered by All Kids, Illinois' successful children's insurance program. More than half of those children live in working and middle class families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. In 2005, more than 25% of all uninsured children in Illinois fell into the $25,000-$35,000 income level range, having nearly doubled from 13% in 2002. At that  rate of growth, we must continue to see this program through. With passage of this legislation today, it is estimated that an additional 154,000 Illinois children will be afforded health insurance. An additional 3.8 million children nationwide will be covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation. It is imperative that we continue to look out for the future health and well-being of this Nation, and that starts with our children today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I recognize our next speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman that children ought not have to go to emergency rooms to get care,  that children ought to be able to go to their family doctor; but there's a good way and a not-so-good way to provide that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides a government healthcare program for that. We would much rather provide a private health insurance plan for that. I would submit that there is a vast difference in those approaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), a member of the Ways and Means Committee and ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this bill today, but I have got to make it clear that I do support children's health insurance. I believe this bill flat misses the mark. While well-intentioned, this legislation is a massive expansion of a government-run healthcare program that takes resources away from the very children it was meant to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee on Ways and Means, I am deeply disturbed by the part of this bill that makes it easier for illegal immigrants to be covered under this program. In the last Congress, Republicans worked hard to ensure that everyone in this children's health program are really U.S. citizens. Because of that effort, States now require applicants to show documents like birth certificates, driver's licenses or passports in order to prove U.S. citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This new legislation weakens this standard. All applicants would simply be asked to provide a Social Security number and a name that would then be verified by the Social Security Administration. This process is ripe for massive fraud and abuse that will leave American tax dollars paying for healthcare for illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we have the responsibility here in Congress to spend the taxpayer dollar wisely. I know my constituents don't want the Federal Government doling out billions of dollars to pay for illegal immigrants' health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should just pass a responsible extension of this important program before it expires, not play politics with our kids' health care. Americans deserve, want, and need for our children to have good health care, and we need to do it today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1 minute to my friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), a real expert in the field of health care and a caring and concerned practitioner as a nurse. We are grateful that she is with us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairman Dingell, for your leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill and in support of America's children. We have two choices today: we can vote for this excellent bipartisan bill, which Senator Hatch appropriately called "an honest compromise which improves a program that works," or we can vote against this bill and not only deny millions of children the chance to finally access health care, but strip it away from children who are already covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trust me: as a nurse, I know the power and prudence of providing this health care coverage for our kids. It is indeed an accomplishment that Congress can be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is responsible, and it's the right thing to do. Make no mistake, it is a compromise bill. But if we fail to pass this bill and even one child loses health coverage, we have failed our most important constituents, our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. Vote "yes" to protect children's health. "Suffer the little children."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have spent most of today actually trying to read the bill. I have the bill in front of me. In this 2-minute period, I want to discuss section 605 of the bill. Section 605 of the bill has the title: "No Federal funding for illegal aliens." It is a very brief section, two lines: "Nothing in this act allows Federal payment for individuals who are not legal residents." That is it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the title of section 605 would have you believe there's going to be no Federal funding for illegal aliens. When you specifically read the section, it just says nothing in the act allows payment. It doesn't prohibit it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if the authors of section 605 really don't want illegal aliens to receive funding under this bill, this section ought to read something like this: "This act prohibits Federal payments for individuals who are not legal residents or citizens."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent to substitute the language that I just read: "This act prohibits Federal payments for individuals who are not legal residents or citizens."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I agree we have excessive spending. In Iraq. For 41 days of the war in Iraq, 10 million U.S. children would get health care; 41 days of the war in Iraq, where we have been at war for over 4 1/2  years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistakes, this debate is not about spending. It is about priorities.

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a couple of things: number one, we are not dedicating enough time to this debate. A half-hour is not enough time to debate what this is really all about. This is not just about health care, health insurance for low-income children. If that is all this was about, then we could pass this with 2 minutes of debate, unanimous consent, voice vote, everyone would agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not what this debate is about. This debate goes far beyond that, and the American people deserve to have a much more honest, much more thorough debate about what really is being discussed here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a misleading bill. This is a misleading debate. This is misleading, number one, because this is really all about whether or not the Federal Government should run health care for most Americans or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us in this room, Republicans and Democrats, believe that Americans ought to have access to affordable health insurance. All Americans. We all believe that. The question is, should the government run it, or should health care be a decision between patients and their doctors? Let's have a debate about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason this is a misleading debate is because this bill takes more health insurance away from children with private insurance than it gives to children without insurance. We are taking more people off of private insurance than we are giving to uninsured children. If we wanted to just give uninsured children health insurance, let's do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is misleading because it gives children health insurance for 5 years, and then it pushes them off a cliff. I call it the majority's "bait and switch SCHIP funding." It says 5 million children get it now; 5 million children 6 months into 2012 get nothing. $41 billion is hidden out of this bill. Who believes that that is going to happen? In order to contort their way into their PAYGO rule, they are giving on the one hand and taking out with the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what this debate is really about is putting the government in the middle of that decision between the patient and their doctor. I don't want a bureaucrat running health care. I don't want an HMO bureaucrat running health care, and I don't want a government bureaucrat running health care. I want patients running health care with their doctors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this debate is really about. This debate is about getting more and more and more government in the middle of the health care decisions between patients and their doctors. This is a debate about getting us on that path toward government-run health care. That is a big debate. It deserves more than a half-hour of debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, unfortunately, the majority is misleading the American people by saying this is only about low-income children, when they are bringing us a bill that displaces kids off of private health insurance, goes to virtually to anybody of any income if a State wants to, and goes way beyond the idea of insuring low-income children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's give low-income children health insurance, and let's have a big debate on whether the government ought to be running health care in America or not.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would observe an interesting point, and that is the Congressional Budget Office says that we are taking care of 4 million additional kids who are identical in all particulars to those we now care for under SCHIP.

It hopefully will not be dropped off, and we can continue to expand the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell you that I do have differences with our party, and especially the Republican Senate Members that refused to allow for coverage of legal permanent resident children and pregnant women.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise to oppose this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As much as anything, I want to say the children's health care bill, you would think would get a little more dignity in the process around here. This is a 299-page bill which we received, "we," minority Republicans, received at 6 p.m. last night, or maybe even later than that. That doesn't give you a lot of time to work on a bill and have any kind of bipartisan deliberations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plus, there is no motion to recommit. Now I know that is inside-the-Beltway stuff, but this is important if you are talking children's health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I do know is that in the bill, adults are still allowed to be covered by it. Adults can push poor children out of the way because States are going to politically favor them and let them have the opportunity to be insured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there is a massive tax increase. I know there is very little sympathy for smokers these days, but it is still a tax increase on the backs of the smokers. And in order to get enough money to pay for this, it would require 22 million new smokers in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, maybe the Democrat Party is planning to pass out cigarettes at the schools and say to the kids: Hey, look, start smoking so you can finance your own insurance company. And you'll probably be needing it, by the way, wink-wink. But in the meantime, the government gets to grow. The bureaucracy gets to grow. The nanny-state, more like the Nurse Ratchet states, continues to grow at the expense of children. I urge a "no" vote on this.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400186" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>. In Oregon alone, 37,000 new children will receive access to health care under this bill. Those children are counting on us to act today before this critical program expires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although many speakers before me have focused on the big picture by citing the number of children impacted by this legislation, I implore my colleagues to not lose sight of the small picture: the impact SCHIP has on the life of a single child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The core purpose of this legislation is to ensure that a single child with the flu can go to the doctor or that a single child with cancer can receive chemotherapy. SCHIP simply allows the interaction between health care providers and the child to occur millions of times over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the House will put aside petty partisan differences and show strong bipartisan support for <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, that the President will stand alone if he vetoes this critical piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can give the President 10 million reasons why he should put down his veto pen once we pass this bill, <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>: the 10 million children who will otherwise go without access to health care if we do not pass this bill.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to this SCHIP proposal. I see this as a bad deal for America, which is not to say that I oppose a reauthorization of this program or its essential elements. And in the continuing resolution this week, we will see to it that this program does not lapse as a virtue of my vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But beyond the budget gimmickry, beyond increasing taxpayer liability for illegal immigrants, this compromise is no deal the American people should accept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting that a health insurance program for poor kids doesn't require your kids to be poor. Families with incomes of up to $83,000 a year could be entitled to assistance in health insurance in this program. Also, a State program to provide health insurance for children doesn't require families to have children to participate. This program allows childless adults to continue to receive SCHIP through 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, it pays for all of this by raising taxes 61 cents per pack and more on cigars. The headline ought to read, "Smokers in America to pay for middle class welfare."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should reject this SCHIP program, continue this program, and reject all of the bad elements of this bad deal.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to Mr. Jason Altmire, a distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of conversation about how this is a Federal Government program and how this is a move to expand Government's role in health care, so I thought I would take a moment, a minute, to talk about what is really in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an expansion of an existing program created 10 years ago in a Republican Congress. It is a capped block grant. The amount of money is capped. It flows through the States, and almost every State in the country administers the program through the private health insurance market. Through the private market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This could not be anything further from a big, government-run program. It is administered by the States and contracted out to the private market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yes, these are families that have income. They are families that work hard and play by the rules, and they are families that can't afford health care for their children. Is there any better cause in this country that we can work on in this Congress than that issue? I ask my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since we have not had a markup and since we have not had a legislative hearing, and I know it is cumbersome to actually refer to specific sections of the bill on the floor, especially of what is portrayed to be a conference report, which this is not, which is not amendable, but I want to go back and talk about this eligibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a section in the bill, section 203: "State option to rely on findings from an express lane agency to conduct simplified eligibility determinations." On the face of it, that would seem to be a good thing. This section is very complicated. It is 10 to 15 pages long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it does say in this section that a parent of a child that might be eligible can self-verify. If you are approached by one of these express lane agencies, it is up to the parent of the child to self-determine, to self-certify that they are indeed eligible. That would appear to be something that we need to work on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then it goes on when it defines the actual express lane agencies on page 123 of the bill, in subparagraph (F), it goes through and lists the kind of public agencies that are express lane agencies. They apparently include Medicare part D, Medicaid, Food Stamp Act, Head Start Act, National School Lunch Act, Child Nutrition Act, Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, United States Housing Act, Native American Housing Assistance Act, and so on and so on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again on the face of it, those are all agencies that might be of some assistance, but I doubt that their requirements are the same as the requirements for the base bill for SCHIP in  terms of income eligibility and age determination. For example, I doubt that the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act has an age requirement at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So again, when the President vetoes this bill and we are back working together on a bipartisan basis, these are the kinds of things I hope to clarify and tighten up.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>When the House first passed its version of this bill, I opposed it, particularly because it funded that House version of the bill through reductions in Medicare spending. This bill is a compromise. It is a much better bill. It's not a great bill, but it's a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was a cabinet secretary in New Mexico for children at the time SCHIP was initially implemented. It was established by a Republican Congress and a Democrat President and it works. It gets kids health insurance that they need.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let nobody make a mistake about it. I know the Democrats are trying to cast this as a debate about insuring poor children. That's false. We have Medicaid. We could reauthorize the current SCHIP program now in the snap of a finger, but that's not what this is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, this is a debate about who will control health care in America. Will it be families and doctors, or will it be government bureaucrats? This is a proxy fight for the Democrats to take that first step towards socialized, government-run health care in America. That's what this is all about, and there should be no mistake about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've got a program for children that insures adults. We've got a program ostensibly to help the poor that can subsidize people making $82,000 a year, and they're going to do all this with a huge tax increase on smokers, and we're going to need 22 million new smokers in 10 years just to pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this bill passes not today not tomorrow but at some time, the children of America will suffer. If this program passes, and I hope all the mothers of America are paying very careful attention to this, because if this passes, in the years to come they won't wait minutes or hours to see a doctor of their choice. They will wait weeks and months to see a doctor chosen by a government bureaucrat, and that doctor will not be the doctor of today. It will be somebody who is less competent, less able  to take care of their child, and that's what this is all about.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have here before us a bill which gives $35 billion to strengthen and improve children's health coverage. It protects 6 million children today covered by SCHIP. It adds an additional 4 million. It is the largest investment in children's health since the passage of the original Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides $300 million in outreach grants for the States, community organizations, tribal organizations, and national initiatives. It provides a new express lane initiative for one-stop enrollment. It facilitates enrollments for newborns so coverage starts immediately. It does more than this. It revises the current SCHIP program formula to more accurately attract State need in that it follows the House provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides the children enrollment program contingencies adjustment allotments to States to succeed in reaching the eligible but the unenrolled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does more. It provides dental coverage for CHIP children. It also provides mental health coverage for children. It provides grant money for diabetes clarification and prevention. It clarifies the coverage of school-based clinic services through the CHIP program. It creates a new option for CHIP programs to subsidize employer options and employer coverage for children whose parents may already have access to coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It does not do any of the things that were charged on the other side because it does not change the law that CHIP now has in place. It just offers additional benefits to children under the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a program which will cover 4 million more kids. It has to be passed by the first of the next month or else all of these kids are going to lose their coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was at the Governors' meeting in northern Michigan, and the one thing that the Governors were unanimous on is that we need to pass this SCHIP because it is an essential program and an essential part of their program for the care of our kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a piece of legislation that will make this country better. Take care of our kids. See to it that we do the job that we should in making health care available for all of our kids.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe all of the controllers of time are ready to close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the gentleman that spoke right before me, the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said that this bill provides $35 billion for children. This bill actually provides a lot more than that. It's $35 billion in new, additional spending on top of the $25 billion that the program as currently structured spends. So we're more than doubling on paper the cost of this program. And when you consider that there's another, oh, approximately $30 billion that the tax increase  in this bill does not cover, we're getting up to tripling, quadrupling the size of this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the gentleman earlier said that no abuses such as illegal immigrants gaining benefits have ever been identified. Well, I would refer the gentleman to the 2005 HHS Inspector General report in which the Inspector General says that 47 States allowed self-declaration in the United States citizenship for Medicaid and he asked for those States to give him an audit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only one State did that, the State of Oregon. The Secretary of State provided an audit, and in that audit he found out of 812 individuals sampled, who were Medicaid beneficiaries in that State, 25 of them were noneligible noncitizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, under the provisions in this bill, which liberalize the current law treatment of qualification of individuals for this program, we indeed expect to see abuses of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of us to vote "no" on this so that we can sustain the President's veto if the bill passes and then get together for a true bipartisan compromise on this important program.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the distinguished chairman for recalling to mind that opening day here when I accepted the gavel on behalf of the children of America, all of the children of America. And when we had this debate before in Congress, we talked about perhaps the children listening to this debate, hearing what Members of Congress were saying. And I expressed my hope that they would consider this the children's Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, for his leadership, and Mr. Stark, the Chair of the Health Subcommittee for helping to make this the children's Congress with this legislation. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee for his tremendous leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Rangel and Mr. Dingell went into the conversations with the Republican leadership in the Senate on this bill, true champions of America's children, knowing the facts and figures, the provisions, every provision of the bill with such authority as they argued on behalf of America's children so effectively that this legislation before us reflects many of the provisions that were in the House bill. We had to agree to the Senate language in terms of the $35 billion and the pay-for  with the tax on tobacco. We had hoped that we could do more in terms of the money allocated for this purpose so that we could cover more children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I praise Mr. Dingell, I also want to acknowledge the fabulous leadership of Mr. Pallone, Chairman PALLONE of the Subcommittee on Health in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Because of their leadership, we were able to join Senator Reid, Chairman Baucus, Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member GRASSLEY, and Ranking Member HATCH in having a very bipartisan conversation on this subject. The people who were in the room that evening  cared about passing a serious piece of legislation to expand health care for America's children. Not to expand the eligibility, as some on the other side of this House would have you believe, but to expand the number of kids who could be served if they met the eligibility. I, myself, had hoped that we could go beyond that and have eligible children in America who were legal immigrants. I was told that that would not fly in the Senate; that is a fight we will hold for another day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I am pleased as one who represents a minority majority district  from a majority minority State, where our State is blessed with a beautiful diversity, that of the additional children, nearly 4 million additional children covered, 67 percent of those children are minority children. Two-thirds of those children are children from families who are working hard, playing by the rules, lifting themselves out of poverty. They are the working poor in America.  They are those who have aspired to the middle class to change that status and want to stay there. They simply don't make enough money to afford the private health insurance that this SCHIP initiative enables them to do. In fact, 72 percent, my colleagues might be interested to know that 72 percent of the children on this SCHIP program get their health coverage from private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many misrepresentations, and I think they are probably unwitting because I assume that every person in this Congress cares about insuring as many children in our country as possible. How could it not be so? It is a deeply held value in our country that our children, as President Kennedy said, are our greatest resource and our best hope for the future. We must invest in them. We have a moral responsibility to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we had the debate on this bill and it first came to the floor, I was delighted in quoting a poem from my youth from Longfellow when he said, "Between the dark and the daylight, when the night is beginning to lower, comes a pause in the day's occupation that is known as the children's hour." This is the children's hour for us in the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I quoted Longfellow then, I am reminded of the Bible tonight, and I speak with all of the sincerity and all of the hope to President Bush in the hope that he will change his mind to dig deeply into his heart and think about the children in America who don't have health care. Because, if not, I think that the President is giving new meaning to the words "suffer, little children." Suffer, little children, if your parents can't afford health insurance, but they are working hard and they are not  on Medicaid, but you will suffer because they are struggling to give you the best possible future. Suffer, little children, if your family has played by the rules and they have come to this country and you are here as a legal immigrant, because if you are sick, you will not get health care unless your parents can afford private</paragraph>
    <paragraph>is just not right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would hope that the President would have had a change of heart and mind since he was Governor of Texas. When he was Governor of Texas, the SCHIP program there, in meeting the needs of the children of Texas, ranked 49th in the country; 49th in the country. Forty-eight States were doing better in meeting the health needs of their children as reflected in the outreach of the SCHIP program. Does that mean that Texas is the 49th wealthiest State in the Union, that the children in that State can  all afford private health care? I don't think so, especially since that State, as with mine, is blessed with beautiful diversity and people, again, families who come to America, families who are part of our country, who are struggling to make ends meet to build a better future for their children. And building that better future is what our country is all about, and those newcomers make America more American. I heard the President say that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also heard him say that in this term of office that he would enroll every child who is eligible. I am sure our distinguished majority leader will bring that to the attention of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is interesting about this is that the President, if he persists in vetoing this bill, and by the way, you don't have to be a Latin scholar to know that "veto" means "I forbid." With that pen, the President says, I forbid struggling families in America to have health care for their children. I forbid every child to be treated the same if they have an ailment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How did any one of us decide that we were going to choose, you will have health care and you will not, in a country as great as ours when we are talking about our children? We are talking about our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that is why the Conference of Mayors, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, a bipartisan organization, has overwhelmingly supported this legislation. That is why 43 Governors sent us a letter in July urging us to come to bipartisan agreement on legislation that would reauthorize SCHIP to care for many more children in our country. So when I hear the President say that we don't want to help children, we just want to do politics, I don't think he means that. So I hope he doesn't mean that he is going  to veto the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Grassley said of the President: The President's understanding of our bill is wrong. I urge him to reconsider his veto message based on our bill, not something that someone on his staff told him wrongly is in the bill. Actually, he said, "in my bill," Senator Grassley said. And Senator Hatch said: We are talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President has some pretty bad advice on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to also commend Representative Ray LaHood and join you, Mr. Chairman, in saying what a privilege it is to call him "colleague" and to serve with him in the Congress, and thank him for his leadership in making a distinction between what is about the children and what is about politics in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked about the mayors; I talked about the Governors. Nearly 300 organizations in our country, alphabetically from AARP to YMCA and everything alphabetically in between, Families USA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard someone say the doctors should be making the decisions. The American Medical Association firmly supports this bill. The President of the AMA stood with us in a press conference today to support this legislation. The Society of Pediatrics. Everyone who has anything to do or cares about children in our country knows that this bill is the way to go. It is not everything I want, believe me, it is not the bill I would have written. I would have been far more generous and it would have been  paid for in perhaps a different way, but it would have been paid for; because in terms of bringing benefits to our children, we have absolutely no intention of heaping debt onto them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Catholic Hospitals Association, again, the list goes on and on about who supports this bill. It is a long list; it is a comprehensive list. And I might include in it that, across the country, overwhelmingly, the American people know and respect the value of taking care of America's children, all of America's children. Two-thirds, two-thirds of those polled among Republican voters, 2-1, they support passing this legislation and having it signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why does the President want to isolate himself from caring for America's children? Let's hope and let's pray that a very big, strong bipartisan vote tonight will send him a message to rethink his position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see a child in the Chamber. Our constant inspiration of what we do here is supposed to be about the future, and the future demands that we invest in health, the education, and the well-being of our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, my colleagues, vote as if the children are watching. Please vote as if the children are watching, and please send them a message that this is the children's Congress.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>And since I really have a real minute and a half, I'm going to try to go through this as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans want to reauthorize the SCHIP program. We do want to refocus it on the original intent of the program, which was near-low-income children in families between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. We understand that  in the 10 years of the program's existence that waivers have been given and there are some States that cover up to 350 percent of poverty, and some States cover adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as our distinguished Speaker just said, Republicans are for the children, and we want to focus the SCHIP funds on those children and those families that don't have private insurance and aren't covered by Medicaid; and we believe that that is children in families somewhere between 100 percent of poverty and 200 percent of poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when the President rightfully vetoes this bill, and when the House of Representatives rightfully sustains the President's veto, it is my hope that we will get with the other body and the Democratic leadership at the leadership level and Chairman Dingell and Chairman Rangel, and we will work out a bipartisan compromise that does cover the health care needs of the needy children of America that currently, in spite of our best efforts, do not have the health insurance and the  health coverage that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make that possible, we have to defeat this bill, or at least get enough votes to sustain the President's veto of this bill, and then work together in the near future to do some of the things that we have talked about on the floor this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote "no" on the SCHIP bill this evening.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to the distinguished majority leader the balance of my time for purposes of closing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for those of us who have served in this body for some period of time, all of us know that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) has been as focused on health care for all Americans as anybody who's served in this body, with the sole exception, perhaps, of his father. For over half a century, the Dingells have focused on making sure that Americans in the richest land on the face of the Earth had access to health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate my friend, Mr. Dingell, and I want to congratulate his partner, Charlie Rangel, one of the senior Members of this House, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who has worked collaboratively with Jim McCrery, and I want to congratulate Jim McCrery; I'll congratulate him again while he's listening; who has worked, I think, positively with the chairman, and I thank him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this legislation. Today the Members of this body must answer this fundamental question: Will you stand with millions of American children who, through no fault of their own, but they live in families of limited means, have no health insurance? Or will you stand with the few, including at least now President Bush, although I hope he changes his mind, who are ideologically opposed to this legislation, and thus being willing to leave millions of American children stranded without  the health insurance coverage they need and that they deserve?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this: we must not sacrifice the health of our children on the altar of a conservative ideology. We must pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, President Bush himself stated on the campaign trail in 2004, in fact, it was at the Republican Convention, and I would hope all my Republican colleagues would listen to the President's quote, if you haven't already seen it and read it. He said this as he addressed the American people asking them for their vote for a second term, which they gave him. He said this: "In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for  government health insurance programs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush said that as he appealed to the American public for their support for a second term, that he would aggressively pursue a program of adding millions of children, eligible but not included, in the health insurance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need." That is what President Bush said to the American public from the convention floor in 2004. We, tonight, are going to give him the opportunity to fulfill that promise to the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the President is threatening to renege on his campaign promise and to veto this legislation. Let's be clear: this fiscally responsible legislation will ensure that some 10 million children will receive health insurance coverage. That's approximately 4 million more than are covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program today. And so what we consider today is not young Master Snyder, who was on this floor, or Gemma Frost, with whom we met earlier today. Gemma Frost will be  covered. Luckily, Master Snyder's father is covered, as all of us are, under a Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan to which our employer contributes. Gemma Frost was not so lucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, those 4 million additional children are eligible under existing guidelines, not new guidelines that we've created. They are the children that were eligible that President Bush talked about in 2004 that he wanted to vigorously assume inclusion in the program. Millions, he referred to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation does not change eligibility guidelines. It simply strengthens CHIP's financing, increases coverage for low-income children, and improves the quality of care they will receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In contrast, under the President's proposal, and I hope my friends would put this fact in juxtaposition to the President's representation in 2004 on the floor of the national convention that you held as your party, his proposal would decrease, by 800,000 children, the numbers that would be covered under CHIP in the future. Now, that's included in the 4 million, so actually it's a net 4 million difference between the proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, we ought not to retreat from our children's health. We ought not to retreat from working families concerned about the inclusion of their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I suggest to my friends concerned about cost, we ought not to give the answer, they can go to the emergency room. Why not? Because all of us know that is the most expensive intervention in the health care system in America. And so not only do we put our children at risk, but we compound our costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's no wonder, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation has received strong support from Members of both sides of the aisle, as well as a wide range of health care providers, including private insurers, doctors and hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, Senator Hatch has already been quoted, but it bears repeating. He said: "We're talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President had some pretty bad advice on this."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don't take that bad advice. Let us join hands; let us be together on this issue. You voted on a prescription drug program far more expensive than this one, and unpaid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Grassley stated: "The President's understanding of our bill is wrong."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the former chairman of the Finance Committee, Republican, senior Member of the United States Senate. He says, "The President's wrong." He urges him, he says, "I urge him to reconsider his veto message."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every one of us, as we vote tonight, can send a strong message that will perhaps help him to reconsider that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me say, those who complain that this bill will induce people with private insurance to drop their coverage and enroll in the CHIP program are simply grasping at straws. Why do I say that? The fact is, even America's health insurance lobbying group supports this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me mention two other points. First, I am very pleased that this legislation includes a comprehensive dental benefit that will give low-income children the dental care they need and will provide States with flexibility in how they provide such care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do I bring that up?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dental care is important. A 12-year-old child who lived approximately 8 miles from this Chamber, Deamonte Driver was his name, he was 12 years of age. He had three siblings. He got a toothache. His mother did not have coverage and tried to get coverage, tried to get dental care, and she could not get dental care, and that toothache became an infection in the brain, and Deamonte Driver died just months ago, just 9 or 10 miles from where we stand. That is one of the reasons, one of the  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H10881]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I'm very disappointed that the Senate Republicans insisted that we remove the House-passed provision on Medicare, as well as our provision that would have allowed legal immigrants who pay taxes to be eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is that of concern?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because my granddaughter, 5 years of age, who just started kindergarten, she may sit next to one of those children in her kindergarten class, and that child who is legally in the United States may get sick. But if that child cannot access health care and sits next to my granddaughter, my granddaughter is at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want everybody in this country to be healthy so that the rest of us can be assured that we operate in a healthy environment. That is why we want that provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen of this House, Speaker Pelosi was right: I don't believe there's a person in this House that doesn't care about their own children, about their neighbor's children, and about the children of our country. All of us care. We need to come together, however, and see how that care can be transformed into meaningful, tangible help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have a rare and wonderful opportunity tonight to do the right thing, to put aside partisanship, to elevate the practical, responsible, and moral solution above the ideological.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's seize this opportunity. Let's do the right thing. Let's stand with America's children. Let us pass this historic legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412200" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe our nation must show true compassion for the most vulnerable among us, and CHIP is a program that helps millions of low-income American children to receive health care so they can grow up in good health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its creation in 1997, CHIP has been successful in providing vital health care coverage for children in families who cannot afford private insurance yet earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are now 6.6 million children emolled in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless we act now, they are in danger of losing their health coverage, as CHIP expires on September 30th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leaders in the House and Senate have worked hard to bring this conference bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In supporting the conference bill, I want to note that the bill passed by the House earlier is a stronger bill in its coverage of more children in need and in eliminating the automatic cuts to Medicare reimbursements set to take effect in 2008 and 2009. Eliminating these automatic cuts was at the top of the list of needed legislation by medical and health care groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that we will address their concerns through another bill before the cuts go into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also deeply disappointed that Senate Republicans insisted on the removal of provisions providing coverage for the children of legal immigrants. Such discrimination based on immigrant status should have no place in a bill providing health care to children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While work remains to be done, I also want to point out that under this bill we would preserve the coverage of more than 20,000 children in Hawai`i, and in addition 12,000 children in Hawai`i who currently are uninsured would gain coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would preserve coverage for the 6.6 million children nationwide currently covered by CHIP and extend coverage to an additional 3.8 million children who are eligible for coverage but not enrolled. Thus passing this bill would provide health care coverage for more than 10 million American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A new report by Families USA indicates that during a 2-year period almost 35 percent of Americans under age 65 lacked healthcare insurance. Hawai'i is better than average in this regard, but 29 percent of our state's residents under age 65 still lacked insurance at some point during the past 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support providing all Americans with high quality, affordable health care, and I hope that Congress will continue to move in that direction. But until we reach that goal, we should take steps that help our most vulnerable populations, including low-income children. This is precisely the group that CHIP will help, if we can get it reauthorized and signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support CHIP because it is the compassionate, just, moral and the right thing to do. In fact, it is also highly cost-effective. It costs less than $3.50 a day to cover a child through CHIP. It would be far more expensive for taxpayers to leave these children uninsured and having to pick up the tab for indigent care in emergency rooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. While the bill is not as strong as the House passed version, it has several good provisions that deserve our support. This bill invests $35 billion in our children, providing health insurance for an additional four million children and bringing the total number of children covered by SCHIP to ten million. This bill will also help states provide millions of children with the dental and mental  health services they so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this is a very good bill, it is not perfect and I hope it will serve as a starting point in a larger conversation about how we find a way to ensure coverage for everyone, but particularly for children and low income seniors, the most vulnerable amongst us. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to come to an agreement on how to increase coverage to the level the House bill provided. Additionally, I would like to join my colleagues in covering legal immigrant  children and pregnant women, which the House bill ensured. Finally, I hope that the House and Senate will agree upon a strong Medicare bill that rolls back payment cuts and addresses payments based solely upon where a physician practices. This has made it incredibly difficult for physicians in Sonoma County to continue to see Medicare patients. The House bill addressed the geographic inequity and is a great starting point for a conversation about how to address this serious issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, as the Chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, I am proud to support the language in this bill that will provide military families with the protections they need in the workplace. For the first time since Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) fourteen years ago, this bill will amend FMLA to provide the spouse, child, parent, and closest blood relative of an injured service member with six months of unpaid, job protected leave to care for  their injured loved ones. Congressman GEORGE MILLER and I worked closely with Senators CHRISTOPHER DODD and HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON to ensure that the provisions of <bill type="h" number="3481">H.R. 3481</bill>, the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act, were included as part of the final compromise reached between the House and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing this bill will mean a real investment for our children and I hope that we consider it a starting point for a conversation about covering every child.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman DINGELL as well as the Democratic leadership for working so hard to bring the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization bill before us today. <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill> is not a compromise that was easily come by, and it's important to recognize the hard work that has gone into it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be clear, today each of us is either voting for providing healthcare to more uninsured children, or voting against covering more uninsured kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not the bill that I would have written, nor is it as good as the bill that passed the House. But it will cover the 6.6 million children currently covered by CHIP and will reach an additional 4 million kids. It also provides children with dental coverage and finally puts mental health services on par with other medical benefits covered under the program. This bill will also improve quality improvement, outreach, and enrollment efforts under CHIP, and will target those most in need.  It is a good bill that we think will get to the President's desk. Thus, I think the commitment this bill makes to our children should be celebrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, we need to push further and pass several provisions that were in the house bill, including meaningful improvements in access to basic health services, including granting access to our legal immigrant children, more affordable prescription drug costs and benefits for senior citizens and people with disabilities, and adequate reimbursements for physicians that provide critical care to the Medicare population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incredibly, President Bush has pledged to veto this compromise, bipartisan, bicameral measure. The President and the Congressional Republican leadership say that we cannot afford it. We can't afford to cover children, but we can afford the war in Iraq. The bill to provide health care to children will cost $35 billion over the next 5 years--but we will spend over $50 billion in the next 5 months in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this bill could have been so much more to so many of our constituents, it does  bring us a necessary, moderate expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this compromise legislation which will provide healthcare for 10 million low-income American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will give 4 million currently uninsured children a healthy start in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet in a confirmation of the White House's pitiless priorities, President Bush is threatening to veto this bill if we spend any more than $5 billion dollars over 5 years to help poor American children get health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year alone, the President requested 40 times that amount--$200 billion dollars--for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet he has threatened to veto SCHIP on the basis that it spends too much money on American children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President constantly chooses Corporations over Children, spending billions on tax cuts for millionaires and subsidies for his friends in big oil without batting an eyelash. But when it comes to giving our country's poor children health care, he can't find the heart to come up with the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's debate is a major moment in the history of health care, and a veto will place the President firmly on the wrong side of history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By vetoing this bill, President Bush will expose himself as a Compassionless Conservative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By vetoing SCHIP, the President will dash hopes of millions of working families who dreamed that they would be able to provide health care for their sick children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to stand with those working families and help their children get the health care they need. Vote yes on this critical legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400412" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said "Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane." <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill> does not end health care inequality, but it will provide continued coverage for children not covered by Medicare but whose parents cannot afford to buy insurance and whose employers do not provide it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These children--currently 6 million of them--are now eligible for coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)--but that program is set to expire at the end of this month. If Congress does not act, these six million will no longer have access to quality, affordable health insurance. This bill responds to that urgent need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would assure continued coverage for those now enrolled and would provide coverage for an additional four million children who currently qualify, but who are not yet enrolled under CHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that health care should be a right, not a privilege, and this act is a step in the right direction toward that goal. So, I will support it although I wish it went further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite claims by some, this bill does not change the basic nature of the CHIP program. Instead, it maintains current eligibility requirements for CHIP. The majority of uninsured children are currently eligible for coverage--but better outreach and adequate funding are needed to identify and enroll them. This bill gives states the tools and incentives necessary to reach millions of uninsured children who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I vote for the "CHAMP" bill to extend CHIP. The House of Representatives passed that bill, and I had hoped the Senate would follow suit. It would have increased funding for the CHIP program to $50 million, instead of the lesser amount provided by this bill. The CHAMP bill would have also addressed major health care issues, first by protecting traditional Medicare and second by addressing the catastrophic 10 percent payment cuts to physicians who serve Medicare patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the bill before us represents a compromise between the House and the Senate and deserves support today. It will pay for continued CHIP coverage by raising the federal tax by $0.61 per pack of cigarettes and similar amounts on other tobacco products. According to the American Cancer Society, this means that youth smoking will be reduced by seven percent while overall smoking will be reduced by four percent, with the potential that 900,000 lives will be saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill> has the support of the American Medical Association, American Association of Retired Persons, Catholic Health Association, Healthcare Leadership Council, National Association of Children's Hospitals, American Nurses Association, US Conference of Mayors, NAACP, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and United Way of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to vote for this bill that seeks to protect those that are most vulnerable in our society by increasing health insurance coverage for low-income children. I hope that we have the opportunity to take up the other important Medicare issues addressed in the CHAMP bill soon.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400332" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>, which extends and expands the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation to cover all our children so every child in America can grow up healthy. It's the right thing to do; it's also the cost-effective thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The great Minnesotan Hubert H. Humphrey once said that a key moral test of government is how we treat those who are in the dawn of life, the children. We must not flunk this moral test!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home state of Minnesota started covering children through its medical assistance program even before SCHIP was created, but we still have far too many children without coverage--73,000 kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I strongly support extending and expanding SCHIP. I also hope we can work together to provide greater access to private insurance coverage for America's children and other uninsured Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This SCHIP legislation also avoids cutting any of the payments to Medicare Advantage and other critical programs, as it is financed primarily by a cigarette tax increase. So this bill will cover our children without cutting benefits for our seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill. With an expiration of this crucial program looming on September 30, we cannot afford to wait any longer. It's time to break down the barriers to health care for our kids. It's time to reauthorize SCHIP. It's time that all kids have a chance to grow up healthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the U.S. Senate, we should pass this SCHIP reauthorization with a strong bipartisan vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's put children's health first and do the right thing. Let's pass this reauthorization of SCHIP and reduce the number of uninsured children by at least 70 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no better investment than to invest in the health and well-being of America's children.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. I support the Children's Health Insurance Program Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a shame that we live in the richest country of the world, yet 3.8 million children are uninsured. 33,000 of these children are in my District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is not about politics, it's about helping hardworking families and the poorest among us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leaving children uninsured is unacceptable. With health care costs going up, working families are on the edge. Expanding coverage is the only solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that this bill does not cover pregnant women and children who are legal permanent residents. This is a health care issue, not an immigration issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A simple pre-natal exam can detect future complications and prevent costly visits to the emergency room. This would save tax payers millions of dollars in the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No mother who is working here legally and paying taxes should have to choose between buying baby formula and taking her infant to the doctor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No child should die from a sore throat or be denied access to lifesaving treatments. It costs less than $3.50 a day to cover a child through SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the time to play politics, our children must come first. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400427" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise as a supporter of the State Children Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which focuses on covering children in families at or below 200 percent of the poverty level ($41,000 per year). I have voted to extend this program and to provide additional resources to ensure that those living in families below 200 percent of the poverty level ($41,000) have access to affordable health insurance through the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I cannot support is the Democrat's SCHIP bill, because their bill: 1. Fails to place a priority on first enrolling uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year (200 percent of the federal poverty level); 2. Expands government subsidies to those making nearly $80,000 per year; 3. Spends half of the additional SCHIP dollars to enroll children in the government SCHIP program who were otherwise enrolled in private insurance; and 4. Virtually eliminates all funding for  SCHIP beyond 2012 because they have no way to sustain funding for SCHIP beyond that date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fiscally irresponsible to expand this program by enticing millions of children in families earning as much as $82,000 per year to drop private coverage and enroll in the SCHIP program that cannot be sustained. In August, House Democrat leaders forced an earlier version of SCHIP through the House that cut over $150 billion from Medicare and moved that money into SCHIP so that they would have a way to pay for millions of new SCHIP enrollees over the next ten years, including millions of currently  insured children from middle and upper middle class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their plan to cut Medicare was rejected not only by Republicans, but by the U.S. Senate,  and most importantly by the public at large. But now the bill before us is simply a bait and switch. They have brought a bill before us today that nearly triples the size of SCHIP over the next five years--including enrolling millions of children currently ensured by private plans--only this time they have chosen to hide from the public how they plan to pay for  the program for the next ten years. They ramp up the annual budget of SCHIP to nearly $14 billion a year, and then they simply leave it to a future Congress to find a way to continue paying for the massively expanded SCHIP program. It turns out that their nearly tripling of the federal cigarette taxes still leaves them tens of billions of dollars short. Americans should be on notice that in 2012 the Democrats will ask for another $180 billion to continue SCHIP for another ten years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Particularly troubling is that by significantly expanding SCHIP enrollment eligibility those in families making upwards of $80,000 per year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that millions of new SCHIP enrollees will be children that move from private coverage to the SCHIP program. By moving children from private insurance onto the government program, this bill essentially enrolls five uninsured children for the price of ten. Enticing millions of children to drop private coverage  and sign up for SCHIP is short-sighted and fiscally irresponsible, particularly given that it goes bankrupt in 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we should be doing is focusing this program on enrolling uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year. Mr. Chairman, our children and the American taxpayers deserve better that what the Democrat leadership has put before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February of this year, states that had overspent their SCHIP funding grants came to Congress begging for more money to "insure uninsured poor children." The root problem in many of these states was the fact that they had use their federal grant to enroll children in the SCHIP program who were neither poor nor uninsured. New Jersey, for example had used their grant to enroll children in families with incomes of more than $72,000, even though there were and still are over 150,000 children  in New Jersey in households earning less than $41,000 who are uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offered an amendment in February that would have refocus SCHIP to make sure that children in families under 200 percent of the poverty level were covered first. My amendment was rejected by the liberal majority on the Committee, who stated that they had no intent to refocus SCHIP on lower income children. Rather, they planned to continue expanding the program to those well above the poverty level--to include adults and illegal immigrants--as a step toward universal government-run health care.  In today's Washington Post, liberal columnist E.J. Dionne Jr., removes any doubt of this goal by writing: "This battle [over SCHIP] is central to the long-term goal of universal coverage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the press releases about today's bill focus on uninsured low-income children, the language in the bill is about much more than uninsured low-income children. If the bill before us was focused on low-income uninsured children, I would be voting for it. The bill before us does the opposite. It repeals recent rules requiring states to ensure that at least 95 percent of those under 200 percent of the poverty level are insured under their state SCHIP programs. Democrats leaders in Congress have  responded to the rule by arguing that there is no way to ensure a 95 percent enrollment rate of uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year. They argue that since they cannot achieve the goal we should simply expand the program to those in households earning more than $80,000 or more a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They use budget gimmicks to say that their bill is balance and paid for through higher cigarette taxes. The Heritage Foundation has estimated that the amount of money Democrats estimate they will raise from higher cigarette taxes comes up billions of dollars short and that over the next 10 years they will have to find 22 million new smokers to bring in the amount of cigarette tax revenue they hope to raise. (It is also noteworthy that lower-income Americans pay a higher percentage of cigarette  taxes, but it is middle-income Americans that will receive most of the expanded SCHIP benefits under this bill.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also concerned over provisions included in the bill that repeal the requirement that individuals must prove citizenship in order to enroll in Medicaid and SCHIP. This opens the program to fraud and the enrollment of illegal immigrants. In 2006, the Inspector General (IG) of the Department of Health and Human Services found that 46 states allowed anyone seeking Medicaid or SCHIP to simply state they were citizens. The IG found that 27 states never sought to verify that enrollees were indeed  citizens. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that repealing this requirement will cost $1.9 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally from a Florida perspective, Florida taxpayers come up short. Florida taxpayer will send $700 million more to Washington than we will receive back in SCHIP allocations. Where will Florida taxpayer dollars end up going? Residents of California, New York, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and New Jersey will be the biggest recipients of Florida tax dollars. Yet, Florida has a higher rate of uninsured children that several of these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Florida voters will also be asked to foot part of the bill for a $1.2 billion earmark inserted into the 300-page bill at the last minute by the powerful chairman of the committee for his home state of Michigan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, here we are again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, we are being forced by the Democratic Leadership of the House to vote on a bill of vital importance to millions of our constituents without the ability to actually analyze its contents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, Mr. Speaker, we are being forced by the Democratic Leadership to vote less than 24 hours after they introduced a bill that is hundreds of pages long and spends hundreds of billions of the taxpayers' dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, Mr. Speaker, we are being forced to vote on a bill that was concocted in secret and unveiled in the middle of the night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this sort of thing happens, everybody wonders what the Majority is trying to hide, and why they need to hide anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly hope that the Democratic Leadership does not expect me to vote in favor of a 299-page bill that Republicans saw for the first time at 6:36 p.m. yesterday evening. I believe in faith, but not in blind faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I challenge the supporters of this bill to come to the floor of this House, look people in the eye, and say that they understand all of the provisions that are actually in this bill. Because I have some questions for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it would be a compliment to say that the so-called process which produced this bill is an abuse of our democratic system of government. It was so much worse than garden-variety abuse. It was a travesty and an abomination, and it was pathetic. Yet, I'm sure that some will show up here with a handful of talking points from the staff who actually wrote this legislation, and explain to us that it is not a pathetic abomination, but a wondrous triumph of bipartisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I challenge any Member that would claim that this bill is bipartisan to give me the name of one Republican in the entire House of Representatives who directly participated in these discussions. Name just one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the authors of this bill certainly did not consult with either Mr. DEAL or myself; I know that they have not included any Members of the Republican Leadership in the House; and I'm not aware of a single Republican Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Ways and Means Committee being invited to participate in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we have not had time to analyze this product that the Democrats are going to bring to the floor today but the Congressional Budget Office has. Yesterday at the Rules Committee, it was stated that this bill would put 4.4 million new people on to SCHIP. However, according to the CBO close to a million of those children were already enrolled in Medicaid and over 1.5 million of those newly enrolled in SCHIP were already enrolled in private coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was also stated last night at the Rules Committee that this bill does not expand eligibility under SCHIP. If that is the case then why does the CBO estimate 1.2 million of the newly enrolled people in SCHIP come from expanding the populations that are eligible for the program? Now those comments last night could have been misstatements because people just really do not know what is in this bill. It is difficult to know what is in a bill that no one has seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wonder if someone can explain to me why the Democratic Leadership has decided to wait until just days before SCHIP expires to bring their reauthorization to the House floor. We have known for well over 10 years that the current SCHIP authorization would expire on September 30, 2007, and the Democratic Leadership in the House and the Senate have known since early November that they would be in charge of actually producing a bill to reauthorize this vital health care program for  low-income, uninsured children. Yet, here they are, a full 10 months later, jamming a bill through the House with fewer than three legislative days before the entire program expires and children's health care stops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Mr. Speaker, I was not sent here by the 6th District of Texas to be quiet and do what the gentle lady from San Francisco instructs me to do. I was sent here to represent my constituents' best interests and I demand the ability to do what I have sworn to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that the President has promised to veto this version of the bill, so why are we wasting precious time on a bill that we all know doesn't stand a chance of ever becoming law?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we are down here on the floor participating in this Theatre of the Absurd, the  Democratic Leadership is in the back rooms trying to figure how they will extend the SCHIP program for another 6 months or a year. We all know this to be a fact, but I guess the Democrats want to pick a fight with the president so they can pretend that he is against children, and only then will they permit everybody to do the right thing and extend SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry it's come to this. The pettiness of this transparent political strategy to damage and weaken the president is a new low. I regret that the state of political strategy has come to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd hoped that we would not engage in this game, and it's still not too late to stop it. We could start debating how to best extend the SCHIP program so that we can actually do the job people sent us here to do. We still have a chance to write a responsible, long-term reauthorization of the SCHIP program. Now, it's true that writing a solid, bipartisan bill will not give the president a black eye, but that's the price that Democrats will have to pay. Given that millions of needy children are  depending on us, it doesn't seem like a big price.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan, bicameral Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CHIP Reauthorization Act will reauthorize and improve the very successful Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, for 5 years. This bipartisan bill will preserve coverage for the 6 million children currently enrolled who otherwise would have no access to health insurance while, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), extending coverage to 3.8 million children who are not enrolled in the program. By reauthorizing this very important program, we will strengthen CHIP's  financing, improve the quality of health care children receive, and increase health insurance coverage for low-income children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this bill maintains the guaranteed dental coverage and mental health parity provisions that were in the CHAMP Act. Good oral health care is important to the overall health of children. No family should have to suffer the loss of a child because they lack the access to care, as happened in the tragic case of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Marylander who died earlier this year when an infection from an untreated abscessed tooth spread to his brain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation increases the tobacco tax by 61 cents to a total of one dollar. Increasing the tobacco tax will save billions in health costs and is one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco use, especially among young children. The 2000 U.S. Surgeon General's report found that increasing the price of tobacco products will decrease the prevalence of tobacco use, particularly among kids and young adults. In short, raising the tobacco tax will prevent thousands of children from starting  to smoke and the proceeds of the tax will be used to provide health coverage for children. That is a win-win result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has said that he will veto this bipartisan bill. Not so long ago in a September 2004 speech, he promised to expand coverage of CHIP to include eligible children who are not yet enrolled in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the President has reversed course. In his July 2007 speech in Cleveland, Ohio, he forgot his 2004 pledge and stated, "I mean, people have access to health care in America. After all, you just go to an emergency room." I am disappointed that he will wield his veto pen on such promising legislation. I hope he will reconsider his position and help Congress provide health insurance to millions of America's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this much needed bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and to express my dismay over one particular matter not addressed by today's conference agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its creation in 1997, the CHIP's flexibility, in combination with existing Medicaid programs, has proven highly effective in reducing the number of children who are uninsured in the United States. The bill before us today will invest $35 billion in the program over the next 5 years, ensuring that 6.6 million children currently enrolled will continue to have a health program and allowing for the growth in the program predicted over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad that the bill will allow California and other innovative states to continue to cover families--the health of children is inextricably entwined with that of the family as a whole. I am especially pleased that this bill includes full dental coverage and mental health parity, recognizing that physical health care is only one part of effective health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the desperately needed reforms contained in this legislation, I am deeply disappointed that the conferees did not include language from the House-passed Children's Health and Medicare Protection, CHAMP, Act that would have given states the option of choosing to waive the five year waiting period for Medicaid and CHIP imposed on pregnant women and children who are legally present in the United States. It is unconscionable that Congress will make pregnant women and innocent children pawns  in a raucous and frequently misleading immigration debate. I was proud that the House included language that would allow states to make their own decision on this matter and I am saddened that Congress bowed to reactionary anti-immigrant voices on this particular matter and excluded it from this conference agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite my concern, I support this legislation, as I believe that it is too important to allow to lapse. I hope that House leadership will take note of my and others' concerns about the denial of coverage to legally present, otherwise eligible, immigrant children and pregnant women and will work with us to bring this matter to resolution in as swift a manner as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad that the Democratic and Republican leadership have been so active in ensuring that we get this bill to the President before the program expires on September 30th, 2007. With passage of this bill, the health of millions of American children will depend on the stroke of the President's pen. I am sure that I express the sentiments of millions of Americans when I say that I hope the President will make the morally correct choice not to veto healthcare for children when this agreement reaches  his desk.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the State Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007. This legislation renews and strengthens a program that provides health insurance to children whose families cannot afford it on the private market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are voting on today will extend children's health insurance to enroll almost 4 million kids that are currently eligible for the program and not yet enrolled. That's in addition to the 6 million low-income children already receiving health care under the SCHIP program nationwide, including 55,000 kids in my home state of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret that many of the provisions the House included this summer did not make it into the compromise bill. I'm hopeful that we will work with the Senate to approve legislation before the year's end in order to ensure Medicare beneficiary access to physicians and stop the further erosion of Medicare solvency. Nonetheless, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote in support of the compromise bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing health care for children should not be a partisan issue. The legislation has the support of a large majority of state governors, Republicans and Democrats alike. The bill has broad bipartisan support in the Senate; unfortunately, most of the Republican minority in the House has failed to join us in crafting this compromise and the President has threatened to veto this important legislation. So it comes down to this: Clearly, a majority of the House will vote for the SCHIP bill today;  the only real question is whether the House will pass this bill with enough votes to discourage a Presidential veto. Do we stand with the President or with kids who need health care coverage?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of working with Congress to expand health care coverage for children, the President's proposal would actually cause 840,000 kids that are currently covered under SCHIP to lose their benefits, not to mention leave hanging the 4 million children that Congress' bill would bring into the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want the children of America covered by health insurance. A bipartisan majority of House and Senate Members are committed to carrying this out. The question remains as to whether or not the Bush Administration will get on board.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I insert these remarks into the Record in response to some unfortunate remarks made on the House floor regarding a provision in the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill>. A statement was made suggesting that a certain provision had been inserted in the bill to solely benefit my home State of Michigan, a statement that could not be further from the truth. The provision for which this accusation was made in reality would ensure that  all States would not be penalized due to factors in Medicaid funding that are beyond their control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, is the formula used to calculate the amount of Federal funding distributed to States to offset Medicaid expenses. The Federal Government's share of a State's Medicaid funding is based on the State's per capita income. Put simply, States with lower per capita incomes receive more Federal Medicaid funding; States with higher per capita incomes receive lower Federal Medicaid funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to recent changes to accounting rules, the current FMAP formula needs to be updated. Accounting rules that require employers to pre-fund employee pension and insurance funds may cause a State's per capita income to be calculated far higher than it really is. To  comply with the rules, employers may occasionally have to make large transfers to a pension or insurance fund. This money is counted in the calculation of a State's per capita income in the  year of the transfer, even though it may not be paid out for years. When this occurs, a State then appears wealthier than it is, causing the State to lose Medicaid funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FMAP adjustment included in the CHIP Reauthorization Act corrects this unfair penalty. It simply ensures that when an employer makes a significantly disproportionate pension or insurance contribution, the State is not denied much-needed Medicaid funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This adjustment provision is not limited to any single State. In fact it now applies to three States, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. It may well be that many more States will have cause to complain about this soon, unless it is corrected. It would apply to any State in any instance where there is a significantly disproportionate employer pension or insurance fund contribution that exceeds 25 percent of a State's increase in personal income for a year.</paragraph>
