    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to highlight the continued and critical need for post-Katrina health care recovery funding for those hospitals that have struggled to this day to provide critical medical services in the New Orleans region. The Congress has been extremely helpful to the State of Louisiana in providing funding support for many Katrina and Rita recovery purposes. However, minimal assistance has been provided to enable the greater New Orleans area hospitals to maintain adequate  and required health care operations. The affected hospitals, specifically East Jefferson General Hospital, Ochsner Health System, Touro Infirmary, Tulane Medical Center, University Hospital, and West Jefferson Medical Center, provided over 90 percent of all regional hospital-based health care, and are expected to do so for at least the next five years. It is vitally important that this health care base be maintained in order to preserve other recovery efforts throughout the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisiana hospital executives have testified before Congress concerning the post-Katrina health care funding crisis caused by escalating expenses that significantly outpaced revenues, with no immediate stabilization expected; post-Katrina labor expenses that increased by $140 million; non-labor expenses--i.e. utilities, insurance, interest, bad debts--that increased by $300 million; and fewer skilled healthcare professionals. The regional hospitals are experiencing reduced bond ratings--with  defaults looming--increased marketing and recruiting expenses, and even a loss of leadership. The Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General--OIG--and the General Accounting Office, through extensive and voluntary audits, have objectively validated the magnitude of these post-Katrina financial losses and the demonstrated need for New Orleans regional hospital disaster assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To stabilize critical health care services in the region, the New Orleans area hospitals require a federal funding "bridge" as they transition to a firmer economic base through adjusted wage indexes and other revenue streams. The hospitals are at a critical tipping point in financial losses, and each is determining the steps necessary to remain medically and fiscally sound. Without funding support, the potential reduction in health care services will impact the fragile recovery of the entire  New Orleans region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the pending appropriations bill now before this body, Social Service Block Grant funding is provided to partially address health care and other needs resulting from Katrina, Rita and other hurricanes and natural disasters. I intend to work closely with the President, the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, and other Federal officials to ensure that sufficient block grant funding is provided to the New Orleans regional hospitals to ensure the stability of health care services  in the Katrina-affected regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I was instrumental in crafting this program to help hospitals that, with the electricity off and the city underwater, stayed open by the sheer  guts of their doctors and nurses. I can still see them in my mind, struggling to keep those hospitals open with the city completely underwater and a parish underwater. This is for Orleans and Jefferson. They still have not been reimbursed for the work that they did during Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some reason, we can't get this Congress to understand the importance of what those hospitals did during this great time of need. So I wish to send this in for the Record.</paragraph>
