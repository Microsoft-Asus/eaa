    <paragraph>Mr. President, on the occasion of her retirement from the Department of Defense, I wish to recognize Dr. Patricia Sanders for her nearly 35 years of dedicated service to the security of our country. In her most recent assignment, she served as Executive Director at the Missile Defense Agency, where she advised the Director on issues related to the management and operations of one of the most dynamic organizations within the Department of Defense. Dr. Sanders has made an enormous  contribution to the successful development and fielding of a defense to protect a nation, American troops deployed abroad, and our allies and friends from attack by ballistic missiles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Sanders graduated as a National Science Foundation Fellow from Wayne State University in 1972 with a doctorate in mathematics, where she also was educated in economics, organizational management, and other disciplines. She went on to hold several university faculty positions. It is to our great benefit, though, that Dr. Sanders decided to pursue a career in government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her service within the Department of Defense as a member of the test and evaluation community has been extensive. Prior positions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense included serving as the Director of Land Forces in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation and as Staff Specialist for the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. Dr. Sanders served as Deputy  Director for Analysis with the U.S. Space  Command, Science Adviser to the Command, Control, Communications and Countermeasures Joint Test Force, and Chief of Modeling and Simulation and Technical Advisor to the Electronics Systems Division at the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Sanders has extensive experience as a member of the Department's senior executive service. Before coming to the Missile Defense Agency, she was the Director for Test, Systems Engineering and Evaluation in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, responsible for ensuring the integration of all engineering disciplines into the system acquisition process, providing technical risk assessments and oversight of developmental test and evaluation for many of the  weapon systems used by our Armed Forces today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Sanders held numerous positions within the Missile Defense Agency and its predecessor organization, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. She came to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization in 1999 to be the Deputy for Test, Simulation and Evaluation. In this position, she was also the senior technical advisor to the Director. She served in this capacity until the Secretary of Defense gave the missile defense program a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In early 2002, the start of one of the most dynamic periods in the Agency's history, and shortly after the Missile Defense Agency was established, Dr. Sanders was appointed the Deputy Director for Ballistic Missile Defense System Integration. She played a critical role in managing the development and fielding of an integrated missile defense system. Dr. Sanders played an instrumental role in developing the concept for the Ballistic Missile Defense System and advising Department leaders on the  authorities and responsibilities required to develop and field an effective missile defense system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Executive Director, a role she assumed in 2005, Dr. Sanders advised the Director on issues related to Agency management and operations. She also took on numerous tasks delegated by the Director such as directing the development of strategic communications campaign plans. Perhaps the most striking example of this came in the U.S. Government's European Site Initiative, where her vision for and guidance to this endeavor contributed to the development of a broad consensus among national leaders,  combatant commanders, and the international communities on the growing need to establish a long-range missile defense capability in Europe. Dr. Sanders also helped to realize important cooperative agreements with Japan and Israel, which today are helping contribute to a truly worldwide ballistic missile defense capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During North Korea's provocative missile launches in July 2006, Dr. Sanders coordinated the Agency's actions during this crisis and established a dedicated crisis action team of highly trained staff to provide situation awareness to the President, combatant commanders, and the entire missile defense developer community. She educated senior military and civilian decisionmakers on the capabilities afforded by the deployed elements of the system so that the Nation's plans to deal with the crisis  were based on accurate and timely information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Agency's senior leader dealing with operational and management functions, Dr. Sanders impacted the Agency's operations on a daily basis. She served as a senior interlocutor with all external defense agencies, the Services, and Members of Congress. The Agency's senior civilian, she was also the final arbiter of all issues related to personnel administration and development, directing and managing a diverse staff spanning seventeen time zones. In just the last 2 years, the Agency underwent  a conversion to the new National Security Personnel System and made plans to execute a Base Realignment to Huntsville, AL, by 2011. To help the Agency weather this challenging period, Dr. Sanders instituted several major efforts in strategic human capital planning. She restructured the Agency's strategic mission planning and communications activity, directing a much-needed overhaul of long-range</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years now Dr. Sanders has been a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and, at one point, served as chair of AIAA's Flight Test Technical Committee. She is a past president of the International Test and Evaluation Association and has served on the board of directors for the Military Operations Research Society. She also has devoted significant time to mentoring future Defense Department civilian leaders. Throughout her career, Dr Sanders has been a champion  of diversity and has been dedicated to recruitment and retention of young professionals in the Federal Government. She has been a dedicated mentor to women in the engineering field and has been a role model and pathfinder for women in defense. In addition, while at MDA, Dr. Sanders instituted a mentoring program for defense acquisition professionals, established an active career intern program and a Presidential management fellowship program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Patricia Sanders has consistently exemplified the finest attributes of a senior executive dedicated to public service. Her contributions, leadership, and service are well known throughout the Department. I am honored and proud to enter this tribute to Dr. Patricia Sanders into the official record. On behalf of all my colleagues, and with deep gratitude in my heart, I wish her the best as she embarks on the next journey in her life.</paragraph>
