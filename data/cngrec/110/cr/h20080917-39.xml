  <narrative> Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. LOCATION OF VERITAS PROJECT.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Public Law 108-331 (118 Stat. 1281) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) in the long title, by striking "on Kitt Peak near Tucson, Arizona" and inserting "in Arizona"; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) in section 1, by striking "on Kitt Peak near Tucson, Arizona" and inserting "at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Base Camp on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, or other similar location".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="sj" number="35">S.J. Res. 35</bill>, which amends Public Law 108-331. This public law provided for the construction and location and related activities in support of the VERITAS project in Arizona.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Senate resolution amends this law by identifying another location for the VERITAS project. <bill type="sj" number="35">S.J. Res. 35</bill> authorizes the Smithsonian to relocate the telescope to Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Base Camp on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, from the original site at Kitt Peak, Arizona. This is a simple but necessary change, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 35 that would amend Public Law 108-331 to provide for the Smithsonian Institution's construction of certain facilities in support of the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, or VERITAS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VERITAS project is a collaboration with the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy as the lead agencies. Universities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland are participants in this work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal of the VERITAS project is to increase our ability to view gamma-ray radiation in space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Studying gamma ray radiation from objects like exploding stars and black holes will help increase our scientific understanding of the universe. In 1968, the first telescope was created to observe this gamma ray radiation. VERITAS significantly enhances this technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Congress authorized the Smithsonian to construct a control building to support the VERITAS project. The control building would include space for computers, technical equipment, and other facilities for researchers to carry out their work with the new telescopes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original legislation authorized the control building to be built in Kitt Peak, Arizona, where the VERITAS project was expected to be located. Site and construction preparation began in Kitt Peak in 2004 on land leased to the U.S. Government by a local Indian tribe. Unfortunately, in 2005, the  project was halted when a lawsuit was brought and the National Science Foundation issued a stop work order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, the NSF and the DOE began to undertake new environmental assessments of the Kitt Peak site and, in 2005, started initial work on the VERITAS telescopes 35 miles away at the Fred Lawrence Base Camp in Mount Hopkins, Arizona. The plan was to move the telescopes to Kitt Peak following completion of the necessary assessments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the assessment process continued into 2007 and there were concerns about missing windows of opportunities for joint work planned with NASA's gamma ray telescope satellite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of this, the VERITAS team sought and received approval from the United States Forest Service to test the telescopes at the Whipple Base Camp. The testing revealed that the Whipple location produced results comparable with those they expected at Kitt Peak. As a result, the collaborative partners agreed that the VERITAS project should remain at the Whipple Base Camp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation enacted in 2004 authorized the construction of a control building by the Smithsonian for the project; however, it specified Kitt Peak, Arizona, as the project location.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate resolution today would amend that law to authorize the construction of the control building at the Whipple Base Camp in Mount Hopkins, Arizona, where the VERITAS project is now located.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution does not authorize any additional funds for the project. The resolution simply authorizes the change in the location of the project at no additional cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the gentlelady does not have any further speakers, Madam Speaker, I would go ahead then and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="sj" number="35">S.J. Res. 35</bill>, which amends Public Law 108-331 to provide for the construction and related activities in support of the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, "VERITAS", project in Arizona. Public Law 108-331 was passed in October 2004 during the 108th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This joint resolution authorizes the Smithsonian Institution to permanently locate the telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Base Camp on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, which is approximately 35 miles from the original site, Kitt Peak's Horseshoe Canyon. The Smithsonian Institution has set up the telescope at this site on an interim basis and the VERITAS Science Consortium and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory request that the VERITAS telescope remain at the Whipple Observatory for  the rest of its scientific life. As a result, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution requests an amendment to Public Law 108331 to authorize the Board to locate the VERITAS telescope at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Base Camp on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, or other similar location.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="sj" number="35">S.J. Res. 35</bill>.</paragraph>
