  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="SERGEANT JAMES W. HARLAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, while I am in my leader time, I rise today to honor the heroic sacrifice of a fellow Kentuckian, a brave soldier who served multiple tours in Iraq. He was also a proud father and grandfather who sought to protect the people and the land he loved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SGT James W. Harlan was tragically killed on May 14, 2004, when a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb next to his humvee at Camp Anaconda near Balad, Iraq. Sergeant Harlan was a native of Owensboro, KY, and a member of the 660th Transportation Company's 88th Regional Readiness Command in the U.S. Army Reserve. He was 44 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his heroic service, Sergeant Harlan was awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart, among many other awards and medals of distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned that Sergeant Harlan was brave; let me elaborate on that. When he was 11 years old, his older sister Doris was assigned the daunting task of babysitting young Jimmy. "Jimmy was mischievous. He was always into something," she recalls. Sensing a window of opportunity to display his courage, Jimmy declared that he would jump off the roof of their family's house while his parents were away. At first Doris protested, but realizing that his intentions were probably only to rankle her,  she told Jimmy: "Fine, you go ahead and do it." She even went so far as to set out pillows for him to land on. Sure enough, brave young Jimmy jumped off that roof, and to this day Doris is surprised that he escaped without major injury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jimmy's love of adventure carried over into his adulthood. He enjoyed the outdoors and would often take his kids fishing and hunting. A compassionate and loving father to his five children, Jimmy always made sure to spend quality time with his family. "When everyone else was sitting around with their bellies full on Thanksgiving, he would be outside throwing the football," his brother Kenny Likens recalls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of his favorite things to do was to coach baseball with his brothers. When he spent time indoors, he enjoyed watching old Western movies with his kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His sons, James Bryan Harlan, David Shane Harlan and Jacob Alexander Roberts, and his daughters, Tara Strelskey and Amanda Prout, as well as his two stepchildren, Bobby and Brittany Gray, will miss his caring and generous spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jimmy will also be missed by two girls who might not yet realize the extraordinary sacrifice their grandfather made, but who will learn it as they grow older. He was especially proud of them. Jimmy often said of his granddaughters, Jaidyn Main and Abigail Prout, "Aren't they just the prettiest things you have ever seen?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jimmy's civilian career was partly spent as a truck driver. He enjoyed the opportunity to work on the big rigs and to see different parts of the country. He would often drive with his brother Kenny Likens. Through all that driving across the country, though, the two never did find a place they liked as much as their hometown of Owensboro, KY, where Jimmy was born and raised. When Jimmy left for his final tour in Iraq, he was working for the streets department in Owensboro.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having served for two decades in the military and Reserves, Jimmy was a seasoned soldier. His patriotism and sense of civic duty compelled him to reenlist after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and he served two tours in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there, Jimmy supervised truck drivers who transported supplies to the troops at Camp Anaconda. His son James Bryan Harlan offered some perspective when he remarked:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nobody wants to see their father die ..... but to have it be while doing something of this significance, we're proud of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to say that not only is his family proud of him, but all of America is proud of Jimmy's heroism and sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SGT James W. Harlan drove a rig across the highways of the United States, and he traversed the desert sands of Iraq. He had an adventurous spirit, and his far travels and his exemplary service were a natural fit for that little boy who once jumped off his parents' roof.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jimmy Harlan left an inspirational example for his children and grandchildren, his brothers, Kenny Likens and DeWayne Likens; his sister, Doris Taylor; his step-brothers, Randall Wingfield, Steve Wingfield, and the late Michael Calloway; his fiancee, Carol Gray; his mother, Doris Marie Gray; and his late father, William Arthur Harlan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to keep the family of SGT James W. Harlan in their thoughts and prayers. I know they will be in mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
