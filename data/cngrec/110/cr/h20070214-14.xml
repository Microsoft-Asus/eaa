  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in a time of war Americans and those risking their lives to protect freedom deserve leadership, not politics. As we continue to debate this nonbinding resolution today, we undermine the overall war on terror and the successes we have had since the attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the battle for Iraq mistakes have been made, but the President put forth a plan for victory that understands those mistakes and sets benchmarks to ensure Iraqi involvement and success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other side, they want to have it both ways. They say we support our troops, but at the same time they say we don't support the war you are fighting. Our troops deserve better. Either commit to their mission and bring them home victorious or stop their funding and bring them home in defeat. The choices are there in front of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should allow time for the plan to take hold, not put forth a resolution that clearly is a step in the wrong direction, a policy of retreat and defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is only one way out of Iraq, only one way out of this war, victory.</paragraph>
