    <paragraph>Mr. President, I listened to the conversation that has gone on this morning. I have to say I am a little bit disappointed in some of the negative comments about our country. I always thought you had to be an ultimate optimist to serve in this body. Things go slowly, which is probably fortunate, but we just can't keep trying to make ourselves look better by running down our country. I often remind people that I am not aware of anybody trying to get out of our country, but from the past  2 weeks' discussion, I know there are a lot of people trying to get in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will cite an article from the Wall Street Journal of Wednesday, May 23, 2007, that says, "The Poor Get Richer." It reads:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's been a rough week for John Edwards, and now comes more bad news for his "two Americas" campaign theme. A new study by the Congressional Budget Office says the poor have been getting less poor. On average, CBO found that low-wage households with children had incomes after inflation that were more than one-third higher in 2005 than in 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Another article I refer to is from Denver's Rocky Mountain News for April 9, 2007, "Not bad for a much-maligned economy." We keep talking about how bad the economy is. Well, it isn't bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just when your mind may have been grappling with the disturbing news that Circuit City stores had fired 3,400 of their highest-paid hourly salespeople--not to trim the workforce, as you might expect, but to replace those let go with lower-paid workers--along comes the Labor Department with equally startling news, but of a positive bent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March, the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs; the unemployment rate declined again, to 4.4 percent; and average hourly and weekly earnings advanced, with weekly income up 4.4 percent .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article goes on to read:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But after six years of fairly steady economic growth despite a costly war, Katrina, a housing slump and other body blows, fair-minded people should at least entertain the possibility that current policies must be getting something right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It ends by saying:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After all, what exactly is it about the March economic figures that [you] don't like?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
