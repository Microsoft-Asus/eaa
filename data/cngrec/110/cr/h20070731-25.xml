  <narrative>DEMOCRATS DELIVER ON PROMISE TO CHANGE THE WAY BUSINESS IS DONE IN WASHINGTON -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9189]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. HALL of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when Democrats took control of Congress in January, we vowed to make some changes around here. The American people were rightfully disgusted by several examples of unethical behavior that made this entire institution look bad. The Senate and House have now reconciled differences between two different lobbying reform bills passed earlier this year. Today, the House will give final approval to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill requires greater transparency of lobbyists so they are more accountable to the American people. Specifically, the bill requires lobbyists to file their lobbying activities in an electronic database that is accessible to the public. It also ends the K Street Project by prohibiting Members of Congress and their staff from attempting to influence employment decisions in exchange for political access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats said we were going to change the way business is done here, and today we will deliver on that promise by passing the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.</paragraph>
