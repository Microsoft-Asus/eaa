    <paragraph>Mr. President, this coming Monday, May 26, the nation sets aside a day to honor those brave men and women who died in battle while wearing the uniforms of the Nation's Armed Forces. Soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen; officers and enlisted; volunteers and draftees; young and old; they were all members of our American family our fathers, brothers, sons, mothers, wives, sisters, cousins, neighbors and friends. More than 41 million Americans have served their nation during a time of  war over the course of our history. More than 651,000 Americans have lost their lives as a result of that service. It is likely that somewhere in every family's extended network of relatives, neighbors and friends, there is a veteran, perhaps even a veteran whose service and sacrifice we honor on Memorial Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the fact that some 200,000 of our fellow citizens are today wearing uniforms and serving in hostile theaters far from home, too many Americans see Memorial Day weekend only as a long weekend marking the end of the school year, the opening of pools, and the beginning of summer. We are beguiled by the warm breezes redolent of honeysuckle. We are distracted by bright sunshine and outdoor pleasures. We are lulled into a sense of security and carelessness, at home in our safe neighborhoods  with new-mown lawns, cheerful flowerbeds, and shady streets. It is easy to forget that in distant places, men in dusty uniforms patrol dangerous streets mined with improvised explosive devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you take a moment to look more closely, however, you may notice the flags flying from front porches along those shady streets. You might notice other flags, smaller flags, planted in front of marble markers throughout cemeteries around your town, each marking the grave of a veteran. You may notice families visiting gravesites in a ritual as old as war itself, laying down flowers to remember and honor those whose lives were lost too soon, too violently, too far away from home and family, in  pursuit of causes larger than themselves. They are gone, but not forgotten by those who knew and loved them best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>War is a terrible tool of nations, and its use exacts a high price in both blood and treasure. On Memorial Day, the nation honors those who have paid this price with great courage and even greater sacrifice. It is important to remember the lives of those who were lost, lest we come to think that war is ever easy, or quick, or certain in its course. We do well to remember the words of Sir Winston Churchill, 1874-1965: "Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone  who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have meant that many of the gravesites being visited this Memorial Day, more than 4,000 of them, are raw and new. Many of the families visiting those graves bring young children with them, children who have lost a father or mother. They know that their parent died a hero. But that knowledge does not make the day-to-day tasks of school, homework, sports practices, or learning life skills from their parents any easier for these children. It does not make  it any easier for the parent left behind to shoulder a life's work that they thought would be shared with their partner. As a nation, we should not give them any reason to worry that their family member's sacrifice will ever be dismissed or overlooked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ours is a fortunate nation, blessed with a rich and bounteous land. It is populated by hard-working, creative, inventive, people who are generous and compassionate. And, it is governed by the best form of government ever devised by man. The tangible symbols of that government are the documents of our government the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution that set forth the ideals by which we live and operate. As a Nation, we do not always live up perfectly to those ideals in practice,  but we are again fortunate that the system is self-correcting, with the people ultimately in control. None of these fortuitous circumstances could persist, however, without the bravery, valor, and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform who defend our Nation and preserve our Constitution. To them, we owe eternal gratitude. Their willingness to answer the call to battle, and to fight so valiantly and so well in so many conflicts over the years, has kept the Nation strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether they died at Concord, Gettysburg, in Flanders Fields, Vietnam, or in Iraq and Afghanistan; whether their graves date from this century or those that came before, on this last Monday in May, I hope that Senators and all Americans will set aside a few quiet moments to remember, and honor, the men and women who have lost their lives in the service of the Nation. In those quiet moments, I also hope that the Nation will say a prayer for the families they left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close with a few stanzas from a poem by Theodore O'Hara, entitled, "The Bivouac of the Dead."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, Memorial Day is a day of reflection. It is a day reserved for remembering those who have given their lives in service to our country. While we may choose to remember these individuals in different ways, each American has a responsibility to recognize the contribution of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend the values upon which this Nation was built.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, I have had the opportunity to meet with a number of the men and women serving in our military, many of whom I am proud to say are fellow Utahns. I am always very humbled by this experience. The courage and dedication of these individuals offers much to emulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the sacrifice of the countless men and women who over the decades have selflessly given their lives to uphold freedom and defend the many values we hold dear. Each of these individuals not only gave of their own life but left forever altered the life of a mother, father, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, or sister. Those  loved ones who are left behind are owed our respect and support. We must continue to work to ensure the fallen are  remembered and those they leave behind are not forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this time of war, my thoughts and prayers are with all who serve this Nation and with those families who have made the ultimate sacrifice. I am deeply grateful for this service. Please let us not forget the courage and selflessness of these individuals--to them we owe a debt beyond our means to repay. This Nation shall forever stand grateful and proud of each man and woman who has willingly accepted the call to defend our freedoms and provide for our safety at home.</paragraph>
