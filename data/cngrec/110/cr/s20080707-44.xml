  <chair>Whereas Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, genetic disorder that causes destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord due to the poor functioning of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there is no proven treatment or cure for Tay-Sachs disease and the disease is always fatal in children;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the disorder was named after Warren Tay, an ophthalmologist from the United Kingdom, and Bernard Sachs, a neurologist from the United States, both of whom contributed to the discovery of the disease in 1881 and 1887, respectively;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Tay-Sachs disease often affects families with no prior history of the disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas approximately 1 in 27 Ashkenazi Jews, 1 in 30 Louisianan Cajuns, 1 in 30 French Canadians, 1 in 50 Irish Americans, and 1 in every 250 people are carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, which means approximately 1,200,000 Americans are carriers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these unaffected carriers of the disease possess the recessive gene that can trigger the disease in future generations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, if both parents of a child are carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, there is a 1 in 4 chance that the child will develop Tay-Sachs disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a simple and inexpensive blood test can determine if an individual is a carrier of Tay-Sachs disease, and all people in the United States, especially those citizens who are members of high-risk populations, should be screened; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas raising awareness of Tay-Sachs disease is the best way to fight this horrific disease: Now, therefore, be it</chair>
