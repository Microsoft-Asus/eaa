    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a peerless religious leader in our country, Bishop Paul S. Morton, who has been on a mission for God as pastor of Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist Church for the past 33 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He took the helm of Greater St. Stephen when he was 24 years old, and at that time the church had nearly 1,000 members. Over the next 30 years, through dynamic leadership as a premiere pastor, teacher, and award-winning gospel singer, the membership of the church grew to over 20,000 members, the largest church in my State of Louisiana, and one of the largest in the Nation. He is now retiring as its pastor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, God gave Bishop Morton the vision to found the Full Gospel Fellowship. The fellowship now has over 1,500 churches nationally and internationally, including churches in Western Europe, Western and Southern Africa, India, Japan and the Caribbean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Morton will continue to serve as International Presiding Bishop of the Full Gospel Fellowship. We thank God for his service to our community, to our Nation, to the international community, and to almighty God. We wish him God's choicest blessings as he repositions himself for greater service.</paragraph>
