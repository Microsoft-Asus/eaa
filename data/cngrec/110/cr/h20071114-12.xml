    <paragraph>He's also served the community in Napa County. He was a deputy sheriff  for 12 years and an elementary school science and physical education teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He later came to work at the St. Helena Catholic Church. After 5 years of training, he was ordained as deacon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the many services he provides the residents of our community, he also travels throughout Northern California as a military bugler for the funerals of fallen soldiers.</paragraph>
