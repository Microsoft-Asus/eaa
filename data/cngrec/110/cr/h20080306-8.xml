  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last Thursday, I introduced the New Employee Verification Act; it's <bill type="h" number="5515">H.R. 5515</bill>. This proposal will achieve three important objectives: one, ensure a legal workforce; two, safeguard workers identity; and three, protect Social Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Effective work site enforcement is essential to securing our borders. Reforming work site enforcement will affect millions of workers, and it must be done immediately and done right. Having an effective safeguard in place will allow us to have a rational debate about the number of workers we need to legally enter our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill has a mandatory component that builds off of what we've learned from current E-Verify. I also have a component that helps prevent identity theft through the creation of a voluntary system to authenticate and safeguard workers' identities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has strong support in the employer community. I look forward to working with both sides of the aisle to see this bill signed into law.</paragraph>
