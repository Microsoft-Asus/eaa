  <speaking speaker="400206" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the prestigious independent school districts in Collin County, Texas, for their sterling reputation and superior education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forbes Magazine, long-time experts on all things money, recently ranked the public schools in Collin County as second in the entire Nation for the best education for your dollar. What a tremendous distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The students' overall average score was 1102 on the college entrance exam, and the schools boast a 92.2 percent graduation rate. This demonstrates that knowledgeable teachers, community pride, parental involvement and top-quality schools are all working together to achieve academic success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to personally commend the cities of Allen, Frisco, McKinney, Plano and Wylie and their independent school districts for this exceptional award and national recognition for what they do best, teaching our kids and making the future of Texas and the United States even brighter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to all concerned.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
