  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, the Senate has taken an important step in our relationship with Latin America. Following House action last night, the Senate unanimously approved an 8-month extension of the Andean Trade Preference Act, ATPA. Our action today prevents these key trade preferences from expiring abruptly this weekend. More importantly, it underscores the value that United States places on strong economic engagement with our partners in the Andean region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Andean Trade Preference Act provides duty-free access to certain products from Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. These preferences ensure that hundreds of thousands of workers in these countries can find legal and meaningful employment in their own countries--workers who might otherwise find jobs in coca fields or in other illicit industries. By doing so, the Andean trade preferences enable the United States to continue to promote economic and political stability in a key region of Latin  America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ATPA and other preference programs are not a one-way street. I hear repeatedly from American businesses and consumers how these preference programs benefit the United States. Specifically, ATPA provides numerous U.S. companies with a source of high-quality, duty-free inputs for their products. American companies then pass these benefits on to American consumers in the form of lower costs and greater product diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I welcome this extension, I do not wish to minimize legitimate concerns that some of my colleagues have about the program, especially those relating to protection of U.S. investment. ATPA provides a framework for addressing these concerns and finding the solutions. To benefit from these preferences, beneficiary countries must protect foreign investment. They must afford worker rights. They must uphold key intellectual property rights. And they must meet counternarcotics requirements. Because  of these provisions, ATPA is one of the best diplomatic tools America has in Latin America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we took an important step in passing an 8-month extension of ATPA. But 8 months is not a lasting solution. Rather, it is a stepping stone toward a possible longer term extension for ATPA beneficiaries, as circumstances warrant. Eight months from now, some countries may still need these preferences; others may not. During the time, I will closely monitor whether ATPA beneficiary countries live up to their end of the bargain and abide by the requirements of the program. If they do, I will  work hard to secure a longer extension. The United States and the Andean region will be better for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I ask this be completed, I am glad this is being done. I am disappointed it is only until the end of February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I traveled to Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. This is so important to those countries. I am glad we will get it extended. It would have expired at the end of this month. It will not expire now. I hope by next February we can have a multiyear extension. I have spoken to Senators Grassley and Baucus. I hope that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
