  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 600 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 1 hour.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to my friend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, additionally, I ask unanimous consent that our colleagues be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on House Resolution 600.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 600 authorizes the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules at any time through the legislative day of Friday, August 3, 2007, on the following measures:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, <bill type="h" number="3087">H.R. 3087</bill>, a bill to require the President, in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders, to develop and transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy for redeployment of United States Armed Forces in Iraq; and, second, a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to establish a procedure for authorizing certain electronic surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is particularly important at this juncture in my remarks that I make it very clear that we have heard a lot of talk from the other side of the aisle about the need to reform FISA. The Director of National Intelligence has identified a specific intelligence collection gap and spoken of "a backlog for things requiring a warrant," and I quote him. He claims that this is hindering our efforts to prevent terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress, Mr. Speaker, takes its responsibilities to protect the Nation seriously. None of us on either side of the aisle want to leave our intelligence professionals short. The Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, and the leadership have been working around the clock to come up with a solution that addresses this particular problem. However, again and again, the administration has overplayed their hand. Each time we get close to an agreement, they  ask for more, and I might add the negotiations on this have been going on for over a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First they said Congress needed to clarify that the government shouldn't need a warrant to collect foreign communications. There was never ever any disagreement about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they said they wanted broader authority to conduct electronic surveillance of terrorist communications. We agreed to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they said they wanted immunity for the telecommunications carriers. We agreed to give them prospective immunity and would consider retrospective immunity when we get back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we insist on a couple of things. We want to preserve the role of the FISA Court as an independent check on the government to prevent them from infringing on the rights of Americans, and we insist that this legislation have a sunset. In this rushed environment before recess, we should not make permanent changes to FISA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, the congressional leadership was willing to make further changes for Director McConnell. He said with those changes he would support the bill because it would "significantly enhance America's security." And I am quoting him again. But after this agreement was reached, congressional Republicans insisted on a much broader, permanent bill, giving the Attorney General, this Attorney General, not the Court, the discretion to make decisions about surveillance involving Americans. Clearly,  in my judgment, they are not negotiating in good faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If they reject this bill, the other side is saying, in the face of a resurgent al Qaeda, they don't want to plug the collection gap identified by the Director of National Intelligence immediately. They are rejecting "significantly enhancing America's security."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if the other side insists on manufacturing obstructionist delays and rejecting agreements that will enhance our security, we can stay here all August and September and December until we get this done. The security of this Nation deserves no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rule is necessary, Mr. Speaker, because under clause 1(a), rule XV, the Speaker may entertain motions to suspend the rules only on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of each week. In order for suspensions to be considered on other days, as my colleagues well know, the Rules Committee must authorize consideration of these motions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an unusual procedure, as some on the other side may suggest. In fact, in the 109th Congress, alone, my friends on the other side of the aisle reported at least six rules that provided for additional suspension days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rule limits the suspension of rules to only these two bills and will help us move important legislation before we leave for the August recess. Time is, indeed, of the essence. Not because many in this body wish to go home this weekend but, rather, because of the gravity of these situations both here at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this rule and the underlying piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do wish to put my colleagues on notice that, following the conclusion of debate on this rule, I intend to offer an amendment to the rule. My amendment will permit the House to consider emergency legislation today appropriating $250 million to begin the reconstruction of the I-35 bridge, which collapsed this week in Minnesota. We have properly given our condolences and continue those to those who have lost loved ones and those who are awaiting word regarding those who are still missing and those  who have been injured. All of us grieve with all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this amendment and this rule, this legislation will not be permitted to proceed; and these emergency funds would be delayed. Realize a vote against this rule and my amendment to the rule will be a vote against providing this emergency assistance to the people of Minnesota, specifically Minneapolis, Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the gentleman from Florida yielding me time, and I do know that we are here today, among other things, to seek immediate resolution from the United States Congress to help the wonderful people of Minnesota in their time of grief by authorizing money that will be spent to immediately rebuild the bridge that collapsed over the Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All Members of this body watched the horror the other night as we saw not only the collapse but also the heroism of men and women, first responders and others, as they joined in to help the people of Minneapolis-St. Paul as they struggled with this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note that the committee action, regular order, has taken place to make sure that this bill would be before not only the Democrat majority but also we as Republicans participated in each of these activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The gentleman stood up and talked about how great and wonderful and what normal and regular things happen around here, but these are not normal times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again today, here we are on the floor of the House of Representatives almost as a new low, I would say, Mr. Speaker, being asked to debate a rule on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and we don't even have a copy of the bill. So I would like to ask the gentleman from Florida, can we please see a copy of the bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Florida.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>This matter is under suspension. My friend on the Rules Committee and I were there when it passed out of the Rules Committee on suspension, and that requirement is met.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I don't understand this. This new Democrat majority that comes to town, talks about open and honesty, ethics above reproach, all the things that they would do differently than what the Republicans have done, and they have not lived up to that.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>I would yield to the gentleman if he will answer the question: Where is the copy of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that we're doing the rule on today that we're expected to vote on today?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Thank you for yielding. It is in the hopper. The minority members of the Intelligence Committee have the measure.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I would yield to the gentleman from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding, and I see we're joined here by a very distinguished member of the House Committee on Intelligence. I think we have been, for literally months, trying to make in order the legislation that has been introduced by our friend from Albuquerque (Mrs. Wilson), and we believe that that, in fact, is the answer to this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President of the United States, in the news conference that he held with Mike McConnell about an hour ago, made it crystal clear that he is going to ask the Director one question: If he gets legislation that emerges from this body, will it, in fact, enhance our ability to make sure that foreigners on  foreign soil who are trying kill us, if the legislation provides them with the tools to intercept those conversations and prevent them from having the  ability to attack the United States of America?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my friend from Dallas has just very correctly said, can we see the legislation that we're expected to vote upon today if this suspension rule is made in order that will do exactly what the President has said is necessary to ensure the safety and the security of the American people?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from California for his words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Democrat majority has simply not lived up to the words that it spoke when it became the new majority. And it was a campaign promise that is reiterated on a regular basis all through this Chamber and all the committees. Most disappointing among these is the forgotten promise that Democrats promised to be the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I will now quote Speaker Pelosi from page 24 of A New Direction for America, and I quote, "Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I further quote the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, Louise Slaughter, on November 12, 2006, just a week after election. She said, "My fellow Democrats and I have long felt that the Rules Committee was failing its major obligations. We publically argued that it was being used to shut down the legislative process for partisan purposes. But now that the Democrats will control the committee we will have a chance to change all that."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, they have not changed it. They've made it worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do understand right now, as we speak, we have a copy of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that evidently has only now been given to the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>At this time, I am very pleased to yield to my colleague, with whom I've served 7 years on the Select Committee on Intelligence. She was the ranking member and is now the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before yielding to Ms. Harman, who has gone down this road for well over a year to get us to this point, I would like to say to my friend from Texas that perhaps it would be helpful if he would ask the minority members of the Intelligence Committee about the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the measure that we are dealing with is a rule providing for suspension, not consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That said, I yield 3 minutes to my friend from California (Ms. Harman).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="HARMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him for his long service, both on the Intelligence and Rules Committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am now the Chair of an Intelligence Subcommittee of Homeland Security. As no one in this Chamber would miss, security is my passion, and I think it is our primary obligation as Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was sitting here listening to the discussion about where is the bill and why aren't we acting on FISA? It seems a little disingenuous, given the fact that the current ranking member on the Intelligence Committee and former chairman, has an article in USA Today in which he says that this move to get the administration to put its surveillance program under FISA "gives legal protections to foreign enemies who would do us harm."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excuse me? FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act passed by a large bipartisan majority in 1978. FISA was passed to assure that Americans, not foreigners, would have their constitutional rights protected when the U.S. engages, as it must, in foreign intelligence surveillance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think there is anyone here, not that I know of, who is against foreign intelligence surveillance. There is no one in this body, I haven't heard one person say that we think that when the U.S. engages in foreign intelligence surveillance, in foreign countries involving communications between foreigners in different foreign countries, that FISA applies. But FISA can and must apply when Americans' constitutional rights are at issue, and that is the issue we will debate a little bit later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say that it surprises me again that all of a sudden no one knows what we might be talking about. There have been intense negotiations, I have been a part of some of them, for months over what we might do to make FISA work better. In the 109th Congress, all nine Democrats on the Intelligence Committee authored legislation to help FISA work better; and in this Congress I'm aware of both closed and open hearings by the Intelligence Committee to carefully consider these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it seems to me quite surprising and disingenuous to hear that, for example, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee doesn't even feel that FISA protects Americans; he thinks that it coddles foreigners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="WILSON" of="New Mexico">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady because I have some confusion over here, and you may be able to help me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I look at this, I think this is the bill that was rejected by the Director of National Intelligence 36 hours ago as insufficient. And it is not the bill that, as I understand it, was going to be accepted by the Senate this morning that the DNI proposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is the House offering a different bill than has been accepted by the Senate?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The gentlewoman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>I yield the gentlelady an additional minute to respond.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="HARMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I don't have a copy of the latest draft. It may be one I've seen, but I'm not absolutely positive. My understanding is that negotiations have been going on for quite a long time and that the requirements of the DNI have been met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is happening, and I think it's a real tragedy for the American people, is that the goalposts keep moving. I just wonder whether the other side wants this to be a wedge issue or wants to solve the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one Member here who has worked on this for years, I want to solve the problem; and we will attempt to do that under the suspension rules later today.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>You know, Mr. Speaker, we talk about this genuine desire to solve the problem, but the fact of the matter is we're about as close as midnight and noon in our thoughts and beliefs as parties for doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hearken back to just a few days ago in the Rules Committee, where some of the questions from my good friends on the Democrat side are: Well, what about the constitutional rights of some of these people who live in other countries who are known terrorists, what about their constitutional rights? And we need to take those into account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's amazing how we're sitting here debating something that's in the best interests of this country, and some people are more concerned about the terrorists' rights than they are about protecting this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that I have the highest regard for my California colleague (Ms. Harman). She knows that very well. We share representing Los Angeles County here. And I know that she has worked very hard on intelligence issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I will say that I am very troubled with the exchange that I just saw take place between my friend from Albuquerque here, who has worked on this. She talked about the fact that we have legislation that was just rejected 36 hours ago by the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. McConnell. And my friend from California has just said something to the effect that she's not sure exactly what bill it is that we're looking at. I'm not an expert on this myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield to my friend if she wants to respond at all on this.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="HARMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Well, what I meant was that I'm aware that there were negotiations going on with the DNI last  evening. So drafts have been shared back and forth. All I said was that I came over to the floor to support the rule to permit this issue to be addressed under suspension, and I don't have in my hand what may be the latest version.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I know my colleague would certainly share this concern to support the rule, but we like the idea of seeing what it is that we're about to vote upon before we do that. I know that may be an unusual request under this majority, but I think that is definitely fair. And I will say that I think that it's right and correct that Members have a chance to see what it is that they're voting upon, rather than having something thrown upon them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we have Mrs. Wilson, who has legislation that we've offered probably a dozen times on our quest to defeat the previous question on rules so that we could at least allow consideration of this. And so that has led us, I believe, to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think it is just absolute lunacy to believe that we are, at this moment, in a position to go ahead and vote upon something that we don't know what it consists of. And I know my friend would agree with that, that we really shouldn't have a pattern like that.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="HARMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>I would be happy to yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The gentleman's time has expired.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>I yield 30 seconds to Ms. Harman.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="HARMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just to respond to that, I'm not interested in lunacy, and I know that Mr. Dreier is not, and I'm sure that Ms. WILSON and Mr. Hoekstra are not either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a way to solve this problem correctly. I believe that the draft, which I'm certain will be circulated to everybody imminently, I believe that you will see that it is a very careful and balanced effort to address this problem, and it has been shared.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>If the gentlewoman would yield, I think I've got it in my hands right now.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>The gentleman says he has a copy of the bill in his hand. I would remind the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee, who is my good friend, that this rule is to make in order a suspension day.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="DREIER" of="">
    <paragraph>I understand that.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>I'm glad you do understand it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask the gentleman from Texas to ask his Republican colleagues on the Intelligence Committee why they didn't share the bill with the Rules Committee Republicans. We cannot control what you do or do not do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And under the circumstances, Ms. Harman just made it very clear to you that the goalposts keep moving. You try to act as if you don't know that for a year and a half that this has been going on here in this intelligence community, working with this administration, trying to take care of this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now understand this. First, you said on that side that Congress needed to clarify that the government shouldn't need a warrant to collect foreign-to-foreign communications. There was never any disagreement about that, and stop saying it to the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they said they wanted broader authority to conduct electronic surveillance of terrorist communications. We agreed to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they said they wanted immunity for the telecommunications carriers. We agreed to give them prospective immunity and consider retrospective immunity when we get back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, not yesterday, not midnight to noon, and some people have gotten caught in the dark, last night, the congressional leadership was willing to make further changes for Director McConnell. He said that with those changes he would support the bill because it would, in his word, "significantly" enhance America's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But after this agreement was reached, congressional Republicans insisted on a much broader bill giving the Attorney General, not the Court, the discretion to make decisions about surveillance involving Americans. Clearly, in my judgment, as I said previously, you're not negotiating in good faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind you once again that this rule is to make in order a suspension day. You will have all the time you need to do all the reading you need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The Chair will remind Members to address their remarks to the Chair.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire how much time remains.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The gentleman from Texas has 21 1/2  minutes. The gentleman from Florida has 13 1/2  minutes.</chair>
