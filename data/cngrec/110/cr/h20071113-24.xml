  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="TITLE III--AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER INFORMATION FOR 911 PURPOSES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, introduced by Representative Bart Gordon, is designed to ensure that a consumer calling 911 in an emergency from an Internet phone, using so-called "Voice over Internet Protocol," or VoIP service, can do so with a degree of confidence matching that of traditional phone service and wireless service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill seeks to achieve this goal through two key provisions: The first provision extends liability protections to VoIP service providers. The Federal Communications Commission lacks authority to grant liability protection to VoIP service providers, and, therefore, Congress must take action to achieve this policy objective. This is similar to action this subcommittee took in 1999 when such liability protection was accorded to wireless providers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second key provision in the bill establishes the right of VoIP providers to access the parts of the 911 infrastructure they need in order to complete 911 calls for consumers. This is an important provision because while the FCC has acted to require VoIP providers to meet enhanced 911 service obligations, the commission did not order that such VoIP providers had a legal right to the components of the 911 infrastructure they would need to fulfill their E-911 obligations under the commission's  own rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Representative Gordon for his excellent work and leadership on this bill. We have endeavored, over the last several months, to work on a bipartisan basis through several issues, and the bill we bring to the House floor this afternoon reflects the results of these discussions. It is an excellent step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to salute Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Shimkus and Mr. Pickering for their work on this legislation and, as always, to commend the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Dingell; the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Barton; and my good friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) for their excellent efforts as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400414" topic="TITLE III--AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER INFORMATION FOR 911 PURPOSES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take particular time to thank Mr. Markey, my good friend, Mr. Dingell, as well as Mr. Gordon, the bill's sponsor, as well as Mr. Shimkus and Ms. Eshoo for their really outstanding leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill. All of us here know stories, many of us can relate personally to stories, using 911. This goes a bit further when we talk about E-911.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a recent news story that highlighted the importance of this service. A mother in Washington State was playing with her 2-year-old daughter, Alana, one night when suddenly a migraine hit her. She collapsed, she took a few painkillers, she felt dizzy, collapsed to the floor, and yet the 2-year-old daughter, Alana, watching her mom collapse, walked over to the coffee table, picked up the phone, and dialed 911.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While she was on the phone, all she said was "mommy, ouch." Those two words alone were enough to send the paramedics to their home. Inside they found the mom on the floor and the daughter in the other room getting a blanket for her mom who was shivering. Thankfully, she was released the very next day. But without that technology, who knows how the situation, or many others like it, would end up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our 911 system continues to evolve. We've made a lot of progress on enhanced 911 deployment, but E-911 can provide the actual phone number and location of a caller, which can be essential in reaching people who need the  help, especially if they're having trouble communicating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FCC helped move the ball forward in June of 2005 by requiring that VoIP providers offer 911 services to their customers. And while technologically it is more complicated for VoIP providers to provide the service, it certainly is of equal importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've all heard the horror stories in the past of people trying unsuccessfully to use 911 from their homes or mobile phones, and I'm hopeful that with the leaps taken so far, along with this legislation, all consumers, regardless of the phone service or their location, will be better served in an emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, the 911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007, is certainly a significant public safety bill. I would urge my colleagues to vote for it. And, again, I want to thank the bipartisan cooperation that we've seen every step along the way, not only in this body, but in the Senate as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="TITLE III--AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER INFORMATION FOR 911 PURPOSES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would, once again, like to commend the bill to the Members. I also want to thank the staff, Mark Seifert, Amy Levine, David Vogel, Courtney Reinhard, and Dana Lichtenberg on the Democrat and Republican staffs for their excellent work on this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="TITLE III--AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER INFORMATION FOR 911 PURPOSES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, the "911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each time a new communications technology arrives on the market, we must adapt our 911 system and our laws to accommodate it. In 1999, Congress passed the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act to ensure that emergency 911 calls made from wireless phones would go to the nearest Public Safety Answering Point or "PSAP".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Voice-over-Internet-Protocol is revolutionizing the way we communicate by adding the flexibility and innovation of the Internet to the traditional phone call. However, unlike wireless carriers, VoIP providers have no rights to interconnect with the 911 infrastructure and only a handful of 911 centers were prepared to receive VoIP calls, until recently. This left VoIP providers with no easy way to deliver 911 or E-911 service to their subscribers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After people using VoIP phones were unable to call 911 when they needed help, the FCC responded in June 2005 by requiring VoIP providers to incorporate E-911 capability into their service. While this forced VoIP providers to deploy E-911 access to almost all of their subscribers through commercial agreements with third parties, the FCC did not have the authority to address all of the important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>. This bill seeks to better ensure that consumers using VoIP service can access enhanced 911 emergency services. It puts VoIP providers on the same legal footing as wireless carriers and gives providers the same access as wireless, at the same rates, terms and conditions. It gives VoIP carriers and PSAPs receiving the VoIP 911 calls the same liability protection that is afforded to wireless calls. The bill allows VoIP providers  to join wireless carriers in a narrow exemption from the Customer Proprietary Network Information Laws, so that they can transmit customer name and location information during an emergency call. The bill also allows the FCC to delegate to states enforcement of regulations implementing VoIP 911, without disrupting the interstate nature of VoIP service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to ensuring the success of VoIP E-911, <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> takes strong steps to improve our 911 system going forward. First, the bill will stop states from raiding their 911 funds by prohibiting states from spending the 911 line-item fee they collect on phone bills for any purpose other than improvements to the 911 system. Second, the bill directs the E-911 Coordination and Implementation Office to develop a nationwide migration plan to an IP-enabled network. An Internet-based emergency network  will enhance public safety by allowing for greater flexibility in the types and amount of information that may be transmitted to emergency service providers. Finally, <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> alters an existing grant program to allow PSAPs to obtain federal funding for IP-enabled emergency networks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, the "911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007" is about public safety. I want to praise the work of the bill's sponsor, Congressman Bart Gordon, who has provided strong leadership in addressing the VoIP E-911 challenge. I also commend the House co-chairs of the Congressional E-911 Caucus: Congresswoman Eshoo and Congressman Shimkus, for their determined work to advance all 911 issues. I would also like to thank the Telecommunications Subcommittee  Chairman Mr. Ed Markey and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. John Dingell, and their staffs, for their leadership and commitment to working with our side in a bipartisan fashion on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> is an important piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote for it to become law.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="TITLE III--AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER INFORMATION FOR 911 PURPOSES">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>, the "911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation ensures that consumers using Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP technology can access the 911 system. It also requires the development of a national plan to ensure that the 911 system continues to evolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consumers expect that when they place a call to 911 using a wireline phone, wireless phone, or any other type of technology, the emergency operator who answers will send the right type of first responder to the correct location in the shortest time possible. The ability to dial 911 and reach an emergency operator is so integral to our daily lives that we teach our children from the earliest moment how to dial 911.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our communications system has evolved, so too has the 911 system. We have seen this before with the introduction of wireless phone service. As more consumers began using cell phones, Congress passed legislation to ensure that the 911 system could accommodate emergency calls made over the wireless network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last few years, VoIP technology has provided a new way for consumers to make calls using the Internet. <bill type="h" number="3404">H.R. 3404</bill> ensures that consumers using VoIP service are able to access 911 as easily as consumers using wireline or wireless services. <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> will give VoIP providers access to the components they need to provide 911 service and will extend the liability protections afforded to wireline and wireless carriers today to VoIP providers, public safety officials, and end users in relation  to VoIP 911 calls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The constantly evolving nature of technology can present a challenge to legislators. <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> meets that challenge by ensuring that our 911 system continues to adapt. It requires the development of a national plan to migrate to an Internet Protocol-enabled 911 system. It also amends an existing grant program to allow funding for public safety answering points that are moving to an IP-enabled system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As technology evolves, it is important that public safety communications also evolve. Too often public safety is left behind, burdened by yesterday's technology and yesterday's network. <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> therefore requires that public safety representatives participate in the formation of the national plan. This will help ensure that public safety has access to the communications platform of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moving to an IP-enabled 911 system will also benefit consumers with disabilities. <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> requires that the national plan address solutions for providing 911 and enhanced 911 services to members of the disabilities community who may not be able to speak to or hear an emergency operator. By including those representing the disabilities community in the formation of the national plan, we will ensure that all consumers are able to access emergency services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because consumers rely on 911, Congress must ensure that the 911 system is reliable. <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill> fulfills this duty by addressing the addition of VoIP service to the marketplace and by establishing a pathway to the future of the 911 system. This important measure has strong bipartisan support, including the support of the Committee on Energy and Commerce Ranking Member, Representative BARTON, and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Internet, Representative UPTON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Representative GORDON for his excellent work on this legislation. I also thank the other members of the 911 Caucus, and Representatives ESHOO, SHIMKUS, and PICKERING for their important and ongoing work in the area of Emergency communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3403">H.R. 3403</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I've been working on 911 issues for over a decade. We've come a long way during this time, and this bill is another step toward full interoperability. It is essential for our constituents to have access to emergency services whether they're using a mobile phone or using a VOIP service. Confidence that our network will be able to access emergency services when they are needed is fundamental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thanks to Representative GORDON and the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on this 911 legislation which I'm a cosponsor of. The bill places a duty on VOIP services to provide 911 for their customers. This gives customers a guarantee that they will have emergency services when they need it. Importantly, this legislation requires that carriers allow VOIP providers to interconnect with  their facilities. In return, carriers will be  compensated at the same rate that wireless carries pay to interconnect. This interconnection mandate is necessary so that consumers will have timely access to 911 services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will connect the 98 million Americans that live in areas where VOIP providers do not yet have access to the 911 network and are unable to receive reliable VOIP 911 services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague Mr. SHIMKUS and I are co-chairs of the E-911 Caucus and I thank him for his terrific work on this issue. We've worked closely together and passed legislation to provide federal grants to enhance our emergency communications system. So far no funding has been appropriated for this purpose but we were successful in passing an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations that added $5 million for this grant program. The funding "plants the seed" for advanced E-911  equipment so necessary in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good bill and I strongly support it and urge Members to vote for it.</paragraph>
