  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 9 offered by Mr. Sessions:</chair>
  <chair> Strike section 213.&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 213 of this legislation which, as drafted, would have the same anticompetitive effect as language already included in a number of the Democrat majority's other appropriations bills by preventing funds from being spent to conduct public-private competitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, it would prevent funds from being used to allow the private sector to compete against the government for jobs at the Bureau of Prisons or Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this policy may be good for increasing dues payments to the public-sector union bosses, it is unquestionably bad for taxpayers and for Federal agencies because agencies are left with less money to spend on their core missions when Congress takes the opportunity to take competition away from them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, Federal agencies "competed" only 1.7 percent of their commercial workforce, which makes up less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire civilian workforce. This very small use of competition for services is expected to generate savings of $1.3 billion over the next 10 years by closing performance gaps and improving efficiencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competitions completed since 2003 are expected to produce almost $7 billion in savings for taxpayers over the next 10 years. This means that taxpayers will receive a return of about $31 for every dollar spent on competition, with annualized expected savings of more than $1 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision, included by the Democrat Appropriations Committee, directly contradicts a number of legislative provisions recently passed on this issue by the House, including: The conference report for the 1997 omnibus appropriations bill, which specifically directed the Bureau of Prisons to undertake a prison privatization demonstration project; also, the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, which directed the Bureau of Prisons to rehabilitate D.C. inmates  in private prisons; and since 2001, every Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill has directed the Bureau of Prisons to contract for prison services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the answer is clear, Mr. Chairman, that when the Democrats claim that these services are "inherently governmental," despite numerous citations in the A-76 circular that these activities are exempt from this definition, and prevent competitive sourcing from taking place, that the Democrat leadership is clearly hearing from labor bosses that this bill represents another good opportunity to increase their power at the expense of taxpayers and good government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this time of stretched budgets and bloated Federal spending, Congress should be looking to use all of its tools it can to find taxpayer savings and reduce the cost of services that are being provided by thousands of hardworking companies nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense, taxpayer-first amendment to oppose the underlying provision to benefit public-sector union bosses by keeping cost-saving competition available to the government.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this provision is simply a provision of fairness. It provides that contracting out of Federal employees in the U.S. Bureau of Prisons cannot be done under these A-76 guidelines and puts a prohibition on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have accommodated in our language in our manager's amendments all of the concerns that we received from private industry. We have accommodated that. And the bill and report language were modified in the full committee's manager's amendment to clarify that the general provision does not impact the Bureau of Prisons' practice of contracting with State, local and private entities to meet needs for existing and new prison capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This language is compromise language. It protects Federal employees, professionals working in the Bureau of Prisons, who obviously have a very sensitive job and position, at the same time it accommodates the concerns of private industry with regard to appropriate contracting out by State and local and private entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge opposition to the amendment on that basis. The bill is a good, balanced approach and accommodates the Federal employees who risk their lives every day working in correctional situations, but at the same time it accommodates the legitimate concerns of the private sector.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Members who believe in a balanced and fair competition where the taxpayers get the greatest value for the dollar should oppose this amendment and support the underlying bill. The underlying bill, as the chairman said, is a carefully crafted compromise that permits a rational assessment of the cost and benefits of contracting out, and provides for a fair appeal process where whichever side loses that process would have the opportunity to bring its case to another level and have it reexamined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think that the bill is neither pro-contracting out nor anti-contracting-out. I think the bill strikes a fair balance, and it says in instances where someone decides a contract should be permitted, it happens; and for instances where it should not be, it does not.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an important amendment that will help continue our work in Congress to break the cycle of domestic violence from which we still suffer. We started that work in the Violence Against Women Act of 2005. We now need to extend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize the chairman's strong showing of support for efforts against violence in this fashion by $60 million of funding. We appreciate that. But we do have several new programs that the Congress has authorized, has approved, has recognized as a valid effort that have not had an appropriation to date. We aim to fix that with an effort to provide that appropriation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would direct the Department of Justice to administer grants to fund four priority new programs for children and Native women in order to break this chain, this multigenerational chain of violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment offered by myself and Mr. Burton would, for the first time, provide Federal funding to local domestic violence programs that provide direct intervention services to children who have witnessed domestic violence in their families. We know how witnessing violence ends up perpetuating violence down the chain of generations. We have to nip this in the bud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to get kids treatment early. We know this amendment will do it. Men who have experienced violence in their families as children are twice as likely to become perpetrators themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This amendment will also, for the first time, fund a competitive grant program for nonprofit organizations to provide community services to teens and young adult victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. We know girls and young women between age 16 and 24 have the highest rate of intimate partner violence. Teens need to learn at an early age about healthy relationships. This amendment will help that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment also ensures that we can track crimes against American Indian and Alaska Native women through a national tribal sex offender registry. This is a place where we have been lacking resources in the tribes. One out of every three American Indian and Alaska Native women are victims of sexual assault on reservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, every State has a sexual offender registry, but crimes against native women are rarely entered. We need to pass this to fix that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we know that this epidemic of domestic violence affects every State and community. We know that these VAWA programs can help break the cycle, and we know that we've authorized these programs, but we have not appropriated a dime for them. We have done this with some other new programs in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have carefully selected four programs. This has the wide support of groups across the country who have selected these four programs as the highest priorities of those programs that have been authorized but not appropriated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chair's done a good job with limited resources, but we hope that we can extend this effort and these authorized programs to nip and end this circle of violence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>First of all, I want to thank Mr. Inslee for introducing this amendment. I'm very proud to cosponsor it with you. It's very needed, and the reason I know it's very needed is because the things you talked about I experienced as a boy. I won't be redundant and go into the things that you have mentioned and the reasons why this program is so necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do want you to know that I don't normally support changing money from one area to another like from the Department of Justice to these programs, but this is one of the most urgent needs in America, and it's been like this for the last 50 to 60 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can remember when we went to police headquarters with my mother after we'd been beaten and my father had beaten my mother, and the police sergeant said, If you don't get these kids home, I'm going to have you arrested for child abuse. That's the way it was in those days. There was no place for a woman to hide, and the children had to experience this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 4 o'clock in the morning, when you hear your mother being beaten and you come down the stairs and your hair is standing straight up on the back of your head and your father turns and says to you, If you don't get back up the stairs, you're going to get some of this, kids should not have to endure that. They should not ever have to endure that. And the women who are treated like that should never have to endure that as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a shame that there aren't more people talking about this because this is something that's an urgent, urgent need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Inslee's absolutely right about the chances for a child who's been abused like this to do the same things throughout the rest of their life. I was very fortunate that didn't happen, but I've known a lot of people who experienced that who did, and I think it's a tragic thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We really need to find a way to get these women and kids into shelter and away from these abusive parents, fathers and sometimes mothers, and we need to help the women who are abused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he just said, in the Native American community, there are women who are being raped and beaten, and there's really no place for them to turn. There's no registry so we can track these guys. That's a horrible thing to have to experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just want to say to my colleagues, and as I said, I won't be redundant, but I was reading in our information that we use when we discuss these issues, I was reading that between 3.3 million and 10 million children witness domestic violence every year. Can you imagine, up to 10 million kids that witness domestic violence in the home and elsewhere every single year? That's unforgivable. And at one time, in 1 day, one 24-hour period, there were 18,000 children in the United States that received  services and support because they were experiencing domestic violence, in one day. That's something, in my opinion, that's inexcusable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very, very important piece of legislation. I would urge all of my colleagues to vote for this. There should not be one negative vote on this, not one, because there are kids and women who are suffering, sometimes every day. Sometimes the husband will beat the child and they'll turn around to the wife and say, I'll never do that again, and he does it the next week. Sometimes he'll beat his wife and he puts his arms around her, and I've seen this firsthand, he says, Honey, I will never  do that again. And the next week she's beaten again, and she sometimes has no place to go and she feels like there's no hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's extremely important that we give these women and these kids hope,  and that's why I say to you, Mr. Inslee, thank you very much for introducing this amendment. I hope it passes unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and first of all, I want to acknowledge the compelling story of the gentleman from Indiana. That's truly moving. There's no two ways about it, and that's why we have this program, and that's why the subcommittee and the full committee strongly supported funding for VAWA and all of these grant programs, acknowledging at the same time that there are additional grant programs authorized under VAWA that have not received funding.  We look forward to working on those, and this one in particular, as we move forward through conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me suggest to the body that we would love to increase funding for programs like this, the Violence Against Women Act Programs. There's more compelling argument for it, particularly as described.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me note, however, for the record that we have increased VAWA funding to $430 million. We rejected the President's proposal to shrink the grant program, actually to eliminate these individual grant programs, and to have a bloc grant program. We have continued to fund the various categories, and we certainly look forward to considering other authorized grant programs that are not currently funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We funded, at $430 million, VAWA programs, a $60 million increase over the President's request, and $47 million over the 2007 funding level. That is a sizeable increase to this very worthy program, not that there couldn't be more. So I can't argue for one second to either of my colleagues against adding funding to VAWA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real point is that we have significantly increased that funding because we share the concerns of the gentlemen who have spoken here, and I hope that we can all understand and agree with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are again targeting offsets in a general administration account. A $14 million cut to the Department of Justice general administration account will require layoffs. And let me just put this in perspective. We've already had a $30 million cut to this account. We're down from $104 million in Department of Justice general administration to $74 million, and we're looking at another $14 million cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At some point, everybody has to appreciate that there has to be some money in these administrative accounts to administer these programs that we all care about, and we have to get real about this process. This is obviously a very strong and passioned expression of support for the programs we've authorized to prevent violence against women, and we're all working in that venue. The committee did it by increasing the funding by $60 million over the President's request, almost $50 million over last  year. You're doing it here today by adding another $14 million. And we can't argue with the merit of that sentiment, but we can express concern and try to bring some reality to the offset suggested here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are cutting Department of Justice general administration accounts below the level in which they can effectively operate and administer the very programs which we are increasing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, reluctantly, I oppose the amendment. At the same time, I do look forward to working with the gentlemen, no matter what the outcome of the amendment, as the process moves forward.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Sec. 214. For "Office of Justice Programs--STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE" for the Law Enforcement Tribute Act program, as authorized by section 11001 of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (Public Law 107-273), and the amount otherwise provided by this title for "General Administration--SALARIES AND EXPENSES" is hereby reduced by, $1,000,000.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400630" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which would provide $1 million in funding for the Law Enforcement Tribute Act Program. This program provides one-time grants to help State and local governments complete permanent tributes that honor law enforcement and public safety officers who have been killed or seriously injured in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are currently 17,917 names engraved on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC, including 928 from my home State of Illinois. But many communities also want to honor their law enforcement heroes with local memorials or permanent tributes. The Law Enforcement Tribute Act Program provides support to States and localities to help them do this. Without this support, many communities would not be financially able to provide these worthy tributes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Law Enforcement Tribute Act Program was authorized in fiscal year 2002 at $3 million per year, but no funding has been appropriated since 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, this Chamber approved a similar amendment by voice vote when I offered it with Representatives Adam Schiff and Tom Davis. Unfortunately, that amendment, like the appropriations bill it was included in, never became law. Today, we have an opportunity to once again approve funding that will help communities honor all of those local heroes who have given so much to protect us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment has the strong support of law enforcement groups all over the country, including the National Association of Police Organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, law enforcement and public safety officers dedicate their career and their lives to protecting us. Tributes provide us with a constant reminder of the sacrifices that they have made. The least we can do is help local communities honor these brave men and women.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is focused on the education activities at NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Specifically, the amendment designates $70.7 million of NASA's $220.3 million for education appropriations for the minority workforce preparation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program has been in action before. It was a good program, but because of the cuts that NASA did suffer, it was defunded actually, as they rearranged the funding. I thank the committee for the increase that they did make and commend their recognition of the importance of education funding for NASA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of us know that this is the focus of education, now, trying to make sure we have workforce available so that we can maintain the competitive edge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NASA had proposed to spend about $40 million, or 27 percent, of its education budget on minority university research and education programs, commonly called the Hispanic-Serving Institutions, as well as the Historically Black Institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the program includes Partnership Awards for Integration of Research, the Space Science Collaboration, the Math Science Teacher and Curriculum Enhancement Program, the Undergraduate Scholars program, Network  Resource and Training Sites, Model Institutes for Excellence and the Earth Science Collaborations program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that since only 2 percent of our Nation's engineers are African American and Hispanic, we really do need to encourage them to be in this part of the workforce. It's critically important to support these Federal programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge adoption, although I would like to have a colloquy with the chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady. I think this amendment is one more expression of a number one concern about the attention that education is getting in our various science accounts. We have attempted very diligently, pointedly, to address that by increasing funding in education accounts across the bill. This account, the NASA account, first of all, we broke it out as a separate account and then increased it by $66.6 million for a total of $220 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that the gentlelady is reaching out to NASA, NASA should be listening. Universities, education, K-12, they want NASA.

    <paragraph>I really appreciate having this opportunity to talk with you, and I commend your work on putting this very strong legislation together that includes important increases for science and technology programs, as well as law enforcement, among many other things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to discuss with you just for a moment my concerns for funding and oversight in this bill for the United States Trade Representative. Now, many of my colleagues have been pretty vocal, since the beginning of this Congress, in expressing our concerns with our current trade policy and its harmful effects on our families and communities. A large part of this is what I see as a lack of responsibility by the USTR in promoting exports to other nations and protecting American workers and businesses  against unfair trade practices against other nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was going to offer a number of amendments here today dealing with increasing USTR funding, specifically for oversight and enforcement of our trade laws, but I appreciate the increase in funding in the bill for the ITC, but I believe so much more needs to be done. Instead of fixing the many problems we have with our current policies, whether it's our current record trade deficit or the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs, the USTR has, instead, focused efforts on enacting more flawed trade  agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems as if, instead of working to make our trade agreements better, the administration and the USTR have focused on joining with private interests and using USTR funding to lobby Congress. I believe we must rein this in, what I see as an improper and excessive lobbying by USTR of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I was hoping to offer an amendment on that here today as well, I hope that this Congress will take a closer look at their activities in the future. I strongly believe that we have a responsibility to stand up and tell the USTR that they must start working for American businesses and workers, rather than continue current policies that cost jobs here at home and have decimated our manufacturing base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I would have hoped that we could have done more on this bill to move USTR in that direction to be more responsive to the responsibility to the American people and to the workers in my district, rather than foreign governments and large corporations, I am happy to be here and am supportive of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the opportunity to share this with you and look forward to working with you in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the gentlelady for bringing this issue to our attention. I want her to know that the House knows she knows something about basic industry in America. She knows something about the challenges of transitioning economies, and she knows something about the importance of USTR trying to protect the very best interests of American citizens and American workers working in all sectors of the economy. From my perspective, I am particularly concerned about those  workers in basic industry, in extraction-related industries in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of us have concerns about the USTR and the Trade Representative's actual commitment to representing the very best interests of those sectors of our economy. As we transition into an increasingly international economic community, we have to be cognizant of the impacts of a trade policy that is precipitous to the point of creating real chaos and tremendous hardship, particularly in those sectors of the economy that I represent and that I know the gentlelady is particularly sensitive to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we need to provide oversight of the USTR as we encourage them to enforce our trade laws and to be aggressive advocates, advocates for our best interests as they approach our trading partners and trade negotiations. They should be looking at issues to balance and level the playing field, such as insisting that trade agreements include environmental laws that we have correctly imposed upon our industry and our manufacturing processes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incorporating those regulations into the manufacturing process is expensive. Our competitors around the world, many of them, particularly in the developing countries, don't have those costs. Where we have incorporated health and safety regulations in the workplace, statutorily imposed, that has cost money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USTR needs to be sensitive to that. The administration needs to be sensitive to that. It needs to incorporate those kinds of public interest concerns as they negotiate trade agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Why? Because we have done it, and we are their competitors. We are a country with a higher standard of living, and if we can't level the playing field with regard to regulatory activity, then we will never be able to begin to be competitive with our competitors from developing nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me again compliment the gentlelady for being focused on this very early in her career, being a champion for the working people, and for the best interests of our trade policy generally in all sectors of the economy, and for bringing this to our attention in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can assure her that we will be sensitive in large part because of the concerns that she expresses here today. Thank you very much, Ms. Sutton, for bringing that to our attention.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400229" topic="CROSS-AGENCY SUPPORT PROGRAMS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, a few hundred miles above us the astronauts of Expedition 15 work around the clock on board the international space station. Their efforts have just been boosted by delivery of a huge new power element from the space shuttle Atlantis crew. The Atlantis astronauts, working with station crew mates, brought the orbiting base ever closer to completion and a whole new era of living and working in space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The international space station is a remarkable achievement of global cooperation now entering its most critical period. Over the next 3 years, more than a dozen flights of the space shuttles Atlantis, Discovery, and Endeavor will complete assembly that began in 1998. The completed station will be home to a crew of six astronauts and generation-spanning research that will reach into the lives of every American family. Yes, completion and operation of the international  space station is that important to America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am fortunate to represent one of the most enduring and important NASA facilities, the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and have had the honor over my five terms in Congress to work with dedicated and amazing people at the Johnson Space Center. Their passion and commitment to space exploration led me to introduce the Space Exploration Act of 2002. I introduced the Space Exploration Act as a challenge to this country and the leaders in Congress and the White House to offer a vision and concrete  goals for the human space flight program after the international space station. Many here on this floor joined me in that call to action, to invest in a space exploration vital for the future of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, President Bush announced a similar plan, the Vision for Space Exploration. The President's vision outlined a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond. I fully supported the President in pushing for an expanded mission for NASA. But in the years that have followed, this Nation has seen rhetoric not supported by action. The administration's vision for space and subsequent authorized funding limits have consistently been ignored, and the  President's yearly budget does not fund a robust vision for NASA's future. As a result, we now see a widening gap in the period of time between the retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 and the next generation Crew Exploration Vehicle and Crew Launch Vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This gap will impede access to the station for our astronauts in the years immediately following the shuttle's retirement. During that period, before the new Orion and Ares space vehicles are operational, NASA and America will be totally reliant upon Russia for access to the space station by our astronauts and to carry cargo into space. We will be forced to spend more money than could ever be spent to accelerate arrival of our new space vehicles. This year alone, the administration worsened that  gap by making its budget request some $1.4 billion below the congressionally authorized level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adding to the strain, millions of dollars have been shifted from the station and shuttle accounts to pay for repairs made necessary by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita which damaged NASA facilities in New Orleans, the Mississippi gulf coast, and Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NASA now faces the stark reality that the timeline for next-generation human space exploration is becoming increasingly hard to meet. We as a Congress must do more to ensure viability of NASA space exploration programs. And I stand here not to criticize the past efforts of the President or previous Congresses, but to call on leaders of both parties to help us meet and even exceed the funding levels required to continue all the important projects in NASA's orbit. As this bill goes to conference,  I believe we can find additional resources for NASA to reduce the widening gap between the shuttle and the Orion and Ares programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, now is not the time to trim our sails into space. I join with the heroes of the space program, past and present, our Nation's industry leaders, and other forward-looking supporters to urge our colleagues to fund NASA fully into the coming years at the amount authorized by Congress. In today's global competition, there is no substitute for keeping America first in outer space.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Sec. 701. (a) Of the amounts made available for "STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE" for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, $15,000,000 shall be available for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force program, as authorized by title IV of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5771 et seq.).</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Mollohan for all of his work on this bill, and I appreciate your commitment to all the missing children's programs. It is very important. And I know that you are equally disturbed by the prevalence of Internet crimes against our children. And the numbers certainly don't lie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's CyberTip Line, the number of reports relating to the online enticement of children for sexual acts increased by 139 percent between 2005 and 2006. Over the same period, there was a 194 percent increase in the number of reports related to unsolicited obscene material sent to a child on the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly more can and must be done. And this problem is not regional; it is not isolated to big cities or rural  communities. This is a real national problem that will not go away unless we can expand our capabilities of our law enforcement, which is exactly what my amendment will do by increasing the funding for the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Internet Crime Against Children Task Force, or ICAC, plays a very critical role in protecting our children on the Internet. The ICAC Task Force's mission is clear: to help State and local government enforcement agencies develop an effective response to cyber-enticement and child pornography cases. This help involves forensic and investigative support training and technical assistance, victims services, and community education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would carve out $15 million out of the Justice Assistance account's Missing Children Program for the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force. It would also carve out $15 million out of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program for the ICAC Task Force. Both accounts were used in fiscal year 2007 to fund the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force at $26 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I certainly understand the problems that having to do with this amendment, so I am certainly willing to withdraw my amendment if the chairman and ranking member are willing to work toward an increase in funding for the Internet Crime Against Children Task Force in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentlelady yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlelady is really at the forefront of this issue. She is co-chair of the 131 Member strong Congressional Missing and Exploited Children Caucus. She is to be commended for that. She has worked with me, she has worked with Mr. Frelinghuysen, she has worked with the committee. To some extent she can declare success because she is tenacious in getting additional funding for Missing Children's programs. She has been successful in increasing funding 100 percent, you could argue, since  the President asked for no funding here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we would like to point out that in response to her and the caucus's expressions of concern to the committee, we have funded the Missing Children's program account to the tune of $61.4 million, which is $14 million above the 2007 enacted funding level. That is in large part because of her efforts, and we do appreciate it. She should declare success, and she should be proud of that. She is, as I say, tenacious. And speaking for myself, and Mr. Frelinghuysen who I know shares this interest,  we look forward to working with her as we move forward. She is representing this caucus here today, and we look forward to trying to even increase this amount of money as we go to conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank her for her efforts and for helping the committee as we have marked up our bill and funded this account.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I would thank the gentleman for his kind words. And I bring this up to just enforce the importance of missing children, the caucus and the task force, tonight, because every problem is increasing so much, as I said earlier. The problems that we used to have, we are seeing many more problems with the use of the Internet, with just what is happening to children in this day and age. And the more that we can do to prevent online enticement, to prevent children being  sexually assaulted, all of the tragedies that are happening right now. So I appreciate that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to talk briefly on the Poe-Costa-Moore amendment. As stated in the amendment, this is a bipartisan amendment. And I want to thank the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Kansas for their support for crime victims under this amendment and the VOCA fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The VOCA fund was established under the Reagan administration. It's a novel concept where criminals who are convicted of crime pay fees into a fund that goes to victims of crime. It's kind of like criminals pay the rent on the courthouse, as they should. And so this fund has been established to supply victims and victims services throughout the country necessary funds for those victims and those projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this present time, the fund is up to $1.3 billion. But this year the fund is capped at $625 million for victims services and victims throughout the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is asking that 10 million more dollars be applied to this fund because of two reasons: Unfortunately, there are more crime victims in the United States than there ever have been. And also, by necessity, there are more programs that are victims services than ever have been in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 4,400 different programs and agencies receive funding under the VOCA fund. Over 3 million victims receive funds from this fund every year. And this covers the gamut, from sexual assault victims to child victims, to robbery victims and victims and families of homicide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These funds are needed for these families. But they're also needed for domestic violence shelters. They're needed for child assessment centers. Those are centers throughout the United States that take sexually exploited children and help them through the process; not only the medical process, not only the psychological process, but the criminal justice system as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 26 organizations that support an additional $10 million for this crime victims fund, because it is necessary to help victims throughout the United States. So under this amendment, we're asking for 10 million additional dollars taken from human resources that would be applied to crime victims organizations throughout the United States and money for crime victims. This money, as I stated, is necessary. Unfortunately, it is necessary to help victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Crime Victims Caucus, and my cochair Mr. Costa, and other Members like Mr. Moore from Kansas, we all support this additional funding for crime victims. Take it and place it where it is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a novel concept to allow people who violate the law to contribute to a constant fund, and we want that to continue, but this year there needs to be 10 million additional dollars contributed to that fund so that numerous organizations that provide specifically victims services that funding has been cut in the past will be allowed to continue those victims services in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>List of Organizations Who Support the Poe-Costa-Moore Amendment</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American Probation and Parole Association; American Society of Victimology; Break the Cycle; Jewish Women International; Justice Solutions; Legal Momentum; Mothers Against Drunk Driving; National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards; National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators; National Center for Victims of Crime; National Children's Alliance; and National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, again, not because of the intended purpose of the gentleman trying to do good here and getting additional resources into the crime victims fund. That's worthy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's being authorized at $625 million, this amendment would raise it to $635 million. And you might ask, if there are additional resources, why don't we disperse all of them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that's because that fund has to be managed to ensure that there's a source of funds that will remain available for the program despite the inconsistent levels of the criminal fees that are deposited there annually. So part of that is trying to manage the account to assure stability year in and year out so that funds will be available for victims to be paid out according to the authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to point out that the gentleman's offset draws from an account that has been drawn from in the past, and it is the offset is in Commerce. We started out at $58.6 million at the beginning of the day. We've had a $25 million cut, a $10 million cut. This cut would take us down to $23 million, if my math is right. But if my math is not precisely right, my point should be taken that we've gone from $58.6 million down to approximately $23 million in this S&amp;E account. That's a 60 percent  reduction. There is going to be nobody left to administer these programs. And that's why we have to think very carefully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And actually, folks coming here and offering amendments go through the same difficult exercise that the subcommittee and the full committee have gone through. How do you apportion funds when I would argue, the allocation is not adequate to fund all the worthy projects and to fund all of the people who need to administer the worthy projects in this bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 60 percent cut the gentleman's amendment would effect in this S&amp;E account, it simply cannot stand. So for that reason, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment because I believe we  should respect state authority in regards to medical marijuana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like my constituents, I believe that doctors should be permitted to prescribe marijuana for patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, spastic disorders, and other devastating diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people that I represent from Marin and Sonoma counties have made it clear that they want doctors to be permitted to prescribe marijuana for their patients suffering from debilitating diseases, and I believe that the Federal Government must not stand in the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this amendment because it would stop the Justice Department from punishing those who are abiding by their state's law. Please join me in supporting this important amendment so that those who suffer from debilitating diseases can continue to get relief without the fear of federal interference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government should get its priorities straight--and stop going after fully licensed physicians and their patients instead of the real criminals.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The point of order is reserved.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400660" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as a former sheriff of King County in Seattle, Washington, and a member of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, I am proud to offer this amendment along with my colleague from Connecticut, Congressman Murphy, to provide $5 million to fully fund the Court Training and Improvements Program, offset from the Department of Commerce departmental management salaries and expenses account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Court Training and Improvements Program enhances our courts' ability to keep victims of domestic and sexual abuse safe and to hold offenders accountable. It was authorized early last year as a part of the Violence Against Women Act but has not yet been funded. Mr. Chairman, this program must be funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spent 33 years of my life working in law enforcement, and during that time I walked into many unpredictable domestic violence situations. Responding to a domestic violence call is one of the most dangerous calls a police officer can go to. Domestic violence cases have their own unique challenges, and we in law enforcement have had to learn specific strategies for how to deal with those situations. People are physically and mentally harmed and homes are torn apart. I have seen how domestic and  sexual abuse not only affects spouses but the children, the families, and the lives of the entire community. Safe homes and families are the root of a safe society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statistics show that every year almost 1 million incidents of violence occur against current and former spouses, boyfriends, girl friends, and each year nearly 10 million children are exposed to domestic violence. We need to implement and fund every tool at our disposal to combat this terrible problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the key ways to reduce the impact of domestic violence is to ensure that our justice system has the tools to deal with these cases. Too often lives hang in the balance as judges and court personnel make decisions without an understanding of the dynamics of abuse and violence in relationships. Judges themselves have repeatedly cited a need and a desire for specialized knowledge and judicial education regarding sex offenders and victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The desperate need for trained judges and court personnel was recently brought to light in the tragic case of Yvette Cade. On the morning of October 10, 2005, Yvette was doused with gasoline and set on fire by her estranged husband while at work here in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. At the time of the attack, she had a protection order out against him, but a judge had dismissed her protection order 3 weeks before, saying she didn't need it. This judge had likened victims of domestic violence  to buses that come along all the time. Cade's husband was recently sent to prison for attempted murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Better-trained judges are essential if we are to keep victims and children alive and hold abusers and rapists accountable for their behavior. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to improve our courts, protect the victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse, prevent future crimes, and ensure that perpetrators are appropriately punished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. First I would like to thank Chairman Mollohan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a vast improvement on previous efforts to fund domestic violence efforts. It goes a very long way. And we rise today with my colleague Mr. Reichert to simply ask that we fund yet one more important program that has been authorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a child, Mr. Chairman, I remember sitting at home with a baby-sitter while my mother went off to volunteer in a domestic violence shelter, and that memory still stays with me today. Victims of domestic violence require and are entitled to special assistance when dealing with their trauma. However, judges and court personnel need specialized training to deal with these victims in a way that both preserves justice and addresses the severe trauma associated with these crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some States have already put programs in place to deal with the special needs of these domestic violence victims. My home State of Connecticut is amongst those that has been pioneering these types of programs. In the biggest city in my district, Waterbury, we have a program through which law enforcement personnel, prosecutors, family services organizations, probation officers, and domestic violence advocates all review cases together in an effort to reveal more information about the perpetrator  to ensure that victims are protected from further abuse. What makes the Waterbury operation so outstanding is the vertical case management model that should serve as an example to the rest of the country, a model that could be funded under the proposed appropriation in this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Reichert and I are offering this amendment today so that States can have a partner in the Federal Government. Our amendment will fund the Court Improvements Program to train judges and court personnel to better identify and resolve the complex issues involved in domestic violence cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has a responsibility to recognize the unique and horrific nature of domestic violence crimes, and we have done that in the underlying appropriation bill today with a new investment in domestic violence programs. Our amendment today simply seeks to fund yet one more innovative program to make sure that courts, prosecutors, domestic violence advocates, and the victims themselves all have the resources necessary to navigate what can be sometimes a very complex system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I might, for the Department of Commerce here, the S&amp;E account is now down to $18 million if the last two amendments are adopted and you add it to the offsets that were affected by the amendments that have already passed. The Department of Commerce S&amp;E account, they are just going to have to shut down their office again. I would just encourage Members, when they offer these amendments, to get serious about the offsets. And, my goodness, I don't know what would have happened to President Bush's  budget if we had not increased it, because his S&amp;E account would have been really decimated in increasing the Violence Against Women account. We increased VAWA by $60 million over the President's request, $47 million over 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that our colleagues who are offering these amendments are absolutely in the forefront of protecting women. As we oppose these amendments, at the same time we embrace your cause and that that is why we have worked so hard in effecting these funding increases above the President's request. If we had a larger allocation, we would put more money on these accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said all that, and because the offset is so draconian to the Department of Commerce, I will continue to oppose amendments with these negative offsets. If we aren't able to restore  the salaries and administrative accounts to the extent these amendments are successful, the Department of Commerce would have to shut down. That is how, as I have used the word before, cavalier we are being about these offsets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, while I certainly support the cause and the purposes of the programs these amendments are increasing funding for, I have to oppose them because of the offsets and because we don't have enough resources to go around, a point which is demonstrated by the offsets that these amendments are having to resort to.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400229" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we consider today's appropriations bill, we are all mindful of how harmful wasteful government spending is to hardworking American families. In fact, just this morning I was joined by the majority leader and some of my Blue Dog Coalition colleagues to highlight many of the smart, fiscally responsible initiatives our new majority is pursuing in Congress this year. American citizens expect the Congress to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, and when we allow deceptive  fiscal practices to continue in our government, we set a bad example for our Nation and create a reckless blueprint for future spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have introduced this amendment to today's bill, which will clarify guidelines for premium travel by Department of Commerce employees. The Department's Inspector General March 2007 report showed that these guidelines are not being followed or controlled properly. In fact, the report has a specific section entitled "The Department Needs to Tighten Controls, Update Guidance for Premium-Class Travel," and includes very glaring findings, notably numerous instances in which the Department  failed to authorize or approve properly premium-class travel. The report concludes that the two primary reasons for these oversights are outdated policy and poorly implemented internal controls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, Mr. Chairman, there is a simple solution here that can save the taxpayers their hard-earned dollars and continue good government practices, and it is embodied in my amendment. This amendment offers a direct method of guidance by referencing the Code of Federal Regulations 301-10.122 to 10.124 to withhold funds for such premium travel for Department of Commerce employees. A similar amendment applying to Department of State employees was passed by voice vote last year when the House  considered the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to tackle large instances of taxpayer dollar waste and abuse, let's not overlook the small steps that we can take that will help lead the way for good government practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for their attention to this quick and simple way to practice better fiscal responsibility. I ask for support for my amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I've just conferred with the Chair of the subcommittee, and he has asked me to offer it and withdraw it, and we will work on it before we go to conference. So out of my respect for him and the ranking member, of course I will do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just like to say this: In the last 2 years, we have done a little bit more than this for this good cause, and it's something that's helping law enforcement out across the country. And it's not big bucks, it's pretty small. But then again, you've got to work with where you're at. But it does increase law enforcement agencies' access to records on persons who pose a risk to local communities. I can assure you that the law enforcement agencies need this access, as we think about the things  that happen to our children and older folks and so on, to be able to access that good information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with my appreciation, Mr. Chairman, I will ask unanimous consent to withdraw, with looking forward to working on this at a later point.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>If the gentleman has looked at this carefully, we respect his expertise in this area, and we would be interested in visiting with him as we move this to conference and understanding more clearly the justification for an additional increase.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The text of the amendment is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Amendment No. 23 offered by Mr. Gingrey:</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. 701. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be used by the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to pay the compensation of employees of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to test and examine firearms without written and published testing standards.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, BATFE, has been in operation without substantial changes since the days of prohibition, bootlegging and gang violence in the 1920s and 1930s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year the House Judiciary Committee considered legislation that would have introduced real reform to BATFE, updating the agency for the 21st century, although time ran out before Congress could get anything accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One issue of reform I remain particularly concerned about is how BATFE actually tests firearms submitted by law-abiding firearm designers and manufacturers seeking approval to put their product on the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, without written and uniform standards, gun manufacturers are left guessing about which agent will inspect the firearm this week, whether or not they will be able to ship a product out to potential customers, and whether or not BATFE agents might even prosecute someone because of a shipping mistake or a firearm malfunction. So I have introduced legislation called the Fairness in Firearms Testing Act to address this problem, and it requires BATFE, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms  and Explosives, to actually videotape firearms tests for the purpose of general oversight, and encourage the agency to adopt these testing standards. However, the amendment I'm offering today would cut right to the point by withholding funds to BATFE if they do not write and publish these testing standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More specifically, this amendment creates a level playing field for all United States firearm manufacturers who depend on getting a firearm patented and on the market as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, without written procedures, BATFE has literally a free rein to mistreat manufacturers, change their mind after the fact, and leave both manufacturers and customers at a legal and financial disadvantage. In fact, BATFE regulations are so inconsistent that some manufacturers have been threatened with prosecution after receiving written approval for their products from other BATFE personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2002, 85 percent of American firearm manufacturers have been forced to close their doors. Let me repeat that, Mr. Chairman. Since 2002, 85 percent of American firearm manufacturers have been forced to close their doors. There are only 373 licensed firearm inventors and manufacturers left in America. Moreover, with the increase in number of imported firearms purchased by civilians and law enforcement alike, our Nation is at a strategic defensive disadvantage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I realize that the chairman has reserved a point of order, and he will explain that, I'm sure, momentarily, but it's my understanding that if I do agree to withdraw this amendment, that the chairman and the committee will work with me to help bring reforms to the BATFE, including these written standards, to help United States firearm manufacturers. I would be happy to yield to the chairman and to engage in a colloquy with him regarding that. Otherwise, in the absence of an agreement,  then certainly I want to go forward with my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>We would, at that point, talk about the point of order a little more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to be responsive to the gentleman. I have not gotten deeply into his concerns, so I'm not sure exactly where he's coming from on this. But I can commit to him that we're willing to talk about it, we're willing to understand more clearly what his concerns are and in good faith work with him. And if there is an accommodation, we certainly want to make it in good faith. But I certainly cannot telegraph or represent to the gentleman an outcome; I can only promise him the process to work with  him in good faith on this issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I understand exactly what the chairman is saying. I'm not necessarily expecting any hard and fast promises on his behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I didn't mean, Mr. Chairman, for the amendment to catch the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee by surprise in any way, not to be blind-sided or coming up at the last minute. We've had the amendment, we filed the amendment. In fact, I had, Mr. Chairman, introduced legislation pertaining specifically to this effect last year in the 109th Congress, so this amendment basically is a follow-up to that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from West Virginia, the distinguished chairman. I appreciate your spirit of cooperation. And I know there are some concerns about the amendment, I appreciate that. But I welcome your support on this matter, and I look forward  to working with you. Let's discuss it and make sure you understand exactly where I'm coming from in regard to the amendment. I think it makes a lot of sense, and I hope I can convince you of the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, our great country was founded on the recognition of the most basic rights of mankind, that all persons are created equal and endowed by their Creator, with the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Yet for decades this conviction wasn't perfectly realized because of the blight of slavery, which we fought a civil war to end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, this is not just a long-past episode in human history. Human trafficking, frequently referred to as modern-day slavery, is an ugly reality not only in the developing world, but also in the United States. Our country is the destination of thousands of people trafficked for purposes of sexual and labor exploitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between October 2000 and March 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had certified nearly 1,200 victims of human trafficking. As Americans, we must defend the dignity of human life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With my amendment, I propose to designate $2 million of the monies appropriated in this bill for the formation of a task force to combat this barbaric trade coming across our borders in the States of Washington, Idaho and Montana. This task force would join 42 other such task forces nationwide in serving as a cooperative effort between State and local governments, NGOs and compassionate citizens all working together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The northern border of our country is a point of entry for this horrific practice. In 2004, it was estimated there were between 1,500 and 22,000 people trafficked through Canada to the United States, numbers that some observers believe significantly understate the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, however, there are no human trafficking task forces along most of the northern borders of Washington, Idaho and Montana, yet these same States cover more than half of the northern land border of the United States, hundreds of miles of which are extremely rural and rugged, being patrolled only by officers on horseback or even on foot, if patrolled at all. Given the rural nature of these northern borders, opportunities for human trafficking continue, with few resources available to the  many rural communities along the same border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By my amendment, I seek to make $2 million in the DOJ budget available in grant funds to establish the Tristate Task force to provide training and resources to rural communities in Washington, Idaho and Montana to combat human trafficking. This important task force will work to coordinate local efforts to combat modern-day slavery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure goes to the heart of equality, dignity and worth of every person. I ask my colleagues to join me today in the defense of these essential American values and support this amendment.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Sec. 701. None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400178" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am introducing an amendment that is designed to protect States' rights and to provide people across our country in these 12 States that have passed laws authorizing the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes to have access to that medical use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a very simple, very serious proposal. The Constitution of the United States is very clear. It authorizes States' rights in every other area that is not specifically designated to the Federal Government. One of those main areas is health care. The States have the authority to take care of their own people and to make sure that they have access to the best possible health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment is supported by a number of other important organizations across the country, in addition to organizations in those 12 States of Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington that have passed laws authorizing the medicinal use of this product. Two of those States have passed it through their legislatures. The other 10 have passed it by means of referendum. In other words, the people themselves have passed this  in referendum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an amendment that really should be adopted. It doesn't do anything to stimulate any violations of the law. It just says those States ought to be able to determine how to take care of their own people. There are a variety of ways in which that can be done to make sure that they get proper attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman from California.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding and also for his leadership and for continuing to beat the drum on this very, very important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about allowing State governments to provide relief for a small, very important group of people who are suffering from chronic pain or terminal illness. This amendment does not encourage or make legal the recreational use of marijuana. Eleven States, including my home State of California, have legalized medical marijuana, with clear guidelines for doctors' approval before usage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, a constituent from Oakland, Angel Raich, has been diagnosed with more than 10 serious medical conditions, including an inoperable brain tumor. Ms. Raich and others who use medical marijuana are simply trying to relieve their crushing pain while following the guidelines and laws that their doctors and the States have already established. Taxpayer dollars shouldn't be spent on sending seriously or terminally ill patients to jail. Their doctors, not Congress, should decide which drugs  will work best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on this amendment and ensure that patients' rights are upheld. This is the right thing to do. This is the compassionate thing to do. This is about health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from New York again for once again offering this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400178" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I want to make it clear that there are many dozens of organizations that are focused on health care and constitutional rights across the country; not just in those 12 States, but in a lot of other places, as well, who have endorsed this idea and support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They include the American Nurses Association, the American Public Health Association, and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Medical societies all across this country have endorsed this amendment because they know it is in the best interests of people suffering from diseases such as AIDS, cancer, glaucoma and others that can be relieved of pain and suffering and be of assistance in recovering from the debilitating aspects of these diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It simply makes good common sense for us to authorize this amendment. I hope that the majority of the Members in this House of Representatives will now take this opportunity to support good health care for Americans and also support this basic provision of the Constitution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400142" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, not only does this amendment hurt law enforcement's efforts to combat drug trafficking, but it sends the wrong message. Marijuana is the most widely abused drug in the United States. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which is under the jurisdiction of our committee, more young people are now in treatment for marijuana dependency than for alcohol or for all other illegal drugs combined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment does not address the problem of marijuana abuse and possibly makes it worse by sending the message to young people that there can be health benefits from smoking marijuana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our committee received a letter last week from John Walters, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy opposing the gentleman's amendment. He warns of the potential public health impacts of encouraging the unfounded belief that smoking marijuana is a safe and effective medicine, contrary to prevailing expert opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, our own FDA stated: "Smoked cannabis has no acceptable medical use in treatment in the United States," and that no animal or human data supported the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use. Furthermore, the FDA has not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease indication.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that the people who are opposed to this amendment, including the gentleman who just spoke, apparently do not understand what we are doing here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment does not affect States, other than those that have passed laws with respect to medical marijuana, only those 12 States. This amendment would not require or encourage other States to adopt medical marijuana laws. This amendment would not stop law enforcement officials from prosecuting the illegal use of marijuana. This amendment does not encourage drug use in children. Teen use of marijuana has declined in States that have passed medical marijuana laws, and in some of those States  it has declined dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of this amendment is to allow these States to give relief to people suffering from horrific diseases without fearing Federal intervention or prosecution. At stake in this debate is who should be deciding what is best for patients: Should it be the patients themselves, the doctors, or should it be arbitrarily somebody in the Federal Government?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Support this amendment and support States' rights and compassion. Doctors in these 12 States know what is best for their patients. The Federal Government should not stand in their way.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I had a dear friend named Oral James Mitchell, Jr. Oral James Mitchell, Jr., was a Navy SEAL. He fought in Vietnam. Oral James Mitchell, Jr., got pancreatic cancer. He lived in Bethesda, Maryland, a 210-pound strapping man that you would want on your side in a fight, and I have had on my side in a fight, and this country had on its side in a fight in the Vietnam War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he had pancreatic cancer, he smoked marijuana. And his 88-year-old Irish Catholic mother said to me, "Thank God for the marijuana. It is the only thing that makes Oral smile or eat."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I watched that man go down to 115 pounds and die. And Mrs. Mitchell was correct. As he was dying of pancreatic cancer, if he was in a State that made it legal, States' rights say they should have some authority, and Brandeis said States are the laboratories of democracy. And as laboratories of democracy, we ought to experiment and find out if it works and if it is good for people who are dying, if it gives them some relief. If it is glaucoma, if it is cancer, whatever the illness, they should  have that relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask that we not have the Federal Government and DEA infringe on the laws of the States that have had changes in their laws, oftentimes through referenda of their people, and we allow those States to be the laboratories of democracy and not interfere with people who are dying, people who might have given their lives for this country, but who are dying and get some respite and some relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask you to pass this and allow States to have rights and people to have some relief in their dying days.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to say a few words about marijuana. First of all, it does cause cancer. I have seen it. I have seen people with lung cancer, no risk other than they were chronic marijuana smokers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the last time we were debating this bill, I called one of my former colleagues in my medical practice who is an oncologist, I had three oncologists, and I asked him for the latest information on cannabis, or THC. He again informed me this is available in pill form. You can actually get it in pill form. Additionally, it is not a very good antiemetic and not a good appetite stimulator. There are about 18 different products legally available that doctors can prescribe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By and large, most of the people who want to use this want to get high and there are consequences to letting this move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Saying that this State and this State allows this, we need to remember something: States govern where you practice medicine. If I want to practice medicine here, I have got to get a license in the District of Columbia. If I want to open a satellite office, I have got to get a license in Maryland or Virginia. But the Federal Government regulates prescribing, for obvious reasons. If the patient comes in to see me here and lives in Virginia, they are going to go over to a pharmacy there. So the  Federal Government has always regulated this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are significant consequences to making this product widely available, and that is what this amendment will do. This is a very, very bad amendment. Marijuana has been implicated in railroad accidents. It has been implicated in car accidents. It is documented to have an adverse effect on memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeepers, we have people dying in this country from the effects of cigarettes. We have people dying in this country from the effects of alcohol. We have people in this body wanting to ban cigarettes and ban smoking. And now we are going to take action to allow another dangerous substance on the market? And there is an agenda of the people who are behind these kinds of amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They want to legalize marijuana, and they want to make another dangerous product available to our society. I think that this is a bad direction for us to go in. This a bad amendment and a dangerous amendment. I would encourage all of my colleagues to vote "no" on the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment, which would prohibit any funds made available in this act to be used to prevent implementation of legally passed State laws in those 12 States that have authorized the use of marijuana for medical purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Founding Fathers wanted criminal law to be the domain of local and State governments. Sick and infirm people who live in the 12 States that have been granted by the voters in these States the legal right to use marijuana to alleviate their suffering if a doctor agrees, we should not make them targets of prosecution. If the voters in a State have so voted, and a doctor agrees, it is a travesty for the Federal Government to waste scarce Federal resources to harass sick people, elderly cancer  patients and frail, multiple sclerosis sufferers and prevent them from getting the relief their personal doctors have recommended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard here hysterical talk about how voting for this amendment will somehow prevent the Federal Government from being able to go after narcotics traffickers. That is nonsense. The DEA would still have the power to arrest anyone selling marijuana for recreational use, as well as anyone selling cocaine or any other drugs. After all, although related to opium, yes, and even heroin, morphine is already used legally in hospitals throughout the United States. That does not mean that we are  going to open up the whole country to heroin because we allow hospitals to use morphine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether morphine or marijuana, the fact is that Federal resources could be better used and shouldn't be wasted on arresting sick people or their doctors. Those Federal resources, if this amendment passes, can be redirected away from these people, but to major drug traffickers or crime syndicates. That makes a lot more sense than trying to stop somebody or arrest somebody who has a doctor's prescription because they are suffering from cancer treatment. It makes more sense to focus on the drug  dealers, for Pete's sake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in the House there is a wide coalition of Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, and this number has grown year by year, who want to promote State autonomy on this issue. This is what the Founding Fathers wanted. Criminal matters should be left up to the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A vote "yes" on Hinchey-Rohrabacher is a vote to respect the intent of our Founding Fathers and respect the rights of our people at the State level to make the criminal law under which they and their families will live. It reinforces rules surrounding the patient-doctor relationship, and it is in contrast to emotional posturing and Federal power grabs and bureaucratic arrogance, which is really at the heart of the opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a vote for good government. This is a good vote for honest compassion. The legal, humanitarian and practical thing to do is to vote "yes" on this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just note this. I have had personal experiences on this, and I certainly respect Dr. Weldon and his opinion. And I have asked him for his opinion many times for problems of my own. But I lost my mother, and I recently lost my brother, to cancer. I will tell you in both cases there was a loss of appetite and just a pessimism that came over my mother and my brother both. If marijuana would have helped them, and if a doctor would have prescribed it for them, it would have been a  horrible thing to think that Federal agents would come in and try to interfere with that so they would not be able to get marijuana, if that is what their doctor felt would have helped them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what we are deciding today: Is that a right use of resources, number one, to go in and interfere with this doctor-patient relationship? They already use morphine in hospitals. That doesn't interfere with people trying to get control of the sale of heroin on our streets. No, this will not interfere with that. But what this will do is prevent a terrible waste of Federal resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let us note again, if people are sick, and a doctor says yes, this would be a good treatment, I don't think our Founding Fathers, who wanted the State governments to make these criminal laws, but I don't even think that they would have wanted the State governments to interfere in such a relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Founding Fathers believed in individual freedom, and they believed in limited government. Where else but in the doctor-patient relationship should we have a limit on the government coming in and making things criminal matters? I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on the Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in my previous life before coming to Congress, I was a prosecutor in Texas for a long time. Then I was a criminal court judge. Justice is one thing that we should always find in our country, but we don't always find it in our courts, unfortunately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This case that has now become very famous throughout the United States happens to deal with two border agents doing their job. They come in contact with a drug dealer on the violent Texas-Mexico border. The drug dealer bring in a million dollars' worth of drugs in a van. He abandons the drugs and the van, takes off, tries to run back to Mexico, gets in a confrontation with our border agents. Shots are fired. He is shot in the buttocks and disappears into Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Federal Government brings the drug dealer back to the United States and grants him immunity from prosecution of a million dollars' worth of drugs in order to prosecute the border agents who were doing their job. He was given that immunity and testified against the two border agents. They were convicted and sent to a Federal penitentiary for 11 and 12 years. And for the most part of their sentence, which started in January, they have been in solitary confinement, what we reserve normally for  the hardest and meanest and most violent criminals in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It turns out that this drug dealer was not just a mule bringing in drugs to get a little money for his sick mother back in Mexico, but while he was waiting to testify, given immunity, he goes back to Mexico and brings in another load of drugs worth about $800,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Federal prosecutors knew about that second load of drugs, but they insisted that the jury not know about that second load of drugs, and the jury never heard about that second load of drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is relentless prosecution in this case that is chilling the effect of our border agents on the border to do their job, which is to enforce the rule of law, to arrest drug dealers. Our Federal Government had the choice to prosecute two border agents that violated  policy, or a drug dealer bringing in a million dollars' worth of drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, you would think that public policy would say we would go after drug dealers. But no, our Federal prosecutors went after the border agents. We still don't know why they were so relentless in that prosecution, but they were. So tonight, while we are here, we have two border agents serving time in the penitentiary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment simply tries to right a wrong. It requires that no funds be used to incarcerate either one of these two border agents, Ramos and Compean, any further, and that they can be released from custody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost everyone agrees that the punishment is way out of line. Even the prosecutor said that once. Last week the Senate held hearings on the prosecution of this case in a bipartisan manner and said that these sentences were way out of line. And so this amendment will simply allow no Federal funds to be used to incarcerate these two border agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hopefully the House will continue to have hearings on why these two agents and other border agents have been prosecuted by the Western District of Texas while ignoring other violations of the law by drug dealers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that my fellow colleagues on both sides of the aisle would agree to support this amendment and to allow the release of these two individuals, and not allow any Federal funds to be used to incarcerate two men who were simply doing their job for the rest of us on the violent Texas border.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400089" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, every American is born with an innate sense of fairness and what is right and wrong. This case, more than any other, has struck a chord among Americans as being fundamentally unjust and flat wrong; that two law enforcement officers who swore an oath to protect this Nation, who were out on that violent Texas-Mexico border to protect this Nation against criminals and terrorists, every American understands the case where the two Border Patrol agents doing their job are  thrown in prison for 11 and 12 years, and the drug smuggler goes free with a visa to pass back and forth as often as he wants. And the drug smuggler sues us, the taxpayers, for millions of dollars. Every American gets that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have never seen a level of outrage among my constituents and really across the country on any issue as there has been on this issue of freeing Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is patently unfair these two men, whatever you may say about the circumstances of the case, if they improperly picked up shell casings, they did not report the shooting, it is an administrative violation. At most you fire them from their job. But to be sentenced to 10 to 12 years in prison, these two law enforcement officers, to be sentenced to prison for 10 to 12 years is an outrage. It is just, it is unfair. The drug smuggler to this day is free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Judge POE said, the drug smuggler ran another load of dope into the United States, and the DEA knew about it during the trial of this case. This guy ran more drugs into the United States, and the prosecutor ordered the DEA not to arrest him and let him go free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every American understands this case. People may not have understood the Nigerian oil barge transfer and the Enron case; everybody gets this one. And the Congress, I am very proud to stand here tonight with many, many other Members of Congress who have asked the President first to pardon these two officers. And now that they are in prison and have suffered so much and have lost everything, many of my colleagues, who you will hear speak, have joined together in writing a letter and asking the  President, and we reiterate that call tonight, Mr. Chairman, asking the President to commute the sentences of two Border Patrol agents, Ramos and Compean, for the same reason that he commuted the case of Scooter Libby.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the case of Scooter Libby, the President said the sentence did not fit the crime. Certainly that is true here. If they picked up shell casings and didn't report the shooting, you don't go to prison for 10 and 11 years. In the case of Scooter Libby, the President said Scooter Libby had already suffered enough. Clearly these two Border Patrol agents have already suffered enough. They have lost everything. Their lives have been destroyed. They have been thrown in prison. It is just simply wrong  for their incarceration to continue another day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For whatever reason, the White House is turning a deaf ear on the call of the American people, the overwhelming outrage of the American people to have these two men released from prison. So what other choice do we have, Mr. Chairman, as Members of Congress, but to cut off the funding to the Bureau of Prisons to incarcerate them? We cannot as Members of Congress send a stronger signal to the White House and to the American people how committed we are to protecting this border and standing behind  our law enforcement agents, and letting the Border Patrol agents know that we are proud of them and support the work that they are doing for the sake of our children and for the sake of our constituents. We understand clearly that we will never win the war on terror until we have truly protected our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The border today is unprotected and wide open. If you cross in Arizona, you won't even be arrested the first 15 times you cross over. You're going to be put right back across the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you cross in Brownsville, an agent told us on a trip just a couple of weeks ago, Brownsville will only arrest an illegal alien if they come up and knock on the window of the vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But yet, right next door in Del Rio, thank God Del Rio is arresting everybody. In Del Rio, using existing law and existing resources, Federal Judge Alia Ludlum, Border Patrol Sector Chief Randy Hill are arresting every single illegal alien crossing the border in Del Rio. They have zero tolerance for illegal aliens crossing in Del Rio. The local community loves it because it keeps the streets safe, the schools safe, the business community thriving. The illegal crossings have plummeted, burglaries  have plummeted, and the result in Del Rio is peace and quiet. Yet, right next door in Brownsville there's chaos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, we all of us have a stake as Americans. In winning the war on terror, you've got to secure the border. No better way to secure the border than enforce existing law, and the best way to make sure that our agents out there in the field know that they're going to have the support of the American people is for the President to step up and commute the sentences of these two border patrol agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until that happens, it is up to us here in Congress to do all that we can to send a message to every border patrol agent that we're doing everything within our power, officers of the law, to support you, to tell you we're proud of you. You are in front lines of the war on terror on the border, just as our soldiers are in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the Members of the House to support Mr. Poe's amendment so we can stop the funding of the incarceration of these two agents and send as strong as possible a message to the White House and, frankly, also to every law enforcement agent in the field that we're proud of you and that we want you to protect our border.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Well, with Mr. Culberson speaking on this issue with such knowledge, he's a member of our subcommittee and I respect his knowledge of border issues so much that I approach this debate with fear and trembling. I know that he is passionate about this issue as he has talked with me about it before, in addition with the other border issues that I'm totally serious he is nigh an expert on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, Mr. Chairman, I have to rise in opposition to this amendment for a number of reasons, but principally, let's get our jobs straight here. We're article I. We're the legislature. We pass the laws. We appropriate the dollars, and then the executive branch, of course they administer, and it goes on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the executive branch is article III, and the executive branch takes  these criminal cases and they process them. I heard some really excellent defense summary arguments here before juries in support of this amendment. I cannot imagine a body less capable, less appropriate to adjudicate the issues surrounding the incarceration, conviction, prosecuting of the cases against these two gentlemen than the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, it is a very serious issue, and if we were to act as a jury, we ought to be sitting here. And look around and we're not, not very many of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But secondly, it's not at all the appropriate forum. So we really shouldn't even be taking this up. This is a limitation amendment on an expenditure of funds to incarcerate two individuals who have been processed, due process arguably, and have had a very unfavorable result so far as they are concerned. This issue ought to be resolved in the courts surely, or if the President of the United States wanted to take it up, he has the power that we don't have, to my knowledge. He has a pardoning power.  We don't have that here, but in effect, we are attempting to act as if we did here with these two amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I don't even begin to speak to the merits of the cases, and some folks have spoken to the merits of the cases here. I don't have the facts to argue the case, but I do know this is a particularly inappropriate forum and a particularly inappropriate and imperfect process by which to address these gentlemen's grievances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in opposition to the amendment. I trust the body will recognize the merit of the arguments that I'm making, because I think they're sound, and will likewise oppose these amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400394" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in fact, this is not a unique situation, unique to the extent that the House has not acted before in a criminal case of this nature, but in fact, the House has acted in the past to intervene in cases where we have determined that the outcome was something we did not agree with. We've done it. We've stripped courts of certain abilities to actually hear cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, we've actually passed legislation to change or overturn cases. One was, of course, the case of the Ten Commandments. Another one was, I believe, Congressman BERNIE SANDERS at the time passed a bill to overturn a case with regard to pension funds. So it is not unique that we would be doing this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my only point is that we have the power to define jurisdictions for the courts. It's in the Constitution. We don't have power to adjudicate the guilt or innocence of two individuals.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400394" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, it is again not the position that we are taking here that we are, in fact, changing the decision of the court in regard to their guilt or innocence. We are saying that the punishment handed down is far in excess of what it is they may have done wrong, and that is something I think that we have the absolute ability and right to do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two gentlemen have served now 190 days, 180 days, something, already in prison, and for what? I mean, the most significant thing that we can actually determine, even according to some of the discussions that have been held and some of the statements that have been made by the prosecuting attorney, they're sorry. They made mistakes in terms of maybe using the type of prosecution that would require this kind of penalty. They have even said this may have been the wrong thing to do. Members  of the jury have indicated that if they had seen all of the information now provided to them they would not have voted this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it isn't an issue of the facts of the case so much as it is whether or not we believe these people have actually spent enough time in jail, have they been punished according to the crime. And I would suggest to the gentleman that if you look at this case carefully, certainly that is the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The person that brought this stuff through, the individual that actually was the drug dealer, he is walking free. I have visited Mr. Ramos in prison after he was severely beaten in his cell. They attacked him in his cell, of course, because they found out he was a Federal agent, and I went down there and visited him. You cannot imagine how, in a way, heartbreaking it is to see this guy in the orange jumpsuit, in shackles, and knowing that he is being deprived of the comfort of his own family,  as is Mr. Compean, and here's a drug dealer that's going free in the meantime. It is absolutely incredible. This is a travesty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have begged the President to please become involved with this, please pardon, please commute. He has chosen not to. This is the only option we have open to us, and that is why we are doing what we're doing tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yes, to some extent, I understand that it is not a common practice here, but I think the situation is not an ordinary situation where we have two people who have sworn to defend and protect this country. They are in jail. They have served enough time; that's what we are saying. They have served enough time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please adopt the Poe-Tancredo-Hunter amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I commend the sentiments of the gentleman who's bringing forth this amendment. I don't for a second do anything but think that that's laudable, and I make no judgment about the merits of this case. As the gentleman describes the merits in the favor of these gentlemen, they're powerful. I mean, it sounds like the equities are running all in their favor. I make no comment on that at all because I don't know the facts. And I have read about it, and it does make one sympathetic  based upon the facts as you cited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I don't make any judgments about that. I just oppose it because I don't think this is the right forum. The President, of course, would be an appropriate forum, but that's the only basis of my concern about the amendment. So I commend the gentleman for bringing the issue to the House.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I didn't come here to speak on this issue. I've certainly, I think like most Members of Congress, been following the sensation that television and others have made of this issue. But in the debate, I just wanted to share a couple of things that I've observed as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security and as Member of Congress who spent several days traveling all along the border with the Border Patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was very interesting because I ran into a lot of people that had been detained. I speak Spanish and was able to interview many of the people that were detained, and we don't really get into the day-to-day administration of the detention, release and so on. What was very interesting and kind of surprising to me, because this case has been argued in the media and certainly here on the floor, I was a little bit shocked by the last speaker who indicated that this is not a matter of facts. It is  a matter of facts, and I think that we don't always deal with the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out that the drug dealer, the person that was shot in this case, was released. Did you know that the U.S. Attorney's office does not prosecute anybody who brings less than $5,000 worth of drugs across the border, less than $5,000? A lot of those marijuana packs that the smugglers carry are determined to be less than $5,000, and so nobody who is essentially  a mula is arrested, arrested but not detained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also, when we detain people, we give them the option, Do you understand you're now arrested? You have the right to a trial by jury as anybody in this country would have a right to unless you waive it. And 99.9 percent of everybody waives that and, therefore, gets released to their country of origin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this catch-and-release is not unusual. In fact, it's the norm, and the fact that this gentleman wasn't prosecuted for his drug record is of other facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What really struck me, and I'm just sharing, this is anecdotal information, but I think this amendment and the Congress bringing this up, in my opinion, is an abuse of power. Why? Because if, indeed, and I don't know the sentencing of these border patrolmen, but I know that there is a process if these sentences are extreme, you can appeal those. We have a sentencing commission, and the courts certainly review that. And so I think there is a remedy within our justice system to appeal where the  sentences are too harsh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here's the thing that's most interesting to me. I didn't find one single member of the Border Patrol that supported these two people that had been arrested, who had been convicted by trial of law. So, on this floor, you're making them out as national heroes. They were convicted in a court of law in the United States for wrongdoing, and I think that, as the chairman has indicated, that it is not wise for the Congress to second-guess and make this a sensational case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've visited high school friends who were convicted of drug issues in prison, and I sympathize with everything that people say about these gentlemen, about their families and about the situation of being incarcerated. But I'm also concerned as a Member of Congress that we ought not to override the jurisprudence system that we've established in this country, and that I do think that the remedies in law lie in a court of law, and therefore, this amendment is not appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400191" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me explain why this case is different from all the rest. This is an extraordinary case. It's a case which, even if you accept the drug dealer's word and all of his testimony as fact, finds results in not only the Members who have sponsored this amendment, Mr. Poe, Mr. Tancredo, myself, Mr. Rohrabacher, Mr. Culberson and many others, that list should be extended to about 1 million ordinary Americans who now know the basic facts  of this case, having been laid out in hearings in the other body and soon to be laid out in hearings here, because these gentlemen have been given murder verdicts. They have been given time in excess of the average convicted murderer in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's what makes this case so extraordinary, along with the facts that attend the way evidence was kept from the jury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just explain this extraordinary case, this case in which the so-called victim was moving close to $1 million of drugs across the border, was shot, was wounded, was brought back into the United States, given immunity to testify against these two Border Patrol agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet after he had been given immunity, and presumably had told the U.S. attorney that in exchange for that immunity he would not continue to move narcotics, he was connected with another massive case of moving almost another $1 million of drugs across the border. That information was never communicated to the court, even though the testimony of that drug dealer is the testimony that sent both these agents to the penitentiary for, essentially, murder sentences; that is, 11 and 12 years respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly the U.S. Government at that point had an obligation to go to the court and tell the court that, indeed, the credibility of their key witness had been doubly compromised by this second movement of narcotics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, let me just say this: Pardons are given, commutations are given. This is, I think you could look at this as maybe another species of commutation. That is, if the Congress speaks loud and clear, and the President signs this bill, then that will be a commutation of the sentence of Agents Compean and Ramos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of the commutations that have been given recently by the executive branch, I think we need to remember that people that live in small houses sometimes have a right to commutations of sentences, just like people who live in big houses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, these two Border Patrol men are now in isolation, having spent a long time in jail, Mr. Ramos having been beaten up. Their families, most of us have met their families. This is a matter of little children wanting to see their daddies come home who, in my estimation, have not broken any law anywhere as significant as that which would justify these massive sentences that they have been given, this 11 and 12 years in Federal penitentiary, respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me add my voice to support of this amendment, which I, along with a number of other colleagues have cosponsored with our great friend from Texas (Mr. Poe).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Poe the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the support. I would like to comment on the comments earlier by the gentleman from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true. I don't know if the American public knows this, but if drug dealers bring in $5,000 of drugs or less, they are not prosecuted. But this wasn't a $5,000 case. The drug dealer first brought in $1 million worth of drugs, and in the second case he snuck in $800,000 worth of drugs. The jury was never told about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing I would like to point out is that Members of Congress met with the Homeland Security inspector general about this case. They gave us information that turned out not to be true. Mr. Skinner finally testified under oath before Congress that the information they gave us about this case was false. That is disconcerting in this type of matter when we have Homeland Security telling Members of Congress things that are not true about this particular matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't have time to go on that, but I would ask for support of this case. This is the only remedy available. In my judicial experience, I do believe in our court system, and our courts eventually will work this case out. It will be reversed, but meanwhile they are in jail. The only way they can get out of jail is if we pass this amendment. I appreciate it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I was over in my office signing letters, and I heard the discussion on the floor about Ramos and Compean, and I heard what the great gentleman from West Virginia had to say. He talked about procedures and how, really, this would be better off left to the courts in some other avenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is not about procedure. It's not about some rules and regulations that we must adhere to over what is just. What is just in this case is to set Ramos and Compean free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue of what's right for the United States of America. The morale of our Border Patrol has had a truck driven through it by those who have prosecuted and persecuted Ramos and Compean. They deserve no more prosecution. They deserve no more persecution. They need to be set free and enhance the morale of our Border Patrol and enhance the security and integrity of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue about our borders. If you believe that our borders should be secure, and if you believe that those who enforce our borders should be stood up for, you need to vote "yes" for this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent the expenditures of any funds for the purpose of enforcing the judgment or imposing the sentences handed down in the case of United States v. Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As most of you know, President Bush so far has rejected appeals by many of us for a pardon for these two Border Patrol agents who are now sitting in Federal prison for shooting a professional drug smuggler who worked for the cartels, who was fleeing back across the Rio Grande. These two agents are now serving 11 and 12 years, respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have talked to many Border Patrol agents about these cases, about the circumstances they face down there. I haven't found any that don't support Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos, and certainly their association supports them fully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the meantime, of course, the great irony here is the smuggler they apprehended for attempting to smuggle some 750 pounds of drugs into our country is free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. attorney here claimed that the agents fired on an unarmed man, but how do we know that? Because the U.S. attorney asked the jury to take the smuggler's word for that and to disbelieve the two Border Patrol agents who testified they thought he had a gun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you I held numerous hearings down there on the border in Texas in the past, over 400 attacks on our Border Patrol agents. The family members of the individual here who was smuggling say he would not move drugs without a gun on him. That is what his own family says about him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, it does take a stretch of the imagination to believe that an employee of a cartel down there would not have a gun somewhere near him moving this quantity of drugs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the U.S. attorney said the agents failed to file a report for their actions, and that proved they tried to cover up the shooting. I am not sure that was true. Two of their supervisors were on the scene within minutes, and the agents made a verbal report to them, according to Ramos and Compean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Failing to file a written report is an administration violation and normally punishable by a 3-day suspension, but it is the supervisor who is supposed to file that report, as I understand it, not the agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. attorney says that Ramos and Compean were convicted by a jury in Texas after all the evidence was presented. But, the U.S. Attorney, his team, prevented crucial evidence from being admitted in the trial. For example, the jury did not learn that the smuggler committed a second smuggling operation while he was under the grant of immunity given by the U.S. attorney. That information was withheld from the jury while it was argued that the agents, that the Border Patrol agents, couldn't have  known he was a drug smuggler, even though there was this quantity of drugs in his van.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. attorney had prosecutorial discretion in choosing to do this, and he chose to throw the book at Ramos and Compean while giving the professional drug smuggler a visa that allowed him free passage across our border to smuggle again. The attorneys for Ramos and Compean have filed an appeal with the U.S. circuit court asking for a new trial. They deserve a new trial. Yet the quickest and surest way to manifest this injustice is for President Bush to grant a full pardon or, at a minimum,  a commutation of the prison sentence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These men deserve better, and today we have an opportunity to right that wrong. By voting for this amendment to free these men, Congress will not only be correcting a terrible mistake, it will begin repairing the morale and effectiveness of our Border Patrol that have been damaged by, frankly, these reckless actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to send a different message to both the courageous men and women of the Border Patrol and to the mules and to the bosses in the drug cartels. Let's send that message today by telling the cartels that our Border Patrol means business, not business as usual.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Ramos and Compean prosecution has been the greatest miscarriage of justice in my 30 years in Washington, DC, and, believe me, I have seen a lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ramos and Compean were veteran Border Patrol agents. They had unblemished records. They had both served in the military. Ramos and Compean were veterans of the Border Patrol, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Both had been in the military. In fact, Mr. Ramos, I believe, had been a 10-year veteran. He was a naval officer in the Navy Reserve for 10 years. Ramos had been nominated the year before as Border Patrol Agent of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet these two agents, their lives have been destroyed, and they have been vilified by Department of Justice officials and this administration. One day 2 years ago, they interdicted a drug dealer. After a scuffle ensued, the drug dealer ran toward the border, shots were fired, the drug dealer was shot in the buttocks. At the end of this incident that took place in just a few minutes, where a split-second decision was made to shoot their weapons, they decided that he had gotten away. They didn't  know that the drug dealer had been hit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is where they made their mistake. They decided to not go through the 8 hours of arduous drudgery of filling out all of the reports that are necessary, the paperwork that is necessary when there is a shooting incident. So they and their supervisors, I might add, helped collect the little shell casings and determined, well, the guy didn't get hit, we will just forget it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that was a violation of procedure, yes. For that they might have deserved a suspension. Instead, this administration chose to throw the book at these men and turn what should have been just a violation of procedure, perhaps just a paperwork mistake, which sometimes happens even here in this body, they turned that into a felony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have destroyed the lives of these two defenders of our country who have spent 5 and 10 years of their lives willing to take bullets for us on the border. But our administration, this administration, decided to throw the book at them and give a free pass to the drug dealer, to the man who is bringing in $1 million worth of narcotics into our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That decision is so indefensible that I believe that the administration has been trying to cover up for that mistaken decision since that moment. What we have had, for those of us who have been looking into this, is we have been completely stonewalled by this administration, by the Department of Justice, by U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton in trying to get the information about the drug dealer and the free passes, the free passes that he had to transit into our country unescorted after this incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact of the matter is that the jury was told that the drug dealer involved was a one-timer who was trying to raise money so he could buy medicine for his mother, his sick mother. That was a lie that was presented to the jury, a lie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me repeat that. It was not true, and the prosecutors understood they were given something not true. In fact, we were told by the U.S. attorney, Johnny Sutton, well, the fact that the information that the drug dealer had been picked up a second time before that trial was kept from the jury, but that the judge was the one who decided that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That too is a lie. A lawyer may believe that, but the fact is we know the prosecutors were the ones who demanded the judge. It was their motion to keep that from the jury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why do we have an administration that feels so intent on destroying the lives of these two Border Patrol agents that they vilified them, that they keep information from the jury? This whole thing stinks to high heaven and the smell seems to be emanating from the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen, these are two people, two men, two brave heroes who were defending our country every bit as much as those men and women who are overseas right now defending our country. They were willing to risk their lives for us. We should not sit aside and let them languish in prison as their families go down into abject poverty without any health care, without any source of income. Their retirement benefits are destroyed. This is  the most mean-spirited,  nasty attack on some of the defenders of our country that I have ever seen in my lifetime. We cannot let it sit. If we are patriotic Americans, it doesn't go to just posture ourselves with the defenders of this country and then let these two men languish in prison.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to search their hearts. We can do something about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, first of all, it has been a dismay to me to see how we have treated each other in this body. I don't know why, but people are looking to bring down each other because people disagree. We can understand that with philosophical differences, but how can we ever justify someone who has gone out of their way, our representatives in the Department of Justice going out of their way to bring down two defenders, turning a paperwork mistake, a procedural error, into a felony which has destroyed  these men's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we stand up for Ramos and Compean, we stand up for the people of the United States. They know that; they are watching us. They know if we really care about the little guy, and that is what this is all about. We care about the little guy because that is what America is all about.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400570" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>To the gentleman from West Virginia, let me just say I know your concern about the process here. But I think that if you reviewed this situation and the process these two Border Patrol agents went through, you would understand why some of us are standing up and saying, first of all, the 10-year minimum for the commission of a crime while carrying a firearm, it was used to apply to these agents, was never meant to apply to law enforcement agents who are required by law to carry firearms.  And I think we can kind of understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remember when we passed that and it went through, it was sort of like, criminals, if you are going to engage in criminal activity, leave your gun at home, as a way of lowering the level of violence and the potential violence of criminals carrying firearms at the time of the commission of the crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This law that we passed at the Federal level is being applied to Federal officers who are required by statute to carry a firearm. And so now what we have is that we have law enforcement agents who are sworn to serve the American people, that are being prosecuted under a statute that says we are going to nail you because you were carrying a firearm during the commission of a crime when, as a requirement of their employment, they had to carry the firearm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Doesn't anybody else find this kind of absurd, if not ridiculous?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And all I have to say is I would sincerely hope that the chairman of the committee will take a second thought about opposing this amendment, because I think in all fairness the American people are saying we have two agents who were serving their Nation as best as they could. They might have made a mistake that should have been administered through an administrative process; and those of us in local government that have worked with law enforcement know this, excessive force happens in certain  situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this is where a Federal law that we passed in Congress that says we are going to nail the criminals who use firearms in the commission of a crime and tell them don't ever carry a firearm when you are thinking of breaking a crime, that that law is being applied to our agents who are executing the requirements of Federal law. That was never the intention of this law, but it is being applied to these two agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just have to say sincerely, I would really ask the chairman to reconsider his opposition to this amendment. I think fair-minded people that know why this Federal law was passed know that it was not meant for Border Patrol agents or any Federal agents that are required to carry a firearm, to use this law against those agents. And if you can do it to Border Patrol agents, you can do it to FBI agents, you can do it to everybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me just say something about the unique situation that we are seeing down at the border. At this location, Mr. Chairman, within the month of this incident you had Border Patrol agents under fire by automatic gunfire, AK-47s firing at our agents from across the border. There was good reason to think that our agents might have been a little more active with their guns than we might have preferred. But, in all fairness, it really comes down to: Are we willing to stand up and say there has  been a mistake, that mistake needs to be addressed, needs to be reassessed, and do we now relinquish our responsibility of the budget to the executive branch where we say these agents have been wronged?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if those of you that want to talk about this, in all the years I was in local government I saw excessive force cases brought very seldom. In this one sector, this Federal attorney has brought excessive force cases against three different law enforcement officers. Every one of them that we know of, or I know of, just happened to have been cases that involved illegal aliens, drug smugglers, foreign nationals committing a crime. That is really unique. I have never heard of that kind of situation  occurring anywhere else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, it is time that we stand up and we say, you have the jurisdiction to prosecute, you have the jurisdiction not to give clemency on this issue, but we have the jurisdiction of saying you will not use the taxpayers' funds to prosecute these men.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I understand, Mr. Chairman, the President of the United States today issued a press release saying that he was not going to ask that these officers be allowed out on bail or bond even after it was requested that they do be permitted to be released on bail and bond. I find it regrettable that the President did not give some explanation for why he didn't give these officers an opportunity to be given release on bail or bond as other people who would be on trial or given that kind of  opportunity would otherwise be given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the very least, I think the President, given the nature of these officers being in law enforcement, has an obligation to ensure their security when they are in prison because they are, I understand, at greater threat to their own lives being law enforcement officers if they are incarcerated. And I would hope that the Department of Justice in its incarceration procedures does take into account the very increased threat level to these officers because of the nature of them being law enforcement  officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That being said, however, we do have to keep in mind that it is a Bush-appointed U.S. Attorney that prosecuted these Border Patrol officers and it was a jury of a U.S. citizens who rendered a verdict based upon the U.S. law and based upon the evidence of U.S. law, not the Members of Congress here standing based upon newspapers and based upon Fox news stories and everything else, but based upon the evidence in a case presented to a jury through an evidentiary hearing. And that is what we need  to abide by is a legal process. We can't abide by a political process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we were to abide by political process every time a legal case came along and were to suspend the process every time we thought one case was more popular than the other, it would just upend the idea of justice as we know it in this country, because I think all of us could come here to the floor and tell of a unique story where someone was wronged by the system of justice in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I think that it is kind of ironic that my friends are so outraged by mandatory minimums with guns, because they are so outraged by mandatory minimums with everything, and yet they are the first ones to pass these mandatory minimums and then wonder, now finding their own friends in the behind and saying, no, we can't have it touch our friends, and then all of a sudden they don't want it that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, you know what? There are lots of people in this country who have been  caught behind these mandatory minimums who have just been caught in the wrong place at the wrong time that are now serving life sentences. Kids that have been caught in ghettos just because they have been friends of friends who have been part of gangs. Now that they have been associated with gangs, they have gotten the gang-related crime tagged onto them, which has added another  10 years to their sentence, and that has been a mandatory minimum just because of some law that we have passed saying that you get another 10 years because you are related to a gang member. Now it is very interesting that all of a sudden people are so outraged by these minimums that have been tacked on to these officers carrying firearms in the commission of a crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just think that we should all pause for a moment when we think about being tough on crime. Here is a perfect example of where it comes back to bite us in the you-know-where when we think that we are trying to be tough on crime and then find out that sometimes when we are passing these mandatory minimums it doesn't always work out the way we expected it to be.</paragraph>

I think you would agree the idea was to try to encourage anybody that, if you are going to do something that was illegal, you don't carry a gun, because it would lower that level of potential.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate the gentlemen that have bought this amendment to the floor. It is something that all America has been fixated upon, because they understand the injustice that underlies the prosecution of these two Border Patrol officers. And I would like to characterize this perhaps a little bit differently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listening to the gentleman, my friend who just got done speaking, talking about the mandatory minimums being something that comes back to bite us in the you-know-where, no, this isn't the mandatory minimum issue that is before us tonight. This is the equivalent of a private bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have brought private bills through this Congress a number of times when we see issues that there is such an egregious case for specific individuals that we will generally bring that language through the Judiciary Committee, through the Immigration Subcommittee and on through Judiciary and onto the floor. It has happened a number of times in my time here in Congress. In fact, I have one here today that one of your colleagues from your side of the aisle offered to me, and I will consider it.  But this is actually in my jacket pocket. This is a private bill asking for relief for people who have violated the law but find themselves in unique circumstances and pleading upon this Congress to make an exception because they are unique circumstances, and this is a measure to our heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does our heart have to say to us when you see two Border Patrol officers who put their lives on the line on a daily basis and find themselves caught in this legalistic vice that has unfolded because, I think, of a discretionary decision by a U.S. Attorney in his prosecution?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I am concerned about is if this Congress doesn't stand up and defend these two people, Ramos and Compean, Border Patrol officers will be reluctant to pull their weapon in the line of duty and they will be in the line of fire. And I am afraid we will lose one or more Border Patrol officers in the line of duty because they will be hesitant to ever pull their weapon. That is a piece of their thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Texas, and again thank him for his work in bringing this amendment to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Iowa for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that we've discussed this issue a lot tonight, but it's important because it has to do with the most important concept that any of us have, liberty. And we have found in the investigation of this case that the U.S. Attorney's Office has done everything it can to make sure that these two people stay in jail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key to this is that the jury did decide the facts of this case, but the jury didn't get all the facts given to them under the law. There was another case where the drug dealer brought in another $800,000 worth of drugs while he's running free at American taxpayer expense, and brings in these drugs while he's waiting to testify. Anybody who served on any jury in the country would want to know about that second case. This jury was prohibited from knowing about that because of the insistence  and the relentless prosecutor who demanded that the jury not hear about all of the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is why? Why wouldn't the prosecutor want the jury to know all the truth about this case?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't know. We do know that the Mexican Government, in its righteous indignation, sent a speedy letter over to the U.S. Attorney's Office demanding prosecution of these border agents. The Mexican Government dealing in our court system, their opinion is irrelevant, I submit, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this case is a case where our Border Patrol agents are in Fabans, Texas. I don't believe there's been a person here that's been to Fabans, Texas, unless they've gone there on purpose to see the border. It's a violent, dangerous, desolate area. And based upon the rules they have to follow, they cannot fire their weapon unless they are fired upon. In other words, they've got to take a bullet before they can defend the border. And they operate under that environment because of the national security  of our border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this case, overreaching by the prosecutor; too heavy a sentence. He even said so later after the prosecution. And what this does is release these two individuals while the appeal goes on. It releases them from custody of our Federal Government. And it's the responsibility of Congress in further investigations to find out why our Western District of Texas is so relentless in prosecuting border protectors. And this is one way we can do something. We have that authority. We can cut the funds,  and we ought to cut the funds that incarcerate these two individuals. We ought to pass this amendment in a bipartisan manner.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'd say also there is a bill following this. If this doesn't do the job, I have a bill ready to introduce that grants them a new trial, a de novo review, and it removes the jurisdiction to the Northern District of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to find a solution this. We're going to stand up and defend Ramos and Compean. This sends the message. It might get the job done. I urge adoption.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400149" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, what I would like to do is have a colloquy with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) to inquire about some of the comments that have been made here tonight so I can better understand Congress's role in this particular judicial decision, court decision, conviction in Texas, just to give me a little comfort in trying to understand our role in this case and whether or not it is appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can the gentleman from Texas tell me, after the incident occurred with the border agents and the drug dealer, who brought that information to the U.S. attorney in the very beginning? Does anybody know that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>There's a disagreement over who brought that to them. We first heard that the Mexican Consulate brought it to someone working in the Federal Government. And then we also heard that another border agent brought it, so I don't know the answer to that question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400149" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>So that's not clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did the border agents supervisors, or do you have any idea who spoke, if there was, in fact, a grand jury, to determine whether or not there was enough evidence?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>There was a grand jury investigation. I do not know who testified. The border supervisors were on the scene and were aware of the entire circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one knew that the drug dealer who disappeared back into Mexico had even been shot, and so they thought that the person was shot at and he disappeared. And the next thing they know, they are being questioned about 30 to 60 days later about the incident that occurred.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400149" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Under those circumstances, with the supervisors aware of the actions of the border agents, the defendant subsequently was found out to be wounded, under those circumstances, in a Federal court, did the prosecutor take into consideration those mitigating circumstances that border agents are often, and in your case, in the area where you represent, a very dangerous situation? This was a known drug smuggler. He had smuggled in $1 million worth of drugs. He had, apparently, a violent  past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What sentencing guidelines did the prosecutor use to give these border agents 11 years and then 12 years?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>The border agents were offered, if they pled guilty to the offense, 2 years incarceration. If they did not plead guilty and went to trial, the prosecutor added the section under our law, 924(c) section that required or would allow a mandatory additional 10 years incarceration because a weapon was used. That is subject to appeal as to whether that applies to peace officers or not. That was added. Therefore they received 11 and 12 years in the penitentiary after the trial and after sentencing  because they would not plead guilty for a crime they didn't do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400149" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Has there been an appeal filed on behalf of the defendants?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Yes. There has been an appeal. Both of these cases are on appeal, and they are in custody while these cases are on appeal.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400149" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>And it is also under appeal to determine whether or not the sentencing guidelines that we passed in the House applied in this case?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>The indictment on its face is being challenged because in the indictment it alleges the deadly weapon or the brandishing of a firearm, which requires an additional 10 years. That is also contested on appeal, whether it applies to peace officers or not.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400149" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Was it the intent of this Congress that that particular statute be applied to a peace officer or a border agent in defense of the country, the border or his own life?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>In my opinion, absolutely not. It applies to other cases where a firearm is used, such as in a robbery. It doesn't apply to border agents who are required to use and possess a firearm while they are on duty. And so it is not, in my opinion, the intent of Congress. And, of course, that will be litigated on appeal as well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I introduced an amendment today that merely reinforces current Federal law and provides a penalty for jurisdictions that choose not to follow this law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would prohibit funds from being made available to States and localities that do not abide by section 642(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996. Simply put, Congress will not distribute funds to any jurisdiction that is a sanctuary city.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Amendment offered by Mrs. Capito:</narrative>
  <narrative> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> Sec. 701. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used in contravention of section 402(e)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1324a note).&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="TITLE VII--ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to help prevent aliens who lack authorization to work legally from taking Federal jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Congress responded to the problem of document verification when hiring folks by establishing three pilot programs for employment eligibility verification. Private employers in selected States could volunteer to participate in these programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under a program called the Basic Pilot Program, Social Security numbers and Alien Identification Numbers of new hires are checked against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records. This weeds out fraudulent numbers and assures that new hires are legally eligible to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A 2001 report on the Basic Pilot Program found 96 percent of employers found it to be an effective tool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, Congress extended the Basic Pilot Program for another 5 years and made it available to employers nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1996 law stipulates that each department of the Federal Government must participate in the Basic Pilot Program. Incredibly, the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, are currently not participating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment basically says, because I hear from constituents all the time who are angry about those working who do not have legal verification. What message does it send when Federal agencies do not abide by the Federal laws?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's no excuse for having any illegal aliens taking Federal jobs. We have a Basic Pilot Program to stop this from happening. We have a law on the books that requires Federal agencies, including Commerce, Justice and State, to use it for employment verification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment provides that no funds in this appropriation bill shall be spent in contravention of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.</paragraph>
