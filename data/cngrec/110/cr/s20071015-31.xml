  <narrative>TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL AIDS WALK PORTLAND -- (Senate - October 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12861">S12861</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, next Sunday, October 14, dedicated residents of the Portland area will gather for the 21st annual AIDS Walk, an event that raises much needed funding to support the work of the Cascade AIDS Project, CAP. I would like to recognize the  commitment of the more than 10,000 walkers who are expected to turn out for this year's walk. Their efforts will better enable CAP, as well as a number of its community partners, including Our  House and Esther's Pantry, to continue gaining ground in Oregon's fight against HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In over two decades, AIDS Walk Portland has generated over $2.8 million in funding for critical services provided to the 6,000 area-families who have a loved one living with HIV. I understand the challenges organizations like CAP face in securing steady funding to support their work. With State and Federal support declining in recent years, more and more is being asked of the community and the private sector. That is why I want to personally thank those participating in this year's AIDS Walk,  as well as the generous corporate sponsors who have lent their support to ensure the event is a success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While community efforts such as AIDS Walk Portland are a key component in generating support for HIV/AIDS services, I believe we can and should do more at the Federal level. While participants will be "taking a stand" next Sunday in the fight against AIDS, I want to reaffirm my pledge to do the same in Congress. It is a cause I have fought for in my 11-year tenure, and it is a cause I will continue to fight for until we are successful in eradicating this terrible disease. When Congress returns  from the Columbus Day recess, the Senate will be discussing funding levels for next year's health and human services programs. I will do my best to secure additional support for Ryan White initiatives, especially those that support the work of local cities and communities like Portland. When we combine our efforts--at the local, State and Federal levels--we are stronger and more capable of turning the tide against HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I congratulate the Cascade AIDS Project on yet another successful AIDS Walk and wish all this year's participants a safe and enjoyable time.</paragraph>
