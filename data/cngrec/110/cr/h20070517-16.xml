    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand today with the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr) celebrating America, and that's great news. There are a lot of things that challenge us as a country, but there are some great things happening. Mr. Farr and I are cochairmen of the Travel and Tourism Caucus, and we are here today to talk about National Tourism Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent the great State of Nevada, where we have about 45 million visitors a year to our communities. But more importantly, the tour and travel industry in this country represents number one, two and three in every economy across the United States of America. Seven hundred billion dollars annually is spent on tour and travel, and that's about $109 billion in tax revenues. That's $22,000 a second, $1.3 million a minute, $80 million an hour, and $1.9 billion a day is spent on tour and travel  in the United States. It is the largest employer in the country, with 7.5 million jobs. International spending is $108 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize, for all those communities, and all those folks that represent the tour and travel industry how important it is to our economy, but also how important is to the world to share in this great America.</paragraph>
