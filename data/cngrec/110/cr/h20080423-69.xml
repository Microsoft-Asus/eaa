    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the music of Tom Petty, Sheryl Crow and Jimmy Buffett represent dramatically different styles, these three famous musicians and countless others throughout the world share one unique characteristic, they all play a Martin guitar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1833, Martin Guitar Company is celebrating its 175th anniversary in 2008. Headquartered in beautiful Nazareth, Pennsylvania, I'm very proud to have this remarkable business located in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fascinating origins of Martin Guitar date back to the late 18th century, when the company's founder and namesake, Christian Frederick Martin, Sr., was born in Germany. The son of a prominent local cabinet maker, Martin traveled to Vienna, Austria at the age of 15 to apprentice with Johann Stauffer, a renowned guitar maker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After honing his craft in Austria, Martin returned to his native Germany to open his first shop, but became entangled in a bitter dispute between the local Cabinet Makers Guild and Violin Makers Guild. This clash ultimately drove Martin to emigrate to the United States in 1833, where he opened a shop in New York City's lower West Side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years after arriving in New York City, Martin moved his family and business to Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where the shop flourished and evolved from a one-man operation into a company that employed over a dozen skilled craftsmen. In 1859, a plant was constructed on Maine and North Streets in the heart of Nazareth. Having undergone numerous expansions and modifications over time, this facility is still used by the company for shipping and storage. It also houses a retail supply store for instrument  crafting and repair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its 175-year existence, Martin Guitar Company has used innovation and foresight to survive many tumultuous periods of American history. The company actually flourished during the Civil War due, in part, to the simple fact that many guitars were destroyed during fighting and needed to be replaced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later, in the 1890s, business boomed when Martin began producing mandolins that were widely popular among the growing number of Italian immigrants arriving in the United States from Europe. The company struck gold in the 1920s when the American public suddenly became captivated by the tiny ukulele. Spurred by the overwhelming sales of ukuleles, which at the time were being produced at nearly double the rate of traditional guitars, Martin was forced to expand the capacity of its Nazareth plant  and substantially increase its workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The advent of the Great Depression in 1929 imposed incredible hardships on American households. While every industry in the Nation was impacted by the economic downturn, Martin found it exceptionally difficult to sell guitars and musical supplies to a public desperately trying to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Depression, the company reluctantly abandoned aspirations for increasing sales and focused exclusively on economic survival. To avoid scaling back the already reeling workforce, Martin diversified its production and began manufacturing violin components and even wooden jewelry. Desperate for a concept to reinvigorate sales, the company explored numerous product modifications which ultimately led to two important developments, the creation of the now famous "Dreadnought" guitar, and  the invention of the 14-Fret Guitar Neck, which today is an industry standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From 1948 to 1970, the company experienced unprecedented growth due to post-war prosperity and the rise in popularity of American folk music. In 1955, a new, larger plant was built in Nazareth to help meet increasing demand,  but by the early 1960s Martin guitars were back-ordered as much as 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, the company formalized its long-standing ecological policy which embraced the responsible use of natural materials and promoted the use of sustainable yield, alternative wood varieties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adopting such a progressive policy nearly 20 years ago has helped broaden the use of sustainable materials within the guitar industry over the last two decades and illustrates Martin's admirable dedication to responsible production. Martin's amazing longevity in a constantly changing industry is a true testament to the strength of the company's management and its commitment to crafting guitars of the highest quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Martin Guitar Company has been a source of tremendous pride in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania for generations. Today, I rise to congratulate the Martin family and their many employees on 175 years of achievement. I wish them many, many more years of incredible success. We are extraordinarily proud of them.</paragraph>
