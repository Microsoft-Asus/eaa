  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to acknowledge Councilman Leland Robichaux of Houma for his dedicated service to Louisiana and the United States of America. I would like to take some time to make a few remarks on his accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Robichaux started his career in oilfield services in 1964, traveling the world with his family as a result. He helped found the South Central Industrial Association 10 years ago, serving as the business organization's president from 2003 to 2004. Also active from the beginning in membership initiatives and infrastructure issues, he earned the SCIA's Tillman Esteve Award last year for his contributions. Outside his job as a salesman for Oil States, an offshore oil-and-gas manufacturer, he  traveled annually with the Houma-Terrebonne Chamber of Commerce to Washington, DC, to lobby for hurricane protection for the past 8 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Robichaux was elected to the Terrebonne Parish Council District 6 seat last fall. He represented the parishes of southwest Terrebonne, Donner, Gibson, parts of Bayou Black and  neighborhoods between La. 311 and Bayou Black Drive. The week before he was sworn into office, Mr. Robichaux learned he had two tumors on his brain, caused by cancer that started in his lungs. Despite his illness, he continued to serve his constituents and was open about his  cancer diagnosis, and when asked about his progress, he shared information about his treatments and his determination to press on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leland Robichaux passed away Sunday, June 1. In his roughly 4 months on the council, he helped work on coastal-restoration and levee projects. He is survived by not only family members but also the grateful city of Houma and council who have lost a great man and great leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, today, I rise to honor a fellow Louisianan, Leland Robichaux, and thank him and his family for his dedicated service to our State and Nation.</paragraph>
