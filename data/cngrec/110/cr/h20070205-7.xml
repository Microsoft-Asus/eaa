  <speaking speaker="400638" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce the introduction of <bill type="h" number="610">H.R. 610</bill>, the Preserve Historic America Act. This bill would expand and facilitate the use of Federal historic preservation tax credit and create a new historic preservation tax credit for our homeowners. The economic incentives created by the bill will produce historic preservation, economic growth, and spawn jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A study of the Missouri Historic Preservation Tax Credit program, a widely respected program that expands upon the current Federal program, showed State assistance of $74 million in tax credits contributed to $267 million in Missouri income, $381 million in gross State product and 10,278 Missouri jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Missouri has led the way in creating the most utilized historic preservation tax credit in the country, and I am proud to bring my home State's successes to the Federal level. <bill type="h" number="610">H.R. 610</bill> will provide the economic incentive necessary to save our historic treasures, while simultaneously creating a far-reaching monetary benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.</paragraph>
