    <paragraph>Mr. President, every year during the month of March, we honor the women who have made a lasting impact on our country's history with Women's History Month. This month, I want to pay tribute to a true Arkansas pioneer who passed away earlier this year, Judge Elsijane Trimble Roy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Roy has been referred to as "Arkansas' Lady of Many Firsts." Only the third woman to graduate from the University of Arkansas law school in 1939, Judge Roy was the first female in the state of Arkansas to be appointed as circuit judge in 1966. In 1975, then-Governor David Pryor appointed Judge Roy to the Arkansas Supreme Court, making her the first woman to serve as an Arkansas Supreme Court Justice. Just 2 years later, newly elected President Jimmy Carter selected Judge Roy to serve  on the Federal bench, and she was given the distinct honor of becoming Arkansas' first female Federal judge, as well as the first female judge appointed to the eighth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The daughter of Federal judge Thomas C. Trimble, Judge Roy and her father also held the distinction of being the first father and daughter to serve as Federal judges. In fact, Judge Roy served in the same courtroom that her father presided over for nearly 20 years. She often mentioned that she could feel his presence, and in a 1996 interview with the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, she noted that "It's meant so much to me to be able to try cases in the same court. I look up there, and he helps me  with the hard cases."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A gifted athlete who loved sports, Judge Roy was a star player for the Lonoke High School basketball team in Lonoke, AR, and was a two-time women's singles champion at the University of Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Roy was devoted to both her family and her faith. She was a proud mother, grandmother, and later in life, a great-grandmother. Judge Roy was also an aunt to many nieces and nephews. She was a longtime member of First Baptist Church in Lonoke and taught Sunday school class when she lived in Blytheville, AR. According to her obituary, Judge Roy gave credit to the Lord for her many judicial appointments, saying, "I have always felt I have been brought to these positions by the Lord." The  center of her faith was her favorite Bible verse, Micah 6:8, which reads, "What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A truly remarkable woman, Judge Roy received many honors in her life, including the Outstanding Appellate Judge of 1976-1977 by the Arkansas Trial Lawyers Association. One honor, however, stands out above others. In 1976, Judge Roy was chosen as Arkansas Democrat's Woman of the Year, a distinction her mother also earned. She received a plaque for that honor, and in a 1979 Arkansas Democrat article, Judge Roy said, "If anything is ever written about me, I want it to contain the words on that  plaque. Throughout my career, the things written there are the things I have lived for."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The plaque reads:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a law clerk, lawyer, and trial judge, Elsijane Trimble Roy established a reputation for integrity, intelligence, and independence. As the first woman on the Arkansas Supreme Court, she has become a symbol of pride and inspiration to all women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Roy, you have been a source of pride and inspiration to all women, not only in Arkansas, but throughout our great land. You will most certainly be missed.</paragraph>
