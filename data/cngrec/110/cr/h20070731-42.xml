  <narrative>KILL CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS FOR FELONS -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H9191]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress should kill the pension for Members of Congress convicted of a felony. In January, I offered legislation, <bill type="h" number="14">H.R. 14</bill>, that killed a pension on the conviction of any one of 21 public integrity felonies. Both Speaker Pelosi and Hastert voted for this reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the bill we consider today leaves congressional pensions intact for violating 17 of these felonies, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, intimidation to secure contributions, and making fraudulent claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, we passed a limited reform bill that killed a pension for conviction of only four felonies. But shockingly, this bill has now been gutted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January we voted to kill the pension for a Member of Congress convicted of acting as a foreign agent, but this felony has now been deleted from the final package. Who deleted it? Is it okay for a Member of Congress convicted of a felony by acting as a foreign agent?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can see, the bill we will consider today falls far short of its potential for reform. A Member convicted of acting as a foreign agent should not receive a taxpayer pension.</paragraph>
