  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join many of my colleagues in submitting a resolution recognizing January 2008 as National Mentoring Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the extraordinary help and support that a good mentor can give to a child. High-quality mentoring programs can make all the difference to students in need. They can reduce negative outcomes, and help keep children on track. They can reduce drug and substance abuse and delinquency. They can enable students to stay in school instead of dropping out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By promoting such positive outcomes, mentors enable students to obtain the skills they need to succeed in school and in life. They improve academic achievement, and they also improve self-esteem and social and communications skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Mentoring Month is an opportunity to recognize and commend the many mentors across the country who are doing their part. It is also an opportunity to raise awareness about the real value of mentoring, and encourage more adults to become mentors. Experts estimate that nearly 18 million young students could benefit from being matched with a mentor, but only about 3 million of these youth are in such a relationship today. Fifteen million youth need a mentor--but they do not have one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mentoring a young person doesn't just pay off for the youth; it can be beneficial for the mentor as well. For the past 12 years, I have participated in the Everybody Wins Program at Brent Elementary School near the Capitol. Once a week during the school year, I spend an hour with an elementary school student. We read together, share stories, and learn from each other. This year, my first reading partner is finishing high school, and next year she will be starting college. She has stayed in touch,  and it has been amazing to see her grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Robert Kennedy often spoke of the ripples of hope that people send forth each time they act to help others. Mentors are a proven example of the power of each citizen to create such ripples, and we should do what we can to recognize and support them. I urge the Senate to approve this resolution.</paragraph>
