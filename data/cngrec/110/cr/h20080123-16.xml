  <narrative>COMMENDING IOWA FIREFIGHTERS AND MAQUOKETA RESIDENTS -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H393]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BRALEY of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute the people of Maquoketa, Iowa, for their extraordinary sense of civic duty during the course of a severe fire that destroyed a sizable part of the city's historic downtown early Saturday morning. I also want to recognize the efforts of firefighters from Maquoketa and 27 surrounding communities to extinguish the blaze and keep it from consuming other downtown buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fire was a blow to Maquoketa's historic downtown, completely destroying five buildings and causing severe damage to several businesses and homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the fire left behind physical and emotional scars, it also demonstrated what makes Iowa such a great place. Firefighters battled tirelessly through subzero temperatures and wind chills of 20 below zero to get the blaze under control. Meanwhile, hundreds of Maquoketa residents open their homes and businesses to provide warm shelter, hot food, and emotional support for the firefighters and residents impacted by the fire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps young Maquoketa resident Kalli Muhlhausen said it best: "They have our hearts, and we have their backs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowans dismiss such an outpouring of generosity as simply "the right thing to do," but the people of Maquoketa deserve a special thank you.</paragraph>
