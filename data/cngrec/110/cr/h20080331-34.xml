  <narrative>ECONOMIC PLIGHT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1794]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are desperately struggling to understand why our Federal Government is ignoring their economic plight. The average price of gasoline now sits at $3.28 and it is rising. Only a month ago, Americans paid $3.16. A year ago, they paid $2.67. Months away from the peak of the summer driving season, the American people can expect to see this trend get only worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, the United States began its plunge into nearly total dependence on imported petroleum. With 10 years of oil deficits continuing to plague our economy, we have spent too much time talking and not enough time acting. Our lack of energy independence translates into a true loss of liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the Bush administration assumed office, our Nation is importing a billion more barrels of petroleum a year. A billion barrels more. By 2007, the trade deficit of oil imports had risen to $293 billion, accounting for a third, over a third, of the total $815 billion U.S. trade deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This last statistic is truly sobering. But for this year of 2008, 51 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit, over half, is now the result of imported oil. Over half of our structural trade deficit flows directly from the increasing cost of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this equals dependence for America, not independence. It is an abrogation of our birthright as a Nation to allow us to continue in this position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based on 2007 numbers, the United States is adding $808 million a day to the trade deficit just from our imbalance in oil. The rising cost of oil added an estimated $50 billion to the Nation's trade deficit in 2006 and, on top of that, another $28 billion in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country imported 4.8 billion barrels of oil in total energy-related products in 2007 valued at $319 billion. Imagine if we would have been able to spend those dollars here at home what an injection that would be into this economy with the value of the dollar falling, so much related to imports, the economy tanking, the housing market in freefall and Americans feeling the true pinch of all of this. Our government here in Washington has not provided the leadership needed to end this plunge  into national subservience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The solution is clear: energy independence now. First, we have to look to our natural resources and pass a good farm bill to unleash the power of the earth and nature as a key part of the solution. And while there has been plenty of talk from our President about energy independence, the insistence on vetoing a bill, that does not live within artificial budget limits that he has declared, is an absurdity that threatens to destroy our progress. A good farm bill invests in rural America, providing  an investment in infrastructure and research, including the energy technologies of tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, we must continue to rely on the advanced research technology organized by the National Renewable Energy Lab and give this lab the resources to define and help redefine our new energy future. We need no less a commitment than we envisioned when we created NASA and space exploration. With that came security, and now we need energy security. It is that high a priority. This Congress, this President should be working to that end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And third, we must pass legislation to fund the energy bill that passed the House last year, and then again this year, and call on our brethren in the other body to take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless we commit to providing leadership to transform our economy, this discussion remains the rhetoric of the last century really leaving us with a confused and unfulfilled daydream that has repeated itself for the last three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the American people face $4 gasoline and see our wealth drained from us, we must take a new course. We are past the point of words. Real deeds are required. And we must stop our economic hemorrhaging and begin investing in our own Midwest, in our own country, not the Middle East, and pass on a free republic to our posterity worthy of the sacrifices of our founders and all those who gave their all in freedom's cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Liberty's call in this new century demands energy independence now.</paragraph>
