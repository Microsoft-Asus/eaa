    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="1402">H.R. 1402</bill>) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 320 South Lecanto Highway in Lecanto, Florida, as the "Sergeant Dennis J. Flanagan Lecanto Post Office Building".</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2001, America was forever changed. The rancid acts of terrorism that occurred on this day struck a chord within the people. For one moment in time we were not a hyphenated people. We were not Irish-American, African-American, Asian-American, Greek-American. We were simply American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was with a resounding spirit of patriotism that Dennis J. Flanagan went to his local recruitment station and took the vow to serve his country. As the President waged war against our terrorist adversaries, Sergeant Flanagan took his place as a member of the air assault infantry that invaded Iraq in 2003. He returned to Iraq in September for his second tour of duty and was killed when his vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb in Hawijah, Iraq, on January 19, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I offer my condolences to the family of Sergeant Flanagan and hope that my colleagues will vote in the affirmative to pass this measure that will allow the Lecanto, Florida, post office to bear the name of Sergeant Dennis James Flanagan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with my colleague in supporting this naming of the Sergeant Dennis J. Flanagan Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Flanagan grew up in Florida and attended high school there. He was active and enjoyed sports. He ran cross-country, played soccer, and was a cadet commander at the school's Civil Air Patrol squadron. He loved learning about American history and hoped that one day he would be a history professor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His commitment to military service began at an early age. He was an active member of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or Junior ROTC, where he achieved the rank of first lieutenant during his junior year of high school. He began classes in Central Florida Community College, but enlisted in the Army a week after September 11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Flanagan was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He fought with the air assault infantry that led the initial attack in 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wise beyond his years, he understood that victory could not be attained without action. He knew the dangers of war and believed in serving his country. After completing his first tour of duty, he re-enlisted in September of 2005 for a second tour. As an experienced soldier, he hoped he could act as a mentor for new soldiers, and he wanted to train the Iraqi Army recruits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 20, 2006, Sergeant Flanagan was on patrol in Iraq in his Humvee with three other U.S. soldiers and a driver when a roadside bomb, or an IED, was exploded near their vehicle. All soldiers were wearing protective body armor. However, only the driver survived the blast. Sergeant Flanagan was only 22 when he died.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we honor the life of Sergeant Flanagan, a soldier who strongly believed in the fight for freedom. He was an American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask all Members to join with me in supporting this naming and this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill, <bill type="h" number="1402">H.R. 1402</bill>, the Sergeant Dennis J. Flanagan Lecanto Post Office Building piece of legislation. It will rename the South Lecanto Highway Post Office in Lecanto, Florida, after Army Sergeant Flanagan, who was killed by terrorist insurgents in 2006 while on patrol in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I actually attended the services out at Arlington Cemetery. I was with the family. I also attended the service for the young man that was held in Citrus County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district office, I have a photograph that his mom gave me that was taken at the service. And it appears as if there is this rainbow over the marker. It is truly a tribute to this 2001 graduate of Lecanto High School because Sergeant Flanagan was an active member of the Junior ROTC, and he achieved the rank of lieutenant in his first year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within a week following the attacks of September 11, 2001, on our country, he enlisted in the Army and began his first tour of duty in Iraq. Sergeant Flanagan then re-enlisted for a second tour in Iraq in September of 2006. Tragically, he was killed, along with three other U.S. soldiers, when an IED hit a Humvee in which he was traveling. Only the Humvee driver survived the incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Flanagan was a soldier who firmly believed in our mission in Iraq and in advancing the cause of freedom. Even as a young boy, his parents told me that Dennis knew he wanted to be a soldier in the U.S. Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A soldier who felt he must defend and fight for freedom, Sergeant Flanagan received glowing recommendations from his superior officers and from fellow officers. One of the principal reasons that he re-enlisted was to act as a mentor to newly enlisted soldiers and to help train Iraqi Army recruits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking of his future as a soldier and a patriot, Sergeant Flanagan once mused in a poem that he was going to save for his son, and those words read: "And now, my son, I pray to thee, never ever forget me; that I died a soldier's death to keep you free with my last breath."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His mom shared those words with me, and I think it is appropriate that they be in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In times when children and families need role models to look up to, Sergeant Flanagan was a true American hero. Our community, certainly Citrus County and all of Florida, mourn his loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope that in renaming this post office we will memorialize this brave young man, Sergeant Dennis Flanagan, and never, ever forget his sacrifice for our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply want to commend the gentlewoman from Florida for introducing this resolution, which speaks directly to the greatest gift that one can give, and that is to give his or her life for the benefit of their fellow man and woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A young man, who had no concern, really, for himself, but was concerned for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have no further speakers here today on this fine young gentleman. But, in closing, I can think of no more appropriate statement on the United States Armed Forces than to have a gentleman with a classic Irish name from Florida be honored on the same day for another post office as a gentleman born in Mexico, growing up in California, whose father was a day laborer. I think that speaks volumes about the kinds of men and women who are defending our country, not questioning anything  except that their country asked for them and they have followed and, unfortunately, two have fallen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage of both of these pieces of legislation. I thank the majority for moving them in an expeditious fashion.</paragraph>
