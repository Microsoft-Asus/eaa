    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the President gets ready to ask this Congress for an additional $145 billion to fund his efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new report has come out showing tens of millions of dollars in wasteful spending by our government in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, released his quarterly report last week. It concluded that the $300 billion U.S. war and reconstruction effort is plagued with waste, spiraling violence, and corruption. Among the worst misuses are $43.8 million for a residential training camp that stands empty, about $4.2 million for 20 VIP trailers and an Olympic-sized pool that was ordered by the Iraqi ministry of interior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps the most disconcerting, however, is that our government spent $36.4 million for armored vehicles, body armor and communications equipment that could greatly benefit our troops, but it is completely unaccounted for. Mr. Speaker, this abusive spending in Iraq must stop for the American taxpayer and for the troops.</paragraph>
