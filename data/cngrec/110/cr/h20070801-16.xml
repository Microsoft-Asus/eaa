    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in 2002, when I was campaigning for Congress, I met Dolores Sweeney, who had three children. She worked full time at an insurance company, was too rich for Medicaid and too poor to get her own private insurance because her company didn't provide it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, her three children are enrolled in SCHIP. Those kids, today, have health care because we did right, where, between private sector not providing health care and Medicaid, a woman who worked full time did right by her children, got healthcare for her kids, and her 19-year-old today is going to college and doing the right choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question we have before us, as my colleague from South Carolina just asked, are we going to provide our constituents with the healthcare that our own children and Members of Congress get, that taxpayers pay for? That is the question that is going to be before us today: Are we going to do right by the Dolores Sweeneys of the world in the same way that our constituents do right by us, as Members of Congress, and for our own children? These are people who have worked full time, at no fault of  their own, whose children don't have health care. And we will provide those children, 11 million children, the health care that their parents cannot provide.</paragraph>
