    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Florida Gators for their win Monday night to capture their second football national championship. With the Gators' 41-14 defeat of the Ohio State Buckeyes, they become the first Division I school to hold the national championship in men's basketball and football at the same time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coming into this game, many of the so-called experts did not give the Gators any chance of defeating the previously undefeated Buckeyes. However, once they took the field, the Gators were not intimidated. In fact, the Gators held Ohio State to only 82 yards of total offense, the fewest number of yards in BCS history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Florida Gators are an excellent example of both the university and the great State of Florida in their tenacity, spirit and, of course, their desire to succeed. I take great pride in representing the University of Florida and congratulate Coach Urban Meyer and the entire university on this great accomplishment.</paragraph>

  <chair> I wanted to ask my colleague to continue for another minute since I am from Florida.</chair>
