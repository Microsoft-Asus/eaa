    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the time until 2:45 is equally divided, with the majority controlling the first portion of the time. Senator Casey is here and will be using that time to do a tribute. At 2:45 today, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, the competitiveness bill. While there are no rollcall votes today, I understand the managers are working on some amendments which could be offered today. Later this week, we expect to receive the supplemental conference report,  and the Senate will act on that report prior to concluding business this week.</paragraph>
