    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, which was reported by the Committee on Education and Labor pursuant to the reconciliation instructions of the budget resolution. The committee was tasked to decrease the deficit by $750 million without reducing the assistance that makes college more affordable to students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In keeping with that policy, this bill will significantly reduce the costs that place college out of reach for far too many students today. This bill represents the largest effort to help students and families pay for college since 1944, when the Congress passed the GI Bill, which helped millions of veterans go to college, the first generation to do so under that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, college costs are rising rapidly and are far outstripping families' ability to pay for them. Students are graduating with more debt than ever before and are working harder to pay back the loans which they borrowed to pay for their college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several hundred thousand students a year now decide to forego a college education, even though they are completely qualified, fully prepared to go to college, because they don't know how they'll pay for it or how they'll manage the debt that they will inherit when they graduate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing this need, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> demonstrates our commitment to growing and strengthening America's middle class by making college more affordable and accessible for all qualified students. It also recognizes our commitment to those who are less fortunate, for low-income families, to make sure that we increase the Pell Grants that are available to the students, and also low-cost loans to those same students who need to borrow beyond the Pell Grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act, which passed the Committee on Education and Labor with bipartisan support, boosts the college financial aid by roughly $18 billion over the next 5 years. And this bill does so in a fiscally responsible way. We are committed to the pay-as-you-go budget rules, and we honor that commitment with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> recognizes that we have an obligation to make sure that students have the maximum opportunity to take advantage of a college education and that they need access to that education, they need preparation for that education, they need success while they're there, and they need completion of their education. To do that we've made sure that, regardless of their background, that they will be prepared for college, they will have access to higher education, they will graduate to achieve their  goals, and they will not be so burdened with unmanageable debt that that becomes a failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill does that by, for low-income students, increasing the Pell Grant $500 over the next 4 years. This is a very significant increase in the Pell Grant. As many know, the President promised many years ago that he would have it up to $5,100, and the fact of the matter is it was at $4,050. They failed to increase the Pell Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It cuts in half the interest rates for subsidized loans for hardworking families that are going to borrow money, students that are borrowing money. We will cut their interest rates in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. This will save the average student graduating with about $13,000 in debt, $4,400 over the life of that loan. We guarantee that those students who borrow this money, when they begin their time in the work world, they will not have to commit more, if they decide not to, to commit  more than 15 percent of their income to pay back the loans so that they can enter those professions that may not have great starting wages, but over time in that career, they will build up income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also provide, in keeping with the mandate, to try to provide highly qualified teachers in every classroom for students who are excelling in college and want to teach, if they make a commitment to teach in difficult public schools, we will provide $4,000 a year in tuition assistance while they're in school, not after they graduate, while they're in school, to a maximum of $16,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those students who go to college and they get their degrees and they want to enter professions and serve the public, they want to be first responders, they want to be nurses, they want to be firefighters and public defenders and prosecutors and special education teachers and early childhood teachers, we offer them a $5,000 forgiveness of their loans if they stay in that field for 5 years. We know that in each one of these areas there is a crisis in attracting people to those fields. Many  in Congress, hundreds of Members of Congress, have co-authored legislation to provide loan forgiveness for some of these professions. This bill, in fact, funds that loan forgiveness for those individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also increase the loan limits so that students will have greater access to more money to pay for the increasing cost of college and not have to go to the private market, where they will be able to continue to take advantage of the subsidies provided in the Federal loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 additional minutes.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>We also make a landmark investment in minority-serving institutions to make sure that those institutions that serve a disproportionate number of minority students are able to provide the services, to make sure that those students who are fully qualified to go to college, who are prepared to go to college, in fact, stay in college, so we don't have a continuation of the situation we had today where, all too often, because services aren't provided in college to  help those students stay in college, those students end up out of college, no diploma and a lot of debt. And we want to make sure that that, in fact, doesn't happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today this legislation provides a great deal of promise and a great deal of assistance and a great deal of resources to those students and their families who are sitting down figuring out how they're going to pay for this college education that is so incredibly valuable today if you're going to fully participate in the American economic system, if you're going to participate in our democratic society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very, very important piece of legislation. This is legislation that is designed to help these students be able to pay for that education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do something else in this legislation. We set up a partnership where we go to the private sector, to wealthy individuals, to corporations, to foundations, and we tell them for every dollar that they'll put up to pay for essentially a Pell-eligible student to complete their education without going into debt, we will match them 50 cent on the dollar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told by those individuals who have actively been participating in raising money for these students that this should allow them to raise hundreds of millions of dollars additionally because of that match; to have that public/private partnership pursuing one of the great goals of this great democratic society, which is to make sure that a student from any part of American society who's prepared to go to college can, in fact, go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we not only have the government helping them out, we also have private citizens, corporations, philanthropic organizations, and in some cases even local governments if they decide this is good for their economy, and we will provide a match to help them do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a comprehensive bill. It recognizes the complex needs of families and students to gain access to college, to pay for college, and to succeed in their employment afterwards; and I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the cleverly titled College Cost Reduction Act. And what I would like to encourage my colleagues to do, in listening to this debate, is try to find what in this bill actually will cut or lower the cost of a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There will be a lot of talk about cutting subsidies to lenders. There will be a lot of talk about lowering student interest rates, which actually then is paid to graduates of college, but what are we doing to hold down the cost of a college education? The cost of higher education has been going up more than four times the rate of inflation for the last 20 years, and we have not done anything to lower those costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill allegedly has been crafted to balance fiscal responsibility with significant new aid for college students and their families. In fact, the majority touts the bill as the most substantial package of new benefits since the GI bill. But under the microscope, it is clear that these claims fall completely flat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In reality, this legislation is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for new entitlement spending at the long-term expense for American taxpayers. Even though we are considering this bill under the expedited procedure of budget reconciliation, which, as my colleagues know, is intended for real deficit reduction, this bill simply and shamelessly exploits the process. It cuts roughly $18.58 billion over 5 years in payments to student loan providers but simultaneously spends more than $17 billion during  that same period on multiple programs, including nine new entitlement programs. So while they are talking about cutting mandatory spending, they are actually creating nine new entitlement programs, an apparent net savings of less than 9 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These new entitlements include grants to Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian and other minority-serving institutions, grants to institutions with low tuition, grants to institutions to create new teacher preparation programs, grants to philanthropic organizations, a new mandatory Perkins loan program, cooperative education grants, and on and on and on. These sound like wonderful things, and I think what we are really seeing is that Democrats are Democrats. Give them an opportunity to spend money,  they can't help themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History has proven that once Washington, DC creates a new entitlement program, it never ever dies. In other words, taxpayers will foot the bill for this onslaught of new entitlement spending for years to come. These same students that will be given some savings through some of these special entitlement programs eventually are going to have to pay for them in higher taxes that they will provide later. During that time, it will certainly dwarf the token "savings" found in <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be noted, too that much of this new entitlement spending is aimed at colleges, universities and philanthropic organizations, which we have never done before. The Federal Government has been sending Federal money to the students directly. Now they are sending it to organizations rather than to the students. This represents a historic departure from the intent of Federal student aid programs. As long as the Higher Education Act has existed, student aid entitlement dollars have been targeted  towards students themselves. It is lost on me how sending these funds to institutions rather than to the students attending them helps more Americans pay for college. I doubt that we will see any reduction in tuition rates when they get this new money. But that is just what <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> aims to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is more, Mr. Speaker, other proposals included in this bill, such as the interest rate cut for certain college graduates included in the ill-fated Six for '06 legislation passed earlier this year, will have even more explosive long-term costs that could amount to tens of billions more in Federal Government spending. Who will be paying for it? You guessed it. The American taxpayers. And don't forget the cut to interest rates would not aid a single college student. Only graduates. Rather,  the benefit would be aimed squarely at those who by definition no longer attend college. While the intent of this new spending is admirable, it is equally misdirected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush has threatened a veto of this disingenuous legislation and for good reason. With billions in new programs, most of which are directed toward institutions and graduates rather than students, those who really need the help to get into college and stay in college to get on the ladder to achieve the American Dream, this bill marks the first step towards an explosion in new, unchecked entitlement spending and another unfortunate step toward further hyperinflation in college  costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, the measure before us overreaches by creating new entitlement spending for every conceivable constituency in higher education. It overreaches by failing to focus on the historical Federal roll in higher education supported by Democrats and Republicans alike: helping low-income students. And it overreaches by extracting too much out of the Federal Financial Aid Program, which has been a success by all measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot support it, and I ask my colleagues to join me in opposition.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, and I thank Chairman Miller for his impressive work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of this legislation, Iowa students and families will receive $232 million over 5 years in additional benefits in the form of student loans and Pell grants. Almost 77,000 students will benefit from the eligibility expansion and Pell Grant increase in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very pleased that an amendment that I offered in committee to allow part-time students and students in certificate programs to participate in the year-round Pell Grant program and accelerate their studies was accepted.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the student aid bill that passed out of the Committee on Education and Labor is nothing but a Trojan Horse for new spending. In fact, the bill creates nine, count it, nine new entitlement programs and abuses the protection of reconciliation procedures through token budgetary "savings." It also favors the government-controlled and costly direct lending program over the nonprofit and commercial lenders, promoting a back-door expansion of taxpayer-financed student support and a substantial  increase in taxpayer liability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make four basic points, Mr. Speaker: Number one, budget experts have unequivocally warned Congress, experts from the left and from the right and center and everywhere else, that the unrestrained growth in entitlement spending programs is the most  fundamental challenge and the largest threat to our Nation's long-term economic health. Comptroller General David Walker refers to the rising costs of entitlements as a "fiscal cancer" that threatens</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, this creates a new mandatory Pell Grant program. Among the new entitlement programs created is an unprecedented mandatory Pell Grant. The Pell grant is a great program, and under Republican leadership, we saw a tripling of Pell Grants from the year 1996 to 2006. Suddenly, this authorizing committee doesn't think that it is enough, and it is planning on taking the committee away from the appropriators into their jurisdiction, making an entitlement which, in my opinion, reduces congressional  oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this contains no meaningful reform whatsoever. The bill contains none at all. It represents business as usual for existing programs, except that interest rates and limits in existing programs are changed to make room for more spending. Rather than maybe putting the savings in special education or deficit reduction to fund an unfunded mandate in local schools or reducing our deficit, it creates all of these new programs and this new spending. They will add from $15 billion to $32 billion  in spending over the next 5 years alone on top of the already unsustainable entitlement costs we are facing today. Instead of reducing long-term spending, they are using a vehicle originally intended to limit spending to do just the opposite, to fund these new programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill gets Fast-Track legislation under the guise of deficit reduction, under the guise of controlling spending. Yet what we see here today is a bill that takes $18.58 billion from student loan providers only to spend more than $17.13 billion on new entitlement programs. The savings of this bill is 9 percent, a net savings of 9 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at these two bars on the chart next to me. Does it look like the savings are anywhere near the new spending level, or does it look like a sliver of savings is being used to abuse the process of expedited reconciliation protection so they can create all of these new programs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would have required that the bulk of these savings be going toward deficit reduction. It is the same amendment that Senator Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, offered and was passed by unanimous consent on the Senate floor. I couldn't even get this amendment past the Rules Committee, much less on the floor of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one last point, Mr. Speaker, that bears repeating, and that is, this favors government over markets. It increases taxpayer liabilities. It favors a government-controlled and costly direct lending program over nonprofit and commercial lenders, promoting a back-door expansion of taxpayer-financed student support. As students are pushed toward the government monopoly, the student benefits and services provided by nongovernment lenders to attract business would be lost. Further, the government-run  program only handles 20 percent of the loans today. It would be overwhelmed with the new business and shut done, as it has been in the past, when large volumes shifted to the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to finish with one quote from the Democrat chairman of the Budget Committee: "The reconciliation instruction that led to this bill" we are seeing here today is a "stalking horse for a significant expansion of spending."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please join me in opposing this back-door expansion of new entitlement spending. Let's use budget reconciliation for what it was made for, reducing the deficit and controlling spending, rather than creating nine new entitlements.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the College Reduction Act of 2007, and I thank the chairman and the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. I think it is a great step forward for our college students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important piece of legislation will strengthen the middle class by making college more affordable in several ways at no additional cost to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it will increase the maximum Pell grant scholarship by at least $500 over the next 5 years, and expand student eligibility for other grants like the National SMART grant. Both of these things will increase the purchasing power for students who otherwise would not be able to afford going to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Texas alone, over 475,000 students will benefit from a $500 increase in the Pell grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this bill will cut interest rates on need-based Federal student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of this will be done at no additional cost to the taxpayers by cutting excess subsidies paid by the Federal Government to lenders in the student loan industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four of the six offsets were already approved by the House this year, when it overwhelmingly voted to pass the College Student Relief Act of 2007 this past January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the past few years, student lenders have been able to increase their efficiencies through market-driven mechanisms, but the Government's subsidization has continued unchecked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congress has a chance to help the American people at no additional cost for the taxpayer. How can we resist doing this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our district, financial barriers often inhibit the ability of high school graduates to go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By reducing student loan interest rates and increasing Federal grants, we are encouraging families and students to get a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we pass this legislation, we are investing in the future of our economy, because we will have more college graduates with a lower debt burden. This will enable graduates to do things like buy homes, invest, and fuel our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is such a critical bill, and it's important that this body approach this bill in a manner that shows bipartisan support for educating our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, which would provide the most significant investment in higher education since the GI bill. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I thank Chairman Miller for his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do here in Congress does matter. It does matter to ordinary people and to the average American. I was struck by an article in USA Today earlier this year about a family whose daughter was pursuing an undergraduate degree in art. Despite the fact that their daughter received scholarships to cover about a fifth of her cost, this family had to clean out their emergency savings account and their college savings fund and then borrow from the family's 401(K) plan. Still their daughter will  graduate with $45,000 in loans. That's just not right. It doesn't have to be that hard. And it won't be that hard if we pass the College Cost Reduction Act, which cuts interest rates for student loans, provides fiscally responsible and targeted loan forgiveness, and increases and expands the Pell Grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was thrilled to be able to work with Chairman Miller and others on the committee to ensure provisions that would advance loan forgiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a terrific bill, and I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this might possibly be the single most fiscally irresponsible bill to come to the floor this year, and it has had a lot of healthy competition. Why? Because this bill would create nine, count them, nine, Mr. Speaker, new entitlement programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, we all know what entitlement programs are; sometimes the American people don't. These are the programs that we put on automatic pilot that get very little oversight. And these nine new entitlement programs are going to be on top of almost 10,000 other Federal programs that are already on the books. And we know that it is entitlement spending that is threatening future generations and threatening their educational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the ranking member on the Budget Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin talked about, we've heard from our chairman of the Federal Reserve, "Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the costs, costs that could have been used for their educational opportunities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've heard from Comptroller General Walker, "The rising costs of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America." And what does this bill do, Mr. Speaker? It ignores this greatest fiscal threat to our Nation, a threat to educational opportunities, and dumps nine new entitlement spending programs on top of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I have no doubt that the bill's sponsor will claim that this saves money, but it uses gimmicks. It claims that these entitlements will expire. Well, Mr. Speaker, we see Haley's Comet more frequently than we ever see an entitlement program expiring in the Nation's Capitol. It's got interest rate snapbacks. And we all know that once these entitlement seeds grow, the cost will be borne by future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing I want to make very clear, Mr. Speaker, is that the worst part of this program is that it will ultimately lessen educational opportunities for hardworking American families. And it will because it is all part of a Democratic spend-and-tax program. Programs like these necessitate the largest single tax increase in American history, which they put into their budget, which takes away from families' opportunities to spend on their educational opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard from Melanie in Chandler, Texas, who's in my district. She wrote, "Congressman, if I have to pay more taxes, then I can't afford to go to school. If taxes are raised, I won't have a choice but to quit school and go back to work."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard from Rose in Garland, Texas, also in my congressional district. "I'm a divorced mother with a child in college and a child in daycare. An increase in taxes would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard from Bruce in Garland. "In my particular case, an additional $2,200 in taxes would cut into the finances I use to pay for my son's college education. I really believe that given more money, Congress will spend more money, so that is not the answer. A control in reduction of spending is what is needed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, there are very few opportunities that are as wondrous and as fundamental to the American Dream as education. And so I want to make it very clear again today, we're not having a debate over how much we're going to spend as a Nation on education, but we are having a very fundamental debate on who does that spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, brought by the Democrat majority, would put all of the control in government. It would reduce opportunities. It would reduce choice. It would reduce innovation for families trying to finance education. And ironically, as part of the largest single tax increase in American history, it takes money away from families. But if people beg for it, maybe they'll get a little bit of it back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should reject this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself 15 seconds to say, it's most interesting to sit here and be lectured by people who, when they controlled every department of government, every branch of government, they took a $5 trillion surplus that they inherited from the Clinton administration and immediately turned it into a $3 trillion debt that this Nation now is carrying around as it tries to compete in the world. To be lectured by mindless spenders like that is really a treat on this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400031" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have many good things to say about this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, but let me focus on a couple of quick things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it is a long overdue and much-needed infusion of support for Federal need-based financial aid programs. It raises the Pell Grant maximum from $4,310 to $5,200 over a period of years. It increases the Federal capital contribution for the Perkins loan program, a program, by the way, that this administration seems intent on killing, and it increases loan limits so that students will have access to greater support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In doing all of those things, we help students avoid what has become termed the "wild west" of student lending, that is, the private loan market. We have driven students to the private loan market because we have not properly supported the programs that currently exist. And with these increases, we will be properly supporting those programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, the reduction in the interest rates has been characterized by the other side as not affecting access or affordability and, in fact, it does. Students make decisions about the schools that they are going to attend by virtue of their anticipated indebtedness, and we address that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want to congratulate the chairman. There is nobody in this body who has served longer with more focus on the quality of education, the access to higher education, and whether we're dealing with primary, secondary or higher education, more concern than George Miller of California, and I congratulate him on the service that he has given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate the ranking member, who himself has been an outspoken advocate of education quality in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say, before I start my remarks, that I'm always interested to hear the comments of the ranking member of the Budget Committee and of the leader of the Republican Study Committee. I'm interested to hear their remarks because of course they have both said nine new entitlements. I was here with both of them for 3 hours one night, from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. in the morning, and we enacted the largest entitlement that has been enacted since the 1960s, and we were told that was going to cost $395  billion by the administration. The administration did not tell us the truth, and they knew they were not telling us the truth. And the person who knew the truth was prohibited by the administration from giving us the truth on pain of being removed, a civil servant, not an administration appointee. He knew the cost of that program, as he projected it, was $524 billion, or $125 billion more than we were told on this floor. But it was told $395 billion additional entitlement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the interesting thing is that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hensarling both voted for that program. That program has a larger unfunded liability as of this day than Social Security. So I think the lecture on fiscal responsibility is, frankly, not well taken.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would be glad to yield to my friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Did the gentleman support the Democrat alternative that cost even more, as scored by CBO?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>The gentleman, of course, is not on this floor lamenting  the creation of entitlements as is my friend from Texas, so I suggest your question is inappropriate because your concern is about entitlements. But you voted for an entitlement that was the largest entitlement passed on the floor of this House in four decades, about as long as I think the gentleman has been alive. I wish that I could say the same; unfortunately, I've been alive a lot  longer than that. So I think the question begs the question, my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me say about this landmark legislation, the College Cost Reduction of 2007 is yet another example of how this Democratic Congress is committed to moving our Nation in a new and better direction and working on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, this legislation will provide the single largest investment in college financial aid, and about $18 billion over the next 5 years. Now, that is about one-fifteenth of the mistake that was made in the entitlement that you supported, my friend. And it's the largest since the GI Bill was funded in 1944. The GI Bill was an entitlement. And very frankly, the Greatest Generation was worth investing in. And that investment has paid off 100 fold in the economy that this Greatest Generation  built in America, and it will do so in this case as well. And it does so at no new cost to the American taxpayer by cutting excess subsidies paid by the Federal Government to lenders in the student loans industry. The administration suggested $16 billion. We're a little above that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few months ago Bill Gates, the chairman and cofounder of the Microsoft Corporation and one of our Nation's great innovators, wrote in the Washington Post, "If we, the United States, are to remain competitive, we need a workforce that consists of the world's brightest minds." That's what this bill seeks to enhance. Mr. Gates added, "Education has always been the gateway to a better life in this country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation not only recognizes that education is a key to personal development, fulfillment and success, but also, and critically, a crucial factor in our national competitiveness, our continued prosperity, and yes, I suggest to all of my colleagues, our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply stated, this legislation will make a college education more affordable for millions of students and their families. The fact is, college tuition today is exploding. Tuition at 4-year public colleges has grown by 35 percent in the last 5 years. Let me say in my State of Maryland, tuition cost has gone up 43 percent in the last 4 years. America cannot afford to shut people out of the access to college education if we're going to be successful in world markets in a flat world, as Tom Friedman  refers to it. Too many students graduate with tremendous debt, and too many others simply don't go to college because they cannot afford it. To address this situation, this bill will increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarships by at least $500 over the next 5 years. That will not come close to what the Pell Grants initially, when they were adopted, replaced in tuition</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also will cut interest in half on subsidized student loans over the next 5 years, and it will guarantee that borrowers will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their discretionary income to loan repayments. In addition, this bill seeks to ensure highly qualified teachers in every classroom, a critical need in our Nation, by providing up-front tuition assistance to qualified students who commit to teaching in public schools in high-poverty communities or high-need areas. That is important  for our country's ability to compete and to develop every mind in America. There is not a child to waste in America. We know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It encourages and rewards public service by providing loan forgiveness for first responders, law enforcement officers, firefighters, nurses and others. And it encourages landmark new investment, $500 million guaranteed over 5 years, for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribally controlled, native or predominantly black institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a very significant and important step toward realizing the goal of making college affordable for every qualified student.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate Chairman Miller once more and the staff and all of the members of the committee and Mr. McKeon for the positive role, whatever position one might take for or against, the positive role that the committee has played. It is a historic investment in our people and our Nation. I urge every Member to strongly support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't know how I am always so lucky, or unlucky, I guess, to speak after the majority leader's minute, which is probably the longest minute I have ever seen. But to listen to him talk, you know, this weekend I bought a TV from somebody that was as good a salesman as Mr. Hoyer. I didn't need the TV. It was too expensive, and I really didn't want it. But after talking to the salesman, I ended up thinking I needed it and I could afford it and it was what I needed. So I bought  it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hoyer and I have had this conversation on the floor before, and that is that you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. So the American people were sold a bill of goods last November, and they are continually being sold things in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from Georgia. We have the HOPE scholarship, Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest tools for education that I think has been done. It comes from a lottery, which a lot of people oppose, but a lot of young people in Georgia are now able to go to college. What we found in Georgia was that when the State started paying for the college tuition, that the tuition went out of sight. It was another funding means for these institutions of higher education to charge more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the majority leader said that tuition in Maryland had gone up 43 percent in 4 years. Well, if he thinks that is something, wait until this bill passes. Because what is going to end up happening is that when the government starts loaning the money and paying for this, those tuitions are going to skyrocket, because the people that are getting it don't really care how much the tuition is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this: When I bought this TV that I didn't need, that I couldn't afford, I got down to the bottom dollar of what I thought that I could afford. Of course, this great salesman walked away because he said, do you know what? If I can't make some money, I am not going to do this. We ended up negotiating. What ended up happening is that I paid up more than what I wanted to. He took less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But a bank is not going to loan money if they can't make money. We hear a lot of back and forth on this floor. We don't know who to believe and who not to believe. Let me tell you the truth. If a bank, a lending institution, cannot make money, they are not going to do business with people. So the reality is that the private sector is going to get out of making these loans, which is probably the last stop we have of having any type of accountability to it. The government is going to start doing  it all. If the banks will not loan it at this interest rate because they are losing money, and the government will, then that means, again, here is the thing, if we continue to govern our political correctness, the taxpayers end up holding the bag. They are going to end up holding the bag on this.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your great leadership in bringing us to this historic day. I thank all of the other members of the committee for their leadership in making this day possible, for expanding America's middle class, for giving opportunity to America's children, and for making our future brighter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1944, when the GI Bill of Rights became law, our Nation made a decision. They made a decision to invest in the future. It was an investment that transformed the lives of millions of Americans. It transformed America to the benefit of all Americans. Indeed, it built America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, the GI Bill offered opportunity and economic security through education to more than 20 million of the brave men and women who wore our Nation's uniform. It has given America hundreds of thousands of engineers, teachers and doctors, and it has given us a model for the value of investing in the education of our people for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with this legislation, we will make the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill of Rights revolutionized America. It is an investment for a bright future for our children, and, just as the GI Bill has been, an investment in a bright future for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any economist will tell you that any dollar spent on education is a dollar that makes a big return to our Treasury. In fact, no dollar invested or spent, no tax credit, no financial initiative you can name brings more money to the Treasury than investing in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank Chairman Miller and the distinguished members of the Education and Labor Committee for their leadership in making sure higher education is affordable and accessible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's competitive job market, a college education often makes all the difference. Americans with college degrees can earn 60 percent more than those with only a high school diploma. So in the interests of individuals, this is very, very important. Indeed, higher education is the single best investment our young people can make in themselves, that families can make in the success of their children, and our country can make in its future strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note why this legislation is very important. Financial barriers will prevent 4 1/2  million high school graduates from attending a 4-year public college over the next decade and prevent another 2 million high school graduates from attending any college at all. Over 6 1/2  million students will not have access to some college or any college at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Higher education, as we all know, is the key to achieving the American dream. This legislation has made sure that all who are qualified and determined to have that education will have access to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been said that cutting interest rates in half will make it possible for more Americans to achieve their potential. This is especially important for strengthening the middle class. Middle-income families in America struggle to educate their children. This interest rate cut is very important for them. By increasing the maximum Pell Grant scholarship by over $500, nearly 6 million students will be given help to afford expanding college costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In hearing the debate on the cost, I think that it is important to note that the cost of this bill is the equivalent of 6 weeks in Iraq; 6 weeks in Iraq. Imagine that, for 6 weeks in Iraq, we can expand higher education to all who wish to achieve it in America. That investment has a return to our Treasury. It will grow our economy and prepare us for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a very important part of our Innovation Agenda, where we do need to invest in many more scientists, engineers and mathematicians. By giving opportunities to highly qualified teachers in our classrooms for this Innovation Agenda, it provides an essential component for a bright future for our Nation. It will provide up-front tuition for highly qualified teachers who agree to teach in high-needs areas, increase loan forgiveness for those who practice civic responsibility and  encourage students to give back to their communities as teachers, librarians, childcare and welfare workers and public sector employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members have talked about this over and over again. The fact is that, again, for the cost of 6 weeks in Iraq, we can ensure the education of our young people across the broad spectrum of America. We can reward those who want to be civically involved as teachers. It is all paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are not only relieving the debt of America's students, but doing so in a way that not only helps relieve their debt but does not heap mountains of national debt on top of our young people. This legislation keeps our promise to pay as you go with no new deficit spending. Democrats believe that is just as essential as ensuring that American students have the opportunity to attend college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the College Cost Reduction Act strengthens the future for our students and it strengthens our Nation. I think, again, that this is a historic day, because it is a day that is about the American dream. It is a day about expanding opportunity in our country. It is a day that recognizes that the best dollar that we can spend is a dollar spent on education. It recognizes that education is the key to a brilliant future, not only for the self-fulfillment of our people, but for the success  of our country. It is about our self-fulfillment personally. It is about growing our economy. It is about our National security. It is about carrying the banner of our Founders who have made a commitment to future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairman Miller, and members of the Committee on Education and Labor, for helping us honor that commitment to future generations. I urge our colleagues to support this very important and historic legislation.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong opposition to this cleverly entitled College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Under the guise of saving money and paying down the deficit, Democratic leaders are using the budget reconciliation process as a vehicle to create a host of expensive new Federal bureaucracies rather than making tough decisions to restrain entitlement spending and balance the Federal budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mandatory spending programs consume the largest portion of the Federal budget, and their share will only increase as Social Security and Medicare costs explode in coming years. Unfortunately, this action comes as no surprise. After reclaiming the majority under the claims of fiscal accountability, House Democrats have already voted to approve a massive $400 billion tax increase on working families and small businesses, and may I add, that amounts to over $3,000 on average tax increase for these  students who we are attempting to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we are considering a piece of legislation that will create nine new entitlement programs resulting in $18 billion in new spending. The explosion in new, unchecked entitlement spending is another unfortunate step backwards for the American taxpayer. I agree that Congress must remain committed to ensuring affordable access to post-secondary education. But instead of focusing the bulk of need on increasing access to higher education for low-income students, the bill increases aid to colleges  and universities at the expense of students who receive Pell Grants. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> only targets $4.9 billion towards Pell Grants, increasing the maximum award by only $100 per year for 5 years. Pell Grants have proven to be effective in helping low-income students attain higher education. This bill will not prioritize Pell Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do wish to take a moment to thank Chairman Miller for working with me to remove section 201 of his bill in his manager's amendment. I was happy to work with our State's Governor to make this change. This action withheld funds from the Leveraging Education Assistance Partnership, known as the LEAP, if a State reduced the average amount of funding it has provided over the last 5 years. This so-called maintenance of effort provision is a bold and unprecedented overreach of Federal authority  designed to dictate State budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is particularly true because the Federal Government provides little direct assistance to States or higher education institutions. Low-income and financially needy students should not have to struggle because of a State's budgetary shortfalls. My home State of Michigan continues to suffer from a struggling economy and difficult choices must be made on how to most appropriately fund the State. However, needy students should not have critical financial aid yanked away because the State cannot  afford the same financial commitment it has made to the LEAP program in more prosperous years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also prepared to offer an amendment to the House Rules Committee concerning the Upward Bound program. I appreciate that the chairman's manager's amendment removes a section that earmarked $30 million for prior Upward Bound grantees who submitted low-scoring applications, bypassing 107 new applicants who submitted competitive proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But despite these small improvements, the College Cost Reduction Act contains dozens of poison pills that mark another step towards unchecked spending. I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the so-called College Cost Reduction Act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today parents have a choice of a second job, a second mortgage, or dipping into their savings to help pay for their kids' college education, and that is the wrong choice to ask parents to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Illinois, tuition last year went up, increases of 14.5 percent, the fourth largest increase of any State in America. Today when a kid graduates from college, they graduate with an average of $15,000 of debt. So on the front page they get a diploma, and on the back side, they get their first credit card bill. That is the wrong choice for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You could not write the American decade if you didn't look at the GI bill and making a high school education universal in America. Those are the two most significant economic acts of the last 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues on the other side of the aisle noted two examples. One, they are worried about the deficit. After $4 trillion of new debt, I appreciate your conversion to concern about increasing the deficit, but there is no deficit spending here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, and most importantly, they talk about the importance of the Pell Grants. This is after, in fact, the President's budget cut Pell Grants one year $1 billion, and froze it for the last 3 years. We are doing the right investment. Not one of us would be in this institution if it wasn't for two things: the love of our parents and the access to a higher education. We are providing Americans something different from the last 6 years. Rather than slamming the door shut on their access to a college  education, we are opening the doors and making the American Dream possible. I compliment our leadership for bringing this bill and opening the doors of America's future with a good college education bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I was elected to the House of Representatives last November, I asked to serve on the Higher Education Subcommittee specifically so I could help make college more affordable for American families, and this bill does just that. It raises Pell Grant awards to their highest level in history. It cuts in half the interest rates students will pay on their student loans, and this bill rewards community service by providing loan forgiveness for those who choose careers in  important fields like first responders, law enforcement, firefighters, and nurses.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for giving me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have sat here and listened to this debate on this bill, and I want to say we are back at dealing with hypocrisy again, as we have been on a daily basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act, the title is not just a misnomer; it is an outright lie. Much of the $18 billion in new spending doesn't reduce the cost of college, but instead consists of new welfare targeted at people who aren't even students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And comparing this bill to the GI bill is truly, truly hypocrisy. We instituted the GI bill to help men and women who had fought for this country and returned to this country to help them get college education and get back into our culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this is going to do is increase the nanny state. What we are doing is taking away personal responsibility from people and giving them out and out payments for loans that they take out that they don't need to take out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Economists are not going to tell us that money spent on education is a good investment, and the government doesn't invest money. The government spends money. It is interesting to me that they brought out the big guns for this bill and they say it is no new cost to taxpayers. Well, every dollar we take away from taxpayers is a cost to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is tuition up 43 percent? We are looking at the wrong issue. As long as the government keeps throwing money, then the institutions are going to keep expanding what they charge. I have used myself as an example before, but I know many people who have done this. They went to college and never borrowed a dime. They were as poor as could be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should call this the new Democrat welfare bill. It is a Trojan horse. It is designed to fool the American people. We have used this analogy before. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig, and that is what this bill is. There is no need for this. There is no need for people to go into debt to go to college in this country. There are all kinds of choices for people. All we are doing is taking money away from hardworking American people and creating new government programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am really concerned about the direction in which we are heading in this country. The Democrats have never seen a welfare program they didn't like. Republicans were able to decrease welfare costs when they took over in this body in 1995. This is another attempt by the Democrats to continue the welfare program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want Americans to have access to education. I have worked in education all my life: school board member, university administrator, college president. I have dealt with low-income students. This is not the way to do it. We don't need a return to the nanny state.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds  to say that I find it unbelievable that Republicans would decide that families that are making every sacrifice to borrow money, and students that are making every sacrifice to borrow and pay back money, that somehow they are called welfare recipients. These are hardworking American families who are struggling to educate their children, and I want to disassociate myself from that  kind of characterization of these families or these students.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I'd like to thank Chairman Miller for his leadership in bringing to the floor the largest single investment in college financial aid since the GI Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we are considering here increases the maximum Pell Grant by $500. It will cut the interest rate on student loans in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides loan forgiveness for college graduates that agree to teach in high-need areas and who agree to go into public service professions. It accomplishes all of that, and yet here is the best part: this bill saves the American taxpayers $750 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By reducing the excessive subsidies that Congress has lavished on private lenders, lenders that we have seen in the news this year have acted unscrupulously time and again, Chairman Miller has more than paid for the investments he is making in our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that my constituents in Rhode Island who take out Federal students loans will appreciate the $4,420 in savings this bill provides to them. And I also know that the rest of my constituents will appreciate the fact that this increase in student aid does not cost them one extra dime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Democrats took control in Congress, we promised to cut student loan interest rates in half, while at the same time proceeding in a fiscally responsible fashion.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. By passing this bill today, we make the largest single investment in higher education since the 1944 GI bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for acknowledging me. I am happy to rise in support of this bill here today. A conversation I heard a short while ago from my colleagues that there are some people in America who are taking welfare and don't need to have public assistance to go on to college are probably not thinking of the same America that I am thinking of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am thinking of the America where college costs have gone up 41 percent after inflation, and that is just for public higher education. I am thinking of the America where parents are working two jobs on many occasions, the students are working, and they still can't afford the cost of a public higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am thinking of the America that has not raised the value of a Pell Grant for many, many years, and we have a chance here to do just that. I am looking at a bill and supporting a bill that in fact will raise the Pell Grants, is going to lower the interest rate on student loans, both of which are necessary for many, many families in this country. I am talking for businesses as well as families. This is a chance not just to help the individuals, but to help our economy.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400318" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, and I'd like to share an alternative Republican viewpoint on the bill before us this afternoon. Traditionally, Republicans have stood for budgetary responsibility and competition to ensure a good return on taxpayer investment in Federal programs. I believe that this bill, while not perfect, is something that any Republican who stands for these principles should support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, I have spoken out against the excess subsidies that taxpayers pay to lenders in the guaranteed loan program. Government and private economists, including those in the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office and the Treasury Department, have all confirmed the significant inefficiencies in the program due to the arbitrary and capricious nature in which lender subsidies have been set over the last 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, these scorekeepers have found that taxpayers spend $3 to $5 billion each year on unnecessary subsidies that could be better applied as direct aid to students. The status quo on lender subsidies is inefficient, wasteful and unacceptable, and I applaud the effort made in this bill to redirect these resources primarily as Pell Grants and interest rate reductions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also contains two other critically important provisions that  largely have been overlooked in this debate. First, it includes an amendment that I offered and which was unanimously adopted in committee to study and implement a pilot program using market-based reforms, such as auctions, to bring down the cost to taxpayers in the guaranteed loan program. The reason we find ourselves needing to redirect these subsidies in the first place is due  to the fact that Congress set subsidy rates blindly and irresponsibly, not based on any market considerations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a free-market Republican, I believe Congress has no business setting lender returns. Other mechanisms, such as auctions, will actually capture market demands to obtain the optimal rate for taxpayers and for lenders. Given the tremendous waste, fraud and unethical relationships that have been uncovered in this program over the last 6 months, it's clear that the guaranteed loan program is fundamentally and structurally flawed. This study and pilot are key to comprehensively reforming this program  to ensure it serves students and taxpayers. And I'd like to thank the chairman and the committee for their strong support for this important effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, this bill applies a small portion of the savings towards improving income-contingent student loan repayment. Earlier this year, I introduced the IDEA Act, <bill type="h" number="2465">H.R. 2465</bill>, to make key changes to our current, limited income-contingent loan repayment program. The bill would make this repayment model accessible to all borrowers and better address the growing debt burdens which our students are graduating with. Some of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that this repayment model was actually  developed by free-market economist Milton Friedman as the optimal way for all students, no matter their income, to repay their student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act includes several provisions included in my legislation to improve this program, such as a 15 percent cap on adjusted income payments and moving the floor from 100 to 150 percent of the poverty level. These are positive first steps towards implementing a viable income-contingent repayment program, and I hope my colleagues will consider cosponsoring the IDEA Act to develop a loan repayment system for the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague for yielding me this time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of reducing the cost of higher education and increasing access for all of those who dream of attending college, and that includes, Mr. Speaker, our servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our servicemembers face extraordinary challenges when activated to go to Iraq or Afghanistan while in college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law, those deciding not to return to school must begin to repay the loan immediately after returning home, and this means, as we all know, that they will receive their student loan bills in the mail within days of returning from a combat zone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the other benefits in this bill, the College Cost Reduction Act includes an amendment to give those activated while in college a 13-month deferment before they must begin repaying a student loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is important, and it's important for this reason, because it provides our servicemembers the protections and the rights they deserve when activated while in college.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every single American, no matter what circumstances he or she comes from, deserves the opportunity to earn a college degree, but this opportunity should not come at the cost of years of crippling financial debt. That's why the time has come for this Congress to ease the education burden by increasing Pell Grants, reducing interest rates and closing the gap between college costs and financial aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the fifth time in 6 years, the college system in California raised tuition. In fact, this fall, students at Sonoma State University in my district will be required to pay nearly $3,000 more a year in tuition. That's a 10 percent increase from their current tuition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to do better. We need to work with our colleges to keep costs low. We need to invest in financial aid, and today, we are finally doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it's going to cost $18 billion to help this financial aid increase; $18 billion, about the same as 6 weeks of our occupation in Iraq.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400385" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a truly historic debate on the difference of philosophy of government. We agree on much of what's in this bill. In fact, my friend from Texas, Congressman Ron Paul, is a purist, capitalist, libertarian, but in fact, we've always had a blended government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the question is, whether it's through tax incentives, direct spending or loans, we've had a blended economy from the days of building canals and from our beginning; the question is, which way are we going to tilt? Is it going to be a capitalist tilt, or is the tilt going to be government running this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe, and I understand that likely today I'm going to lose, I'm going to be on the losing side, but I want to go on record pointing out how in fact extreme this bill is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a section, a provision of this bill, however well-intentioned, that reverses the normal role of trying to balance what you purchase with your ability to repay. It's an income-based section 133 open-ended entitlement benefit, regardless of profession, that allows them to cap the maximum loan payment each year at 150 percent of discretionary income and have the remainder of the loan forgiven after 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the bill, this means a typical entry-level Hill staffer earning $25,000 a year would never be forced to pay more than $120 a month on their student loans. This would no doubt be popular to our staff, but the American taxpayer I don't believe would approve of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An income-based repayment program would eliminate once and for all any need for students to weigh their choice of college or university against which type of career they plan to enter after the degree. It's a disconnect with capitalism because you don't have to say, if I get this number of degrees and go this far, how is my job going to repay this? Should I go to a local campus?  Should I go to a lower priced college? It's disconnected now based from  your choice of employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the government surely has a role in increasing access to education, this program would totally strip any incoming college student from making a responsible choice. It's kind-hearted but reckless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final example to strengthen the point. Say someone leaves school with an advanced degree and $120,000 of loan debt and takes a job making a steady $65,000 a year. He or she, if they selected to become part of this program, making $65,000 a year and made only minimum monthly payments, using the current 6.8 percent interest rate, the required monthly payment under the program would not even cover the interest on the loan, so that, 20 years later, they would have their $150,000 forgiven, even  though they had been making $65,000 a year. That's because the median income in the United States is only $46,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that we should work with low-income students through Pell Grants, and I support many parts of this bill in targeting, but when you disconnect the economic decisions that you make on your graduate degrees, on what profession and what college, it is State-controlled, economic controlled, not capitalism.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this investment in America. In spite of what we have heard from the other side about a spending plan, what we are really looking at is an investment in education, for those individuals who, without it, would never have an opportunity to experience a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard some things that I thought were unimaginable this afternoon. Eighty percent of the students in my district who attend the University of Illinois rely upon financial aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides money for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that are falling apart, many of them, at the seams, Hispanic-serving institutions. Individuals who would never, ever get an opportunity to go to college and experience higher education will do so as a result of this legislation, this investment in America. I thank the chairman for a great bill, and I urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First let me express my sincere appreciation to Chairman Miller, and Subcommittee Chairman Hinojosa for their efforts in introducing this landmark legislation to Congress. In my tenure as a Congressional representative for the citizens of the 7th District of Illinois, this is one of, if not the most critical national policy initiative for which I have been able to advocate. Why? Because in my district for example, approximately 80 percent of the students attending the University  of Illinois rely on financial aid programs to support their education, and this bill provides the single largest increase in college aid to students across the country since the GI Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act increases the maximum Pell Grant scholarship by at least $500 over the next 5 years, and I am pleased that an amendment which I cosponsored added $900,000,000 to the pool; invests in Upward Bound, a proven effective program that empowers students with the resources they need to help them succeed as they pursue higher education; and invests substantial appropriations in historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled,  Native and predominately black institutions and American and Asian American Pacific institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Detractors will try to paint this as another spending boondoggle by the Democrats, but this bill benefits students and families at no new cost to taxpayers by cutting excess subsidies the Federal government pays to lenders in the student loan industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may ask why we didn't just focus on Pell Grants, but the fact remains that families who don't qualify for Pell Grants still need assistance paying for college costs, and that approximately 50 percent of students who do qualify for Pell Grants borrow money to pay for college costs. The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 is the national policy initiative which demonstrates that America recognizes its responsibility to provide an educational environment that inspires and supports the pursuit  of academic excellence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from the district in Connecticut that's the home of the University of Connecticut, Eastern Connecticut State University, three community colleges, Conn. College, Mitchell College. We are the higher ed district of the State of Connecticut. New loan assistance and aid through grants in the amount of $130 million will be coming to Connecticut as a result of this measure being passed, which, again, is great news for my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, this bill is about something more than just parochial priorities, which are very important to my district. It's also about the change of direction that this new Congress is keeping faith with with passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I campaigned last year as a challenger in the closest race in America, the decision of the last Congress to take $12 billion out of the higher education account and use it to raise interest rates on student loans for the  purpose of making sure that the Paris Hilton stratum of American society was going to get their tax cuts was a perfect symbol for how out of touch the prior Congress was with the needs of America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students from working families, especially those who are the first in their families to attend college, face many obstacles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, there is no one at home to say the SATs aren't that difficult or that tricky; or that financial aid forms aren't going to be a nightmare to fill out; or that taking out a student loan isn't as scary as it might seem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The high cost of college is, of course, the biggest obstacle. In recent years, rising college tuitions have far outstripped inflation, and the previous congressional majority failed to ensure that Pell Grants kept up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I am proud to support this bill. It provides the single largest investment in higher education since the GI Bill at no new cost to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My mother and father, both immigrants who arrived in the U.S. with little money, and not knowing English, raised seven children. With a lot of hard work and sacrifice, all of us attended college and two even made it into Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I really like about this bill is that it ensures that the doors that were open to my brothers and sisters and me will stay open for the young people of today and generations to come.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This legislation will provide the single largest investment in college financial aid since the 1944 GI Bill, helping millions of low- and middle-income students and families pay for college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would provide about $18 billion over the next 5 years in college financial aid at no cost to the United States taxpayers, no new costs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think this has been a very interesting debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the beginning of the debate, I asked our colleagues to please listen carefully for anything they might hear that would lower tuition rates, that would lower the cost of a college education. I have listened very carefully, and I haven't heard anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard a lot of talk about investment, I have heard a lot of talk about new spending, and a lot of these things sound wonderful. It reminds me kind of when I would take my children to sit on Santa Claus's knee. He would ask them what they want. They would tell him all the wonderful things, and many times I wished I could have been Santa Claus and just give them all that they wanted. Sometimes it comes back to reality and the parents have to make some tough decisions based on our budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think people that are listening to this debate realize that there is no free lunch. With all of the new programs, nine new entitlement programs, somebody is going to have to pay for those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just entreat those who are watching to not create nine new entitlements, to place the interests of colleges, universities, graduates, philanthropic organizations above the needs of low-income students. Let's not put this price on our children and our grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the members of the committee for their work on this legislation on both sides of the aisle. I certainly want to thank the staff as we finish general debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we said when we gained the majority in this Congress that we wanted to take America in a new direction. This legislation, in fact, does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 6.8 million students who take out need-based loans, this legislation will allow for cutting the interest rate in half over the next 5 years for those students. That will save them almost $4,400 on the average debt that they graduate with. For almost 5.5 million students who rely on a Pell Grant for the basic cost of their education, this means that over the next 4 years that grant will increase by some $500, definitely a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because what we saw in the past was the Republicans made it more expensive to pay for your student loans. They provided little or no contribution to the Pell Grant over the last 4 or 5 years. That is a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does it mean to America? It means that we are investing in the students and the talent of the future. It means that these are the young people that will take their talents and provide the next generation of discovery, the next generation of innovation, the next generation of jobs in America, the next generation of economic activity here at home. That's the investment that was made by our grandparents back in 1944, in that generation, the first generation to go to college in such great numbers  with the GI Bill, and that's the investment that we have the courage and the vision to make in this generation of young people for the future of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's what this legislation is about. It's about making sure that the doors of a higher education that every employer tells us is now necessary to come to the American workplace if you want a career and you want a decent wage and you want to be able to provide for your family. The doors to those higher education institutions, be they community colleges, State colleges, universities or elite universities, however you want to characterize them, that those doors will not be closed to people who  are talented and ready and qualified to go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides the means to ensure their access to help them pay for it and to help them make sure that they don't have to make choices against their best interest because of  that debt and later in life that they can choose to go into the professions that serve us as a society. This is a dramatic departure, a dramatic departure from the status quo, a dramatic departure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the Republicans did, when they had a chance, they had $20 billion. They decided they would help pay for the tax cuts to the wealthiest people in the country. That's what they did with a big chunk of the money that they took from these excess subsidies, the subsidies that we are taking a way from the banks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The entitlement program that the banks have today as we stand here will be changed. Yes, it will become an entitlement program for America's families, America's students, those most at need in this country. That's what this Congress ought to be doing. That's what this society wants us to do, and we're going to do it today when we pass this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic piece of legislation is the relief our working families have been waiting for and I am proud to stand with this Democratic-led Congress to make college educations more accessible for our youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Housing, gas, food, utilities, and health insurance prices are going through the roof. Our middle-class parents are working overtime to keep up with the cost of living and hopefully save for retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has become increasingly difficult for our families to save for college. With tuition prices increasing an average of 3.5 percent each year, American families are facing an uphill battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, more and more of our children are coming out of school with staggering amounts of debt and many are being forced to attend part-time in order to work and pay for books and student fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of California, the average 4-year public school student will walk away with over $15,000 in debt after graduation. This is not how we should be sending our youth into the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> is going to slash the interest rates on student loans, saving the average American student about $4,400 in interest payments over the life of their loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, we're going to help our families take on less student debt by making Pell Grants keep up with the real cost of tuition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Republican-controlled Congress, the maximum Pell Grant amount remained unchanged at $4,050 since 2003. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> is going to increase that figure to $4,310 in 2007 alone. By next year, it will be $4,900 and by 2011, it will be $5,200.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of California, over 600,000 Pell Grant recipients stand to benefit from the legislation we're going to pass today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That means our children will be in a better position to save for retirement, become homeowners, and contribute to the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> will also make landmark investments to our minority serving institutions. Black, Hispanic, Tribal, Native Hawaiian, and Asian-Pacific Islander-serving institutions stand to receive $500 million in aid to teach and equip our minority youth, particularly in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> provides an additional $228 million for Upward Bound, which will fund 188 additional programs to help prepare low-income, first generation students for college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> will provide loan forgiveness for students who pursue careers as public school teachers. Each would receive up-front tuition assistance of $4,000 per year, to a maximum of $16,000. This will provide aid to at least 21,500 undergraduate and graduate students who commit to teaching a high-need subject in high-need schools for four years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the youngest of 15 children, I was the first in my family to attend college. I can tell you from personal experience that it has made all the difference in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I worked hard to get through school and I'm grateful for the assistance I received to complete my education. And it's time for the government to step up and give our children the same support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act is the kind of reform my constituents need and I am proud to support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same and support <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400179" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, The College Cost Reduction Act. I urge all of my colleagues to vote "yes" on the largest investment in student aid since the passage of the GI bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act re-affirms the fundamental federal interest in higher education--ensuring that students and families have access to the financial and other supports they need to achieve a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fundamental guaranty in our student aid programs is not to protect lucrative lines of business in the lending industry; it is a guaranty of college access for students. When we lose sight of this core principle, we lose our way as we have seen with the recent scandals in the student loan industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> is about guaranteeing access. This legislation increases student financial aid on an order of magnitude we have not seen in more than a generation. It invests in our public servants and in our teachers. It brings the private sector and charitable organizations to the table to leverage resources so that more first generation, low-income college students can realize their full potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly proud of our work to strengthen the institutions that are the gateways of access to higher education for minority students. Through this amendment we will commit to investing one-half billion dollars over 5 years in hispanic-serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, predominantly black institutions, tribally-controlled Colleges and Universities, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian serving Institutions, and institutions that serve Asian and Pacific Islanders.  This represents a doubling of the current investment in the strengthening and developing institutions programs in Titles III and V of the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many on the other side will say that we are investing in institutions and not students. They will rail against new entitlement spending. These arguments reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the communities that will fuel the growth in our workforce. Worse, they indicate an unwillingness to invest in those communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HSls, HBCUs, and other minority-serving institutions are only going to grow in their importance for ensuring that our Nation continues to have enough college graduates to fill the jobs in our knowledge-based economy. The 2007 Condition of Education reports that 42 percent of our public school children are racial or ethnic minorities--one in five is Hispanic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These students face many challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventy percent of black 4th graders, 73 percent of Hispanic 4th graders, and 65 percent of Native American 4th graders are eligible for free and reduced priced lunches. These students are also concentrated in our highest poverty public schools where over 75 percent of the students are from low-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These schools are the focus of the No Child Left Behind Act. They are the feeder schools to our Title III and Title V institutions. It is in our national interest to strengthen the capacity of these institutions to serve their communities. It is a worthy investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Chairman Miller on this legislation, which provides the single largest investment in higher education since the GI bill--at no new cost to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that this Democratic Congress has tackled the college cost crisis: the time to act is now. Over the last 5 years, college costs have grown by nearly 40 percent. Students across the country are graduating with more and more debt. In my home state of New York, the typical student with need-based loans graduates from 4-year public schools with over $14,000 in debt. And each year nearly 200,000 students in our country hold off on attending college, or opt out altogether, simply because  they cannot afford to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This historic bill would make college more affordable by cutting interest rates on subsidized student loans in half over the next 5 years. In New York, this means an average student saves $4,570 over the life of their loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will also increase the purchasing power of the Pell Grant Scholarship, upping the maximum scholarship by at least $500 over the next 4 years and ultimately reaching a maximum scholarship of at least $5,200 by 2011. In New York, this increased purchasing power could directly help over 420,000 students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the College Cost Reduction Act, students from New York and all across the country will be better able to achieve their goals and reach their dreams. Our Nation and our economy also benefit when we strengthen the middle class by making college more affordable. I am proud to cast my vote for this historic bill, which makes a tremendous step towards ensuring that no one is denied the opportunity to go to college simply because of the price.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> (the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007), a bill that is good for students and good for the Federal budget. Our budget resolution for fiscal year 2008 included reconciliation instructions for the House Committee on Education and Labor to cut its spending by $750 million by 2012, and this bill more than fulfills that target. In fact, this reconciliation bill will reduce the Federal Government's budget  deficit  by $2.8 billion over the next 5 years while investing billions of dollars in making college more affordable for millions of students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the first actions of the 110th Congress was to institute a tough pay-as-you-go rule in the House that requires all changes to mandatory spending and revenues to be offset so that they do not lower the budget's bottom line. The rule was necessary to help restore fiscal balance, and it requires Congress to make tough choices about priorities. This bill adheres to the pay-as-you-go rule--with net savings of $2.8 billion over the 2007-2012 period and even greater savings over 2007-2017--while  also providing needed improvements in student loans and grant aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like previous reconciliation bills, the College Cost Reduction Act includes some new resources that are more than offset by cuts elsewhere. All of the new resources in the bill will make college more affordable, either by lowering the cost of loans--up-front or through forgiveness after graduation--or by increasing the amount of grant aid available. But none of these resources will increase the deficit: the bill not only complies with our pay-as-you-go rule and the reconciliation directive but  actually reduces the deficit by $2.8 billion over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To pay for these student benefits, the bill reduces the extra subsidies that the government pays to banks. These reductions are similar to those in <bill type="h" number="5">H.R. 5</bill>, which passed the House in January by a bipartisan vote of 356-71, and to the subsidy cuts in the President's 2008 budget proposal. But the student loan business will continue to be an attractive one for banks, which are still guaranteed to receive 95 percent of unpaid principal on any defaulted loan and still receive a subsidy from the Federal  Government on each loan they provide.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="2269">H.R. 2269</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, the single largest investment in college financial aid since the 1944 GI bill. This legislation will help millions of middle- and low-income families and students pay for college without any new cost to taxpayers. At a time of skyrocketing tuition costs, government investment has not kept up. As college degrees become more expensive, we must help keep bright students in school and ensure a bright future  for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation boosts college financial aid by about $18 billion over the next 5 years, and pays for itself by reducing excessive federal subsidies paid to lenders in the college loan industry by $19 billion. Over the course of 5 years, almost 70,000 Oregon students would benefit from an additional $194 million in available loans and Pell Grants. The average Oregon student graduates with more than $14,000 in debt, and this legislation would cut by almost $5,000 the interest paid on their loans.  By investing in our students, we ensure a well-educated, globally competitive workforce. We also benefit our communities by providing incentives for our brightest to go into public service jobs and into our neediest schools.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This legislation will provide the single largest investment in higher education since the GI bill, helping low- and middle-income students and families pay for college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, too many Maine students do not obtain a postsecondary education because they cannot afford the dramatically escalating costs of higher education. This legislation is a historic opportunity to put education goals within reach for many students by increasing funding for Pell Grants, cutting interest rates on subsidized student loans, and increasing funding for Upward Bound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there are provisions within the underlying bill to protect small lenders, I will continue to work hard to ensure that the small lenders in Maine, including the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME), are protected in the final legislation. FAME has provided many Maine students the opportunity to go on to postsecondary education and it's important to ensure that they, and other small lenders, are able to continue to provide the best service possible for Maine students.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Not since 1944, with the GI Bill, has Congress taken such a proactive step in ensuring that millions of Americans can attend higher education institutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to start providing our students with the aid needed to keep America competitive by strengthening the middle class and increasing diversity on our campuses. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> will allow middle class and minority families to have access to quality education by increasing grant aid and lessening the burden of loans. Along with <bill type="h" number="5">H.R. 5</bill>, this legislation ensures that our students will finally have the funding for higher education that has long been denied them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will increase the Pell Grant by $500, benefiting 646,000 students in my home state of California. In addition, 6.8 million students nationwide who take out need-based federal student loans would see the interest rates cut in half, providing California alone with over $1.4 billion more in loan and Pell aid. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> not only puts and keeps students in college--it strengthens our communities by providing financial assistance to people entering public service careers, like nurses, police,  firefighters, first responders, and teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For students in Los Angeles, this is real dollars in the pockets of those who need it most. Since 1980 the Latino population in the United States has doubled, but Latinos attending college has only increased 5 percent during this same period. Latinos continue to face numerous obstacles on the road to college. Low family incomes, low financial aid awards and a reluctance to assume debt has hindered Latinos for too long in achieving their higher education goals. The College Cost Reduction Act helps  support those institutions helping Latino students by guaranteeing $500 million over 5 years for Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Financial assistance was critical to my ability to obtain a higher education and I am proud that <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, will help Latinos and other low income students get the financial security to pursue their dreams.

    <paragraph>This landmark legislation will provide vital assistance to low- and middle-income students by increasing the Pell Grant Scholarship by $500 over the next 5 years. In the State of Texas alone, over 470,000 could benefit from this increase.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, a report by Michigan's Lt. Governor John Cherry's Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth laid out how two-thirds of the jobs created in the next decade will require post-secondary education and training. There is little debate that Michigan's economic future is directly linked to our ability to accelerate the completion of degrees in higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite increasing costs across the country and in our state, our federal investment in higher education has faltered. Direct grant aid, which once made up roughly 60 percent of the federal government's student aid contribution has dropped to 40 percent, with the remaining 60 percent offered through loans. The real dollar value of Pell Grants has sunk in recent years, while the average college graduate is now faced with close to $17,500 in debt. For lower and middle income students and families  these costs are simply too great, forcing nearly 200,000 to delay or postpone their college dreams because of the prohibitive costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has become increasingly clear that the failure of the federal government to adequately invest in higher education will have effects beyond college accessibility. In 2005, the National Academies of Sciences released a report entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm" which expressed deep concern that our country is losing its competitive advantage in science and technology research, two fields that are critical to our economic leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The seriousness of our higher education crisis necessitates a comprehensive response of dramatic proportions. The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 rises to this challenge by investing $18 billion over the next 5 years in higher education, the single largest investment in college financial aid since the GI Bill in 1944.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The maximum Pell Grant is boosted $500 to $5,200--up from just $4,050 in 2006--with its eligibility expanded to more students. TEACH grants are established to provide $4,000 per year for high-achieving students who commit to teach in high-need schools or high-need fields--like math and science. The interest rates for need-based student loans would be halved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Michigan, over 200,000 students could see benefits from the Pell increases and about 144,000 student borrowers with subsidized loans would see savings of over $4,200 on average over the life of their loans. This bill provides close to $513 million in loans and grants to Michigan's students and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investments in this bill maintain the commitment made by this Democratic Congress to fiscal responsibility. The bill is fully offset by trimming excessive federal subsidies to lenders in the college loan industry. Not only will this not cost taxpayers a dime, it includes $750 million over 5 years to pay down our national deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act meets the mounting hurdle of higher education affordability with vigorous across-the-board grant aid and loan investments. It shows the commitment by this Congress to the availability of a college education and the importance of this education to our economic competitiveness. Improving access to higher education is vital to expanding opportunity for Michigan students and building Michigan's economic future. This has to be an ongoing priority for the federal government  and this legislation is an important step in the right direction. With this legislation, Congress has stepped up to the plate to ensure a better future for our students, their families and our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have always believed students must have the opportunity to earn degrees based on their academic accomplishments rather than on their economic situation. Today's economy demands a highly educated work force, which is why Congress must ensure we are providing educational access to every qualified student that wants to attend college. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act, will do just that by making the single largest investment in college financial aid since the  1944 GI Bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard from many of my constituents that the daunting costs of a college education are preventing them from achieving a college degree. They are not alone. Nearly 200,000 students are holding off on going to college or forgoing college completely because they can't afford it. In the last 5 years tuition at 4-year public colleges has grown by 35 percent, forcing both students and their families to take on increasing amounts of debt to pay for college. At a time when Michigan's economy and  workforce is struggling, a college education should not be a luxury that is unreachable for middle-class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Democrats took the majority this year, we committed to making college more affordable and accessible. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> will do this by cutting the interest rate from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over the next 5 years. Each year 6.8 million students take out need-based loans and accrue thousands of dollars of debt while completing their college degree. This legislation will cut in half the interest rates on their loans, saving the average student--with $13,800 in need-based student loan debt--$4,400  over the life of the loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> will also increase the maximum value of the Pell Grant scholarship by $500 over the next 5 years, ultimately reaching a maximum scholarship level of $5,200. As the Federal Government's single largest source of grant aid for college students, this proposed increase will directly benefit over 5 million low- and moderate-income students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More importantly, this legislation will prevent student borrowers from facing unmanageable levels of Federal student debt by guaranteeing borrowers will never have to spend more than 15 percent of their yearly discretionary income on loan repayments and by allowing borrowers who enter public service to have their loans forgiven after 10 years. This is critically important because students today are graduating from college with more debt than ever before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people may be asking how this will help those who are struggling in Michigan. In our great State of Michigan, over 143,000 students take out need-based loans each year. The average student has $13,256 in need-based student loan debt. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> will provide interest rate cuts that win save each Michigan student $4,240 over the life of their student loan. This legislation will also provide $513 million in increased loan and Pell Grant aid to students and families in Michigan over the next  five years--benefiting over 200,000 students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation not only because it will increase college affordability, but because it will help our workforce. Our economy depends on aggressive investment in our workforce if we want to continue to be competitive in a global economy. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation, showing American families that Congress is committed to investing in higher education.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412200" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask permission to revise and extend my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act, the largest increase in college aid since the G.I. bill, and I thank especially Chairman Miller for his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will make college more affordable and more accessible for students in Hawai`i and across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will do so at no new cost to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keeping America competitive requires an educated workforce prepared for high skilled jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond preparing our youth for careers, education is vital for the full development of an individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>College costs have skyrocketed beyond the means of many students and their families. As a result, many students in Hawai`i and elsewhere are holding off on going to college or skipping it altogether. And those who do attend college are taking on increasing amounts of debt, so this bill is of critical importance to the hard-working families I represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to mention a few other provisions in this legislation that are especially important to me: As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I worked to increase funding for colleges and universities serving Native Hawaiians and Alaska Natives by $30 million over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also included a $10 million investment in institutions serving Asian and Pacific Islander populations that historically have had low education attainment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation includes the provisions from my Early Educator Loan Forgiveness bill that provides college loan forgiveness for graduates who enter the field of early education to encourage more of them to pursue this field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons and more, I am proud to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the College Cost Reduction Act. I commend the Honorable GEORGE MILLER for introducing this much needed piece of legislation and for his leadership on this issue and education in general.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you all know, college costs in America are simply out of range for far too many Americans. The University of the Virgin Islands, a Historically Black University in my district, costs $10,000 per year while the median income of a Virgin Islands resident is $32,613. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see the problem. It is further amplified when examining my alma mater, the George Washington University. Tuition at George Washington for an undergraduate starting this fall will be $39,210  per year--a hefty sum when considering that the median income of need-based federal loan borrowers in 2003-2004 was $45,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This welcome legislation will raise the maximum value of the Pell Grant Scholarship by $500, thus increasing its purchasing power and benefiting roughly 5.5 million low- and moderate-income students. And this is only the beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act will also cut in half interest rates on need-based student loans which so often become an unnecessary burden over the heads of those just starting out in their respective professions. In lowering the interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over the next five years, we are saving the average student borrower $4,400 on their overall loan. The sad reality is that many students from middle class homes miss out on obtaining a secondary education because of a failure  on our part. Many middle class students have guardians that make too much money to qualify for Federal grants but not enough to actually provide needed financial support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every one of our children and indeed every American strive to reach the American dream. As their representatives, we must support them in this pursuit by granting middle class Americans every opportunity possible to obtain affordable higher education. This legislation will expand eligibility of grants by almost 600,000 students, thus, helping to end the unfair burden many students from middle class homes now face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colleagues, I urge you to support this needed legislation. The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 will be the single largest increase in secondary education support by the United States Government since the GI Bill--and it will not cost the American tax payer one cent. Our young people are America's future. It is critical that we invest in that future.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400387" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This bill provides the largest single investment in higher education since the  Montgomery GI Bill of 1944, with no new cost to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Federal financial aid programs fail to meet the needs of many students. That means a college education is unattainable for many young people. Public university students can only expect one-third of the cost of attendance at a 4-year institution to be covered by the Pell grant, down from two-thirds of the cost covered in 1980. This bill makes higher education more affordable by increasing the maximum Pell grant by $500 and increasing the number of eligible students by over half a million.  These improvements are long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to strengthening Pell grants, this bill builds on other existing Federal student aid programs to help provide our next generation with a chance to succeed. It lowers Federal loan interest rates to improve accessibility and ease the growing debt burden of graduates. In 2004, one-fourth of all graduating students with loans carried more than $25,000 in loan debt. Perversely, last year the Republican-controlled Congress enacted the largest reduction ever to Federal student aid programs  to finance tax cuts for the rich. The College Cost Reduction Act--H.R. 2669--begins to reverse failed Republican policies by reducing the Federal interest rate on student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must strengthen our education system if we hope to compete in a global economy. In addition to making college more financially feasible, careers in public service need to be rewarded. Quality elementary and secondary teachers are essential to our public school system, but in 2003-2004 their median salary was only $31,704. Teachers deserve more than pats on the back. This bill provides upfront tuition assistance for aspiring educators who commit to teaching high-need subjects in underperforming  schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill pays for itself by reducing some of the massive fees paid to the scandal-plagued student loan industry. Instead of subsidizing the profits of lenders, this bill puts money in the hands of low- and middle-income students. Not surprisingly, President Bush is siding with the big lenders and he's threatened to veto this essential legislation. He and the Republicans in Congress continue to obstruct real progress in education and almost every other domestic priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must address the rising cost of higher education, reinvest in our schools by attracting new teachers, and cultivate the next generation of American leaders. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for America's future and supporting this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to quality higher education is the key to the American dream for working families. Unfortunately, college costs have skyrocketed in recent years even as many fine colleges and universities, like those in North Carolina, have gone to great lengths to keep higher education affordable. The Federal Government has an obligation to step up to the plate and provide more assistance, and <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> makes  several important changes to the Federal student financial assistance effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> would provide nearly $18 billion in college financial aid at no new cost to the taxpayers. The bill would increase the maximum Pell grant scholarship for low-income and moderate-income students by $500 over the next 5 years. It would cut in half the interest rate on need-based Federal student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over 5 years. This will save the typical borrower some $4,400 over the life of the loan. This provision alone could benefit more than 162,000  students in North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> would make historic investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities--HBCUs--with $170 million in new grants for HBCUs, such as Shaw University and Fayetteville State University, in my congressional district. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> also would create a new designation of Predominantly Black Institutions, which are defined as schools that enroll students in financial need and have at least 40 percent African-American student enrollment. These schools would be eligible to receive $30 million  in grant aid over 5 years for academic programs in the fields of science, technology, engineering, health education, and teacher education. This legislation would provide $228 million in funding over 4 years for Upward Bound that increases high school completion, college participation, and graduation rates among low-income and first-generation college students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I enthusiastically support the bill's tuition assistance for excellent undergraduate students who agree to teach in the Nation's public schools and its loan forgiveness for college graduates that go into public service professions. In addition, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> would make important new investments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics--STEM--education that is so critical to our prosperity in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Miller and his outstanding professional staff, especially Gaby Gomez, Denise Forte, and Mark Zuckerman, for working with me to help nonprofit lenders, like we have in North Carolina. Specifically, this bill provides non-profit and small lenders a significant boost to their bottom line earnings and their ability to compete with for-profit lenders. These lenders will save $85 million in the first year to re-invest in their college aid financing and nearly $500  million over 5 years to serve students even better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the legislative process moves forward, I want to continue to work with Chairman Miller to ensure that cuts to lender subsidies do not result in North Carolina students paying more for their loans than they do today. I am confident the final product will achieve that result, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to pass <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is such an exciting day. Today, we say to the nearly 200,000 students every year who do not attend college for financial reasons, you deserve better. You deserve better than outdated financial aid packages, crippling debt, and empty promises of support once you graduate. Today we are delivering on that promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Higher education has become increasingly important in this country and around the world, yet it has been rapidly slipping from the grasp of thousands and thousands of students every year. Over the past several years, states have cut higher education funding and in many cases, passed that cost on to students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Student loans, which for two-thirds of our students average $20,000, not only affect student's financial viability down the road, they effect the range of opportunities that are available to new graduates as they seek out professions that will enable them to repay their loans. Education is supposed to be the gateway to opportunity, not the path to financial ruin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important provisions of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> is an expansion of eligibility and an increase in the Pell grant scholarship to $5,200 over the next 5 years. This bill will also encourage and enable graduates to go into the public service fields they're interested in--and which our country so desperately needs--by providing loan forgiveness for first responders, early childhood educators, librarians, nurses, public defenders, and public prosecutors. These professions are some of the most important  to our communities, yet they are chronically undersupported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will also provide tuition assistance to students who commit to teaching in public schools, high-poverty communities, and high-need subject areas. It also makes a landmark investment in Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Tribally Controlled, Native or Predominately Black Institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By redirecting excessive Federal subsidies for lenders in the student loan industry, these new commitments will come at no additional cost to taxpayers. It's time that taxpayer dollars go towards our student's future--and the future of our competitiveness as a nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this remarkable legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400427" topic="TITLE IV--LEVERAGING FUNDS TO INCREASE COLLEGE ACCESS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in support of efforts to make college education more affordable for more Americans. Indeed earlier this year I voted in support of <bill type="h" number="5">H.R. 5</bill>, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. I believed that bill took some positive steps and was pleased to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very disappointed that the bill before us, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, falls far short of its goal. While those who drafted the bill assert that it is a comprehensive solution to making college more affordable, <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> fails to address the core problem of access to U.S. colleges and universities: sky-rocketing rates of tuition and room and board. In just the last 7 years, yearly inflation has increased on average 2.7 percent. However, higher education costs for students has increased an average of 4.2  percent--a rate that is 55 percent higher than regular inflation. This bill makes it easier for students to borrow more money to face these costs, but it does nothing to fix the root problem. And, the end result will be that under <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the average college student graduating from college 4 years</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, those attending college in the future will be able to borrow more money and perhaps pay a lower interest rate, but with college expenses growing at a rate that far exceeds the annual inflation rate, students will end college with a significantly larger debt. By failing to address this fundamental problem, this bill avoids the major issue facing families and college students. It is due to this obvious omission that I could not vote for final passage of this bill.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H7545]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> will enable students to take on more debt which will further burden them for many years past graduation. In 2006, the Higher Education Price Index, HEPI, calculation showed that inflation for colleges and universities jumped to 5 percent. This is 30 percent higher than the regular inflation rate. When colleges and universities know that students have access to more funds through financial aid, loans, and grants they have simply seen this as an opportunity to raise costs for students.  This was the case in the past and it is likely to happen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does nothing to discourage colleges and universities from further inflating their tuition rates. In fact, it will do the opposite. If we truly want to help our students go into the world with a good education and saddled with less debt, we should hold colleges and universities who take government aid more accountable and not allow them to continue their excessive increases in college costs. Our students deserve better.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if bridging the gap between low-income students and their dream of a college education is a primary goal of this House, then this substitute should be adapted with ease. That's because this amendment nearly doubles the Pell Grant increase provided by the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It makes Pell funding available year around for students seeking to finish their degrees more quickly by taking summer courses, which also makes a savings for them, and it eliminates a role that needlessly punishes students attending low-cost schools by limiting the amount of Pell Grant funds they can receive each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First some background. Less than a third of savings in the underlying bill, roughly $6 billion, is directed to the most successful student aid program on the books today, the Pell Grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, more funds under the base bill are directed toward those who are, by definition, no longer even students. This is done by temporarily phasing down interest rates on certain loans being repaid by college graduates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The remaining third of the bill triggers billions of dollars in new entitlement spending, including nine new areas of entitlement spending all together. In fact, some of this new spending is not even directed towards students, but rather to institutions, like colleges, universities, and philanthropic organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Pell Grant substitute will tip the balance back toward low-income students struggling to pay for their college education by increasing the maximum Pell Grant far more than the underlying bill. Specifically, it would provide for $9 billion in additional funding for Pell Grants over the next 5 years. Again, that's nearly double what the underlying bill would do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's how we do it. This Pell Grant proposal adopts the same cut to lender insurance rates from 97 to 95 percent as the underlying bill, while having the same goal of reducing administrative fees paid to guaranteed agencies as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this substitute would save the Federal Government about $11 billion through lower special allowance payments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this structural savings is far more responsible than the underlying bill which, much like the President's fiscal year 2008 budget, fails to take into account the fact that Congress cut some $18 billion from the student loan programs just last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With these savings, more than $15 billion in total, this amendment corrects current law to equalize the Pell and direct loan rates for PLUS loans at 7.9 percent. It retains bipartisan language from the underlying bill to permit members of the Armed Forces the ability to defer their loans for up to 13 months upon returning from service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, it invests more than $9 billion in the Pell Grant program. This investment would allow us to increase the maximum Pell Grant by $350 in 2008, compared to the smaller increase in the underlying bill, and by $100 for each year thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, this measure would pay down the deficit by $5.74 billion. That's more than three times what the underlying bill would dedicate toward deficit reduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Also included in this substitute are key college cost reforms, including the College Affordability and Transparency Act legislation that I introduced earlier this year to arm parents and students with more information about college costs than ever before. The measure also would take important steps to insist that colleges and universities be held more accountable for their role in the college cost crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, through my substitute amendment, we would increase Pell, decrease the deficit, more directly address college costs and put in place a handful of other student benefits without creating a single new entitlement program. We would accomplish all of this without creating a new maze of rules and regulations for students, parents and institutions to navigate. And, we would accomplish all of this without shortchanging the low-income students who need the most help to get on the ladder to  achieve the American dream. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400437" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with just a minute or two of time, one of the saddest moments, one of the two saddest moments in my relatively brief career here in the United States House was when this Chamber acted at the President's request to cut $12 billion from college financial aid. That occurred the day after a State of the Union Address where the President talked about American competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we take a bold step in rectifying that error. And I just want to refer a moment to the other saddest day of my thus far 8 years in the House of Representatives, and that was the decision in this Chamber to go to war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those were the two saddest moments in my congressional career: Begin a war in error, and now perpetuating a pride. But at least today, at this moment, we are having an opportunity to rectify, in my view, the other great error that we committed during my time in this Chamber, and that is the $12 billion cut that the Education Committee passed, the prior majority passed in this Chamber, and that went into effect without a necessary 60-vote majority in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we can propose this greatest increase in college financial aid. We may or may not have the votes for cloture in the other Chamber, but this is the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do. It will make America more competitive. It will help individuals, and it will help our society, and we will rectify the errors we have made in the past one by one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Affordable access to quality post-secondary education is the best tool available to ensure success and the kind of career that can support a family. It is also critical that American students have the education that will help them remain competitive in an increasingly global and knowledge-based economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act provides a major funding increase to assist students and their families achieve the goal paying for college, and much more--at no new expense to taxpayers. It provides tuition assistance to undergraduates who commit to teaching in low-income communities or high-need subject areas. It rewards those who serve their communities--first responders and law enforcement officers, for example, by providing loan forgiveness to those that serve others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps most importantly, the bill provides a major help to students in my home state of Oregon. The bill expands Pell Grant eligibility, and the maximum Pell Grant scholarship is increased over $500. This means nearly 70,000 Oregonians could benefit from the bill. This translates into $194 million dollars in aid to Oregon students and families over five years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>College costs have skyrocketed over the past decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The College Cost Reduction Act is instrumental in helping more Americans achieve their dream of a college education. I strongly support this bill, and urge my colleagues to do so as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop) for 5 minutes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400031" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment of the ranking member, and I urge its defeat, and I urge our colleagues to vote in support of the underlying bill. I do so for several reasons; but before I talk about that, I would like to talk about some of the things that I have heard here today in the debate that disturbed me greatly and I think require being addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First is that I believe the ranking member, I am going to paraphrase him, but I think correctly said that we just can't help ourselves; that if you give us an opportunity to spend money, we are going to spend it. And I would rephrase that, and I would say that, we just can't help ourselves. If you give us an opportunity to solve a problem, we are going to solve it, and we are going to do so in a fiscally responsible way. And the problem that we are trying to solve with this underlying bill is  diminished access and affordability to higher education, a problem which, if we leave unaddressed, is going to have a very serious consequence in terms of our future and in terms of our security. And we are addressing this problem, as I say, in a fiscally responsible way. It will not cost the taxpayers one dime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also heard a great deal of talk about how we are not addressing the issue of entitlement spending and how we are creating nine new entitlements. Our mandatory budget represents about 60 or 70 percent of the total expenditures of this Nation, and it includes a number of so-called entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the national debt. And I would point out that, of all these programs, only one is truly mandatory, and that is interest on the national debt.  And that number has ballooned over the last 6 years under the watch of the then majority when they controlled every lever of power in this town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fiscal year 2001, interest on the national debt was $200 billion a year. Fiscal year 2007, interest on the national debt is $265 billion a year. And the total debt has grown by $3 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would simply say that it rings hollow to hear a lecture on fiscal responsibility and to be told that we are behaving in a way that is injurious to the American taxpayer when in fact our behavior is the antithesis of the behavior that has held sway this House for the last 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with the amendment here is what we would not get if we were to pass Mr. McKeon's amendment: We would get no reduction in interest rates, a condition that would influence students' decisions to attend colleges. There would be no increase in the Federal capital contribution for the Perkins loan program. I will repeat; this is a loan program that this administration is trying earnestly to kill in what is a terribly ill-advised move.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is this notion out there that the Federal capital contribution for Perkins will increase availability of Perkins loans. And to correct a common misperception, the Perkins loan program is not duplicative of the FFEL program or of the Direct Lending program. In fact, a great many students borrow from both programs. There would be no investment in cooperative education, a program that exposes students to the world of work and help enriches their college experience. There would be no investment  in placing a highly qualified teacher in every classroom, something that we absolutely must do if we are going to make the advances on the K-12 level that we simply must make, the advances that were contemplated by the No Child Left Behind legislation, advances that we now have the opportunity to put in place. And</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I believe that the College Cost Reduction Act is, as I said before, long overdue, much needed and will address some very serious concerns that currently confront college students and their families, and will do so in a fiscally responsible way. And I urge its passage, and I urge defeat of the amendment by Mr. McKeon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me say how relieved I am that the measure we are considering today does not incorporate the highly controversial STAR Act, which would turn over the entire Federal student loan program to Washington bureaucrats. I appreciate the chairman for not including that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to strongly support healthy competition between the government-run Direct Loan program and the market-based Pell program, and doing anything to upset that competition would be terrible for students, parents and taxpayers alike. Nonetheless, I would be remiss if I did not express some concerns about the extent of the Pell cuts in <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After cutting some $18 billion from our student loan program during a budget reconciliation process in the last Congress, an additional cut of more than $18.75 billion this year strikes me as overreaching. Though this figure is close to the President's cut in his latest budget proposal, I believe the administration itself went too far and gave very little consideration to the impact of the cuts we made in the last Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe supporters of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> did not take into account the impact the bill's cuts may have on student loan default rates. When I became chairman, 12 years ago, of this subcommittee over higher education, the default rates were running about 25 percent. And through competition and the things that we have worked on during that time, we have cut that rate to where now the default rate is running at about 5 percent. If it gets back up to those higher ranges again, that is going to cost  the American taxpayer another $11 billion a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans are already on record as having supported savings from some of the lender subsidies, and there may well be room to go even further. Later today, in my substitute, I offer cutting $15 billion, which is a little less than the underlying bill but may still be too high. Only time will tell. But we must be cautious to not overreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority often takes aim at student lenders and seeks continual and excessive cuts as a way to punish them for daring to make a profit. You know, businesses have to make a profit or they don't remain in business. And if they don't remain in business and making loans to students, running about $70 billion a year now, if they don't continue to make those loans, some would say, well, then the direct lending program can take it over, which means the Department of Education, which there have been  some criticisms of, would become the largest bank in the world, doing all of the student loan system. Early in my tenure here, they had to shut down their program because they couldn't keep up, and it was a much smaller program at the time. I have very great concerns of turning the whole student loan program over to the Department of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real victims in all of this debate are the smaller lenders. The large lenders, which is kind of a paradox because they are the ones that we seem to be going after, they will survive, and they will even get better. The small lenders that help those that need the small loans, it takes about $7,000 for a lender to make a profit on these loans. In my community, kids going to the community colleges need a much smaller loan. The tuition, the fees and everything run less than $1,000 a year. And  if they take out a loan to cover that, the lenders that are making that loan really aren't making any money; they are doing it as a service. They are not going to do that for long. When they keep getting hit with these kind of cuts, they will just get out of the program, and then, eventually, it will be turned over to the government-run program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just give a couple of examples here of the things I am concerned about. The Navy Federal Credit Union right here in Virginia that holds $280 million in Federal loans; or San Miguel Federal Credit Union that holds $140 million; or Simmons First National Bank in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, that holds $86 billion; or Sovereign Bank in Reading, Pennsylvania, that holds $79 million; Commerce Bank and Trust in Topeka, Kansas, that holds $60 million; or Zion's First National Bank in Salt Lake with</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in this great land of opportunity, wealth should not be a prerequisite for education, and it should not be a prerequisite for future success. For too many hardworking and qualified Americans, a college degree is the key to a successful career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And for millions more, that education sends them so deep into debt that raising a family is impossible. The College Cost Reduction Act will respond to this injustice with an unparalleled commitment in higher education. 140,000 students and families will save more than $200 million on tuition costs in my home State of Kentucky alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've heard a lot during this debate from our colleagues on the other side throwing the word around of "entitlement" as if "entitlement" is a dirty word. And I will grant that over the years, some entitlements have not been particularly productive, but entitlements can also be significant investments in not only human capital but in the future of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in this particular instance, what we are saying is we are going to make a dramatic step not just to improve the lives of millions of young Americans, but also to make an investment in their futures and the future of this economy. And if we don't do it, the great disparity in wealth between the most wealthy people in this country and everyone else will continue to grow, and we will face an economy in which we are not developing the type of talent that will keep this country at the stature  that it has always maintained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am firmly against and urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment. I strongly support the College Cost Reduction Act because this is ultimately an investment in our future as a country, as a great nation, and the future of many Americans who without this help will be destined to a mundane future, which will mean that our country will result in the same state.</paragraph>

I also want to commend him for his appreciation for how we approach education and how we approach access to education in this country. His work in the committee has not gone unnoticed, and we do appreciate that commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do rise today to support the McKeon substitute that we have before us, and I think that it addresses some of the problems that so many Members on both sides of the aisle have problems with in the underlying legislation. You cannot deny that there are nine new entitlement programs that are contained in the underlying legislation, and quite frankly, we have heard from so many people who have expressed concern over this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we are at a time when people talk about the need to reduce the size of the Federal Government, to reduce the bureaucracy, to reduce the number of programs, here comes a piece of legislation, and lo and behold, you're going to have nine new programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, there are so many that say, why would you do this? Why would you not do an assessment of the needs and then put the money where the needs are?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Mr. McKeon has done that, as he has addressed the Pell Grants and spending the funding, increasing the Pell Grants, which address the access component that is so important to our students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another component that is in there that I think many of the Members would be interested in is the changes that it makes in providing funds for year-round Pell Grants, there again answering a question and solving a problem that we hear from our constituents and the type Pell Grant program that they want, the access that they want, being certain that we're going to help those students who wish to pursue their education not only in the fall, not only in the spring, but the summer as well. We know  that this is very important as people look at new type schedules, as they look at moving on through the educational process and getting into the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that we have different areas where we need employment and being able to finish a little bit earlier. Not everybody wants to go on a 4- or 5-year program. There are some people that want to go through in a 3-year program, 3 1/2 -year program, and so this addresses a societal change and a need that is there that allows that flexibility that students want. And that is where we need to place the emphasis, allowing people to take control, individuals to take control and make decisions that  are going to suit them and not having the bureaucracy make those for them, which all too often, when we create nine new entitlement programs, with nine new bureaucracies, we don't see fast decision-making on something. We see this go into that black hole or the terminal put on hold that so many of our constituents continue to complain about every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to commend to this body and thank Mr. McKeon for the work that puts the emphasis on our military by providing for them extended deferment options for our returning soldiers who may need extra time to get settled and to return to careers and be able to begin repaying any outstanding student loans. Certainly in my district, the Seventh District of Tennessee, this is something that has been recognized as a need. We have so many that have served so honorably with the 101st  Airborne at Fort Campbell, and this is a provision that is important. It is one that is recognized by us, by the minority, by those of us on this side of the aisle, and it's one that we do express our thanks for being included.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The McKeon amendment, the substitute is the right move. It is the right balance. It puts the funding where it is needed by increasing those Pell Grants, and I do rise in support of it, and I thank the gentleman for his work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Miller for his recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act and want to thank my good friend, the chairman, for his leadership and the members of the committee for their exceptional work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am very supportive of the bill's overall goal, I have a concern that the bill incorporates the Bush administration's proposal to significantly cut the yield on all lenders across the board. Students and parents have saved millions of dollars due to smaller competitive lenders offering consolidation loans at lower interest rates. Greater competition leads to lower prices and more choices for the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to thank the chairman for his recognition of small lenders. And quite honestly, he's worked very, very hard to get the legislation to this point, and I know he continues to try to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman for eliminating the origination fee for small lenders because that's an important part of this bill as well. It will lower interest rates for students in the future. But we must ensure that individuals currently enrolled do not pay more when they're starting to repay their loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with Chairman Miller and the ranking member and hope that this matter will be addressed in conference, and I know the chairman has committed to continue to try to do that. We must ensure that we help all students, parents and lenders equally and fairly.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a member of the committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for giving me time to speak on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the McKeon substitute amendment, and I'm opposed to the underlying bill as it's written. Historically, our Federal Government has limited entitlement spending to programs like Medicare and Social Security, and we're still trying to work out or trying to figure out how to make those programs solvent and sustainable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill creates nine new entitlement programs. And knowing that entitlement programs never die, we need to admit to the taxpayers that if this passes they will be expected to kick in another 15 to $30 billion to cover the cost of these new entitlement programs starting in 2013.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also starts the precedent of creating entitlement programs for institutions and organizations. This act does little to reduce college costs and shortchanges those students who need help the most to pay for college. The bill spends less than one-third of the total savings on investing in low income students struggling to achieve their dreams of a college education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than addressing the needs of our Nation's low income students, this bill spends billions of dollars on providing additional subsidies to institutions of higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to instead support the McKeon amendment, which would increase Pell Grants for our neediest students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment, in addition, makes two significant improvements to the Pell Grant program. It provides funds for year-round Pell Grants to help those students who wish to pursue their education, not only in the fall and spring, but in summer as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, the student aid programs have only addressed the needs of traditional dependent students who attend fall and spring semester and then go home for summer. It's time that we do more to meet the needs of working adults and nontraditional students who need greater flexibility in pursuing their educational goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment reduces interest rates for parents and graduate students in the Pell program who now pay 8.5 percent instead of 7.9 percent, which is paid by their peers in the direct loan program. There's simply no reason at all to charge parents and students different interest rates, and this problem needs to be addressed as soon as possible. I'm disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle did not see the need to help these parents and students who are being unfairly penalized  under current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, this amendment also helps our military, as was mentioned earlier, by providing extended deferment options for our returning soldiers who may need extra time to get settled before repaying any outstanding student loans. This provision was included in the committee mark, and for that I'm grateful, and I think it's certainly a provision I support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, the McKeon amendment addresses a concern that Mr. McKeon has been voicing for the last three or four years, and that concern has to do with rising costs of college. I'm happy to see that this amendment includes the text of Mr. McKeon's bill, <bill type="h" number="472">H.R. 472</bill>, which brings much needed transparency to the college cost issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, rising college costs are a major concern of parents across the country who find it more and more difficult to pay their tuition bills; yet no one can or will explain why costs continue to increase at rates far exceeding the rate of inflation. It's time to arm parents and students with information that can be used to make these wise choices in selecting an institution of higher learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for these reasons, I wholeheartedly support the McKeon amendment as a substitute to this bill, and urge passage of this very important amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment in the nature of a substitute for it undermines and it strikes all of the important initiatives that cause this legislation to be one of the imperative legislative initiatives of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It impacts negatively the middle class. It undermines the qualified teacher provision. It takes away the reward for public service and, of course, it does not deal with the issue of philanthropic participation in college retention and financing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let me tell you what I am supporting. I am supporting the single largest increase in college funding, college aid since the GI Bill. I am supporting the mother who spoke to me on the way up to Washington saying, "I'm a middle class, single parent, working to send my daughter to college, and I just can't do it. Does anybody understand that plea? I just can't do it." This helps this mother send her daughter to college!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what does this aid package do? This incentive package reinvests in America's young people! It reinvests by strengthening the middle class, by making college more affordable. It increases the power of the Pell Grant through scholarship. It insures that we have qualified teachers in every classroom. It is an equal opportunity promoter of education for Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then it does something unique. It does something that is not discriminatory. It reflects on the value of historically black colleges, Hispanic-serving colleges and other colleges that serve underserved populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the real truth of that, representing Texas Southern University when our Governor could find no other way to solve the problem of that college other than to put it into a conservatorship. Isn't it interesting, Mr. Speaker, that if they had put it into a conservatorship, they would have lost all of their accreditation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill invests in helping to retain students. It gives them scholarships. It promotes the colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know if this can be seen, but it is clear when we show this example of what Republicans have done in investing in our college education and what Democrats have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I know that my good friend on the other side of the aisle agrees with me that the education of our children is not a partisan issue. So I would encourage him to, if you will, ignore his motion for a substitute and support the underlying bill because colleges like Texas Southern University, Prairie View A&amp;M and Morgan State and Florida A&amp;M are grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the Education and Labor College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This bill does much more than ease the burden of student loans for college graduates--it will make the American dream possible for low- and middle-income students and families who pay for college. Mr. Speaker, in 21st-century America, a college education is critical for individual success and the strength of our Nation. Higher education is associated with better health, greater wealth,  and more vibrant civic participation, as well national economic competitiveness in today's global environment. As the need for a college degree has grown, however, so has the cost of obtaining that education. The result is rising student debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> would provide about $18 billion in college financial aid at no new cost to taxpayers. This new investment is critical for African-American students and their families, especially given that African-American students comprise about 12 percent of all undergraduate students. Many institutions have helped black students bridge ethnic-related economic barriers, making a college education possible for underprivileged minorities. Among historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs),  which give African American students an opportunity to have an educational experience in a community in which they are a part of the majority, costs are also rising. This resolution would support many of these honorable institutions in their righteous deeds in educating our underprivileged students of color.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> because it will increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $500 and increase eligibility to  serve more students in the program. The Federal Pell Grant Program prides itself on providing need-based grants to low-income undergraduate and certain postbaccalaureate students to promote access to postsecondary education. Forty-five percent of African American and Hispanic students at 4-year colleges depend on Pell Grants, compared to 23 percent of all students. Approximately 4.5 million students currently depend on Pell Grants and "over 70 percent of Pell Grant funds go to students from  families with incomes of $20,000 a year or less". Increasing the maximum Pell Grant Award will expand racial and ethnic diversity in higher education institutions, benefiting not only the institutions cultural background but it will also be a great learning experience for students to learn diverse cultural background different from their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> would cut the interest rates on need-based Federal student loans in half from 6.8 percent to 3-4 percent over 5 years. Once fully implemented, this cut would save the typical borrower--with about $13,800 in need-based loan debt--$4,400 over the life of the loan. About 38 percent of African-American students take out need-based student loans each year. By cutting interest rates on Federal loans, Congress can save college graduates thousands of dollars over the life of their loans. Mr.  Speaker, recent graduates, especially those of minority status with low to moderate incomes, must spend the vast majority of their salaries on necessities such as rent, health care, and food. For borrowers struggling to cover basic costs, student loan repayment can create a significant and measurable impact on their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crushing student debt also has societal consequences, according to a report by two highly respected economists, Drs. Saul Schwarz and Sandy Baum, the prospect of burdensome debt likely deters skilled and dedicated college graduates from entering and staying in important careers educating our Nation's children and helping the country's most vulnerable populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To solve this problem and ensure that higher education remains within reach for all Americans, we need to increase need-based grant aid; make loan repayment fair and affordable; protect borrowers from usurious lending practices; and provide incentives for State governments and colleges to control tuition costs. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> is an important step in a new and right direction for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, the Education and Labor College Cost Reduction Act of 2007.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington, our newest mother in the House of Representatives, Cathy McMorris Rodgers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="RODGERS, McMORRIS" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I rise in opposition to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my opinion, it continues some broken promises to us by the majority party. This bill is not fiscally responsible, and it is not going to increase access to college education in this country. Yes, it proposes to spend more money, nine new entitlement programs, that means nine new categories for mandatory spending, but not in ways that will increase access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I worked my way through college. I was the first in my family to graduate from college, and I am actually still paying some of those student loans from going back to school recently. And I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to go to college and am committed to ensuring that every student in America has access to higher education. It is really part of the American Dream. Unfortunately, this college relief bill does little to actually increase access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican alternative would have roughly doubled the Pell Grant aid proposed in this bill. That is direct help to students when they need it, when they have to pay for tuition at the beginning of each quarter. Reducing interest rates will help graduates with debt relief, but it will not help students that are currently struggling to make tuition. The vast majority of spending in this bill provides token interest rate cuts for college graduates. Only one-third of the new spending goes towards  Pell Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do more to fund new programs like Pell Grants, which actually do increase access and opportunities, and the McKeon substitute would do just that. We also must do more to address rising tuition costs and the impact that is having on students' ability to afford college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tuition rates have risen above costs of inflation. Here is an example from my own State, Washington State: Over the past 10 years, Washington State  University and the University of Washington have both increased tuition and fees by over 80 percent. At the same time, Washington's per capita of personal income has increased at only about 40 percent, and inflation is a little over 20 percent. We must address the root cause of this problem, what is really  driving tuition costs. This bill does nothing to address the skyrocketing cost of tuition, which is disastrous for students and parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats have talked a lot about providing college relief for students; yet, once again, this bill does more to help graduates and institutions rather than helping our current or future college students. Our focus must be on remaining sure that every person who wants to go to college has that opportunity to do so.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am happy to yield such time as he may consume to the ranking member of the Higher Education Subcommittee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to begin by thanking the chairman and also the ranking member for their hard work on this bill. Chairman Miller has accommodated us when he can and opposed us when he must, and I know we have worked together as much as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we owe the public an explanation, before we talk about our differences, of what we have in common. So let me begin with what both sides throughout this debate have in common, essentially three things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we believe that all children, rich or poor, should have the opportunity to go to college. Second, we believe that there should be consequences and sunlight on those colleges who excessively increase tuition. And, third, we believe that Pell Grants are the passport out of poverty for so many worthy young children from low- and moderate-income families, and they deserve to be increased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there are four major differences in this bill, and these differences result in many of us Republicans not being able, regrettably, to vote for this bill. The first difference is on entitlements. How do you feel about new mandatory entitlements? The Democratic bill has nine new entitlement programs with mandatory spending. The Republican substitute has zero new entitlement programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do you feel about Pell Grants, which is money we give to low- and moderate-income families to help their kids go to college? Today the Appropriations Committee is going to be increasing Pell Grants to $4,700. Under the Democrat bill, next year, they will have an additional $100, for a total of $4,800. Under the Republican substitute, students would have an additional $350 for a total of $5,050. So if you care about Pell Grants, you would do substantially better under the Republican bill if  you were a student than you would under the Democrat bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do you feel about paying down the deficit? The Democrats use only $1.5 billion to pay down the deficit. We more than triple that in the Republican bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How do you feel about private sector versus government-run programs? We have a basic, honest philosophical difference in this belief. Republicans believe that competition among the private sector is good for lower prices and lower taxes. Democrats believe, at least some do, that big government-run programs are better, and if that means eventually raising taxes, especially on the wealthy, then so be it. And we see that in the context of the student loan debate here. Republicans aren't afraid to  take money out of the private student lenders. We did so as part of the Deficit Reduction Act. We took $16 billion away from their subsidies. But the Democrat bill, on top of the $16 billion, takes an additional $18.5 billion. It cuts the lender subsidies down to the bone to the point that the private student loan providers really won't be able to make a living if they are the small folks, and it will run many of them out of business. The big folks will stay in business. And that is okay to some on the other side. They prefer the direct student lending program. Under</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are a parent and you want to take out a loan for your child to go to college, under the FFEL program, which is the private program, you have to pay 8.5 percent; under the direct lending program from the government, only 7.9 percent. Again, trying to encourage people to go with the big government program. And that was a drafting error that the Republican Congress made when we were passing the Deficit Reduction Act. And we tried to correct it in this bill. The Democrats knew about it, and  they didn't let us correct it. And I suspect, and this is my feeling, it is because they expressly favor the direct loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have a philosophical difference. I think the motives on both sides are pure. We have an honest difference of opinion with regard to entitlements, Pell grant funding, paying down the debt and private sector involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I will urge my colleagues to vote "yes" in favor of the McKeon substitute and "no" on the underlying bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>How much time do I have remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California has 4 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I again think that this has been an interesting debate today. I thank the chairman for giving us the opportunity to offer our substitute. I know he didn't have to do that, and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss some of the differences and to present an alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years I served as subcommittee chairman on the Higher Education Subcommittee. And during that time, I talked about accessibility, accountability and affordability for higher education. The only opportunity that people have to better their lot in life here in this country is through education. And I have seen studies that show that 40 percent of our young people from lower-income families are not able to go to college. And that is just not acceptable. And I think that with our substitute,  where we put an additional almost $10 billion into Pell Grants, I think that is a tremendous opportunity to help the affordability aspect of college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, through this bill, there is nothing done to lower the cost of tuition, to make the higher education experience more affordable. As I said, the cost of a higher education during the last 20 years has gone up four times faster than the rate of inflation. Mrs. McMorris Rogers mentioned earlier, in her State, the cost of tuition has gone up in the last few years 80 percent while the cost of inflation has gone up 20 percent. Again, that is still four times faster. It has gone up faster  than the cost of health care. And I think that that is a crisis that in some way we need to come together on. State governments, the Federal Government, students, parents, we all need to come together, come to grips with this issue because to prepare a workforce that is going to carry us through this 21st Century and be competitive throughout the world, we are going to have to do something to make it possible for our young people to get a higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think adding new entitlements is the way to do it. I think increasing Pell Grants is very important. And for that reason, I encourage our colleagues to support the amendment, the substitute amendment. If that passes, then support the bill. If it doesn't pass, I encourage them to vote against the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and members of the committee, I think this has been a very good debate because this has been a debate about which direction this country should go in and I believe will go in and the direction that the American people want this country to go in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parents all over this Nation hear every day from business leaders, from educational leaders, from the media, they hear that for America to be competitive, we have got to have a smarter workforce, a better skilled workforce, a better equipped workforce so that we can continue America's leadership in the world in the economics of the world and in the national security of this country. The key to that workforce, the key to that competitiveness, again, the very people who are hiring those individuals  say that you must have a college education. What used to be good enough, which was graduation from high school, is no longer good enough today. You have to have advanced learning. It may be in a professional school. It may be in a trade school. It may be in a community college. It may be in a 4-year college. You may get some of it now and some of it later. But the fact of the matter is, you need those skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what has happened over this time is that college education has increased as rapidly as anything else in society, in fact, more rapidly than many other indicators in our economy, over 35 to 40 percent over the last 5 years above inflation. What has that meant? That meant that families who thought they could afford that education now find that they have to squeeze harder. That meant that people who thought they weren't going to have to borrow money are now going to have to borrow money. That  meant that people who thought they were going to be able to go to college are now deciding that they can no longer go to college. They are going to postpone it or maybe not go at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's not good for America. That's not good for America's economy. That's not good for America's democratic institutions. And it's not good for our society. We need those young people to go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this legislation does today is it says to those individuals who are fully qualified to go to college, we will not deny you access to the college of your choice, to the education of your choice, to the career of your choice, and to the curriculum of your choice because you can't afford to pay for it. We're going to help you. We're not going to give you everything you need. Your family is still going to have to sacrifice, you're still going to have to pay back loans, but we're going to give  you greater access to the ability to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to take this country in a new direction. We're going to take this country in a direction where we place a priority, a focus and a vision for education in America today because we know we must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're told again by the leaders of all of the new technologies, the new companies, the people who are investing in the future that we were the beneficiaries of when John Kennedy said that he wanted to send a person to the Moon and bring them back safely. It was more than a Moon shot. John Kennedy captured our imagination; he captured world leadership with that decision. And over the next decade, we did exactly as he directed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you know what else they did? They give 28,000 high-performing college students a grant to go to graduate school so they didn't have to borrow money, they didn't have to walk around with a tin cup, they didn't have to put themselves into debt, so they could use their best skills and talents to create the space program. You know what they created after they created the space program? They created Intel, they created Microsoft, they created Hewlett Packard. They created the infrastructure of  this Nation. Now, did we whine and moan because they got a grant and the taxpayers used their money? They created millions of jobs in this country over the next four decades. That's what this is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the investments that my grandparents made in my education before they ever met me. Those are the investments that my parents made in my education after they met me. They still thought it was worth something. And those are the investments that have made this country the greatest and strongest Nation in the world, have made us an economic leader, and have given us the ability to lead the world. Do we want to turn our back on it now? If you accept this substitute, you're turning our back  on that idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans say, well, we're just going to take a little less money, but we're going to put it all in the Pell Grant. The Republicans, after flatlining Pell Grant all of these years when they had the opportunity to do something, did nothing. Now they want to love this bill to death by putting all the money in the Pell Grant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what this legislation will do for Pell recipients; it will take them up to $5,200 in a Pell Grant. That may or may not pay for their education for that year, but it's a big leap forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we also recognize something else, that this isn't the only constituency struggling to pay for education in this country. No, there are millions of students who will take out a subsidized student loan. And for those students, and their parents who will help them pay it back if they're that fortunate, for those students they will be paying for it by themselves, we're saying we will cut the interest rate in half when you graduate and you start to repay your loan. You borrow the money today,  you pay your tuition, and when it comes time to pay your loan, your interest rate is half of what it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we know that those middle-income families in this country are struggling as hard as anybody. They have the same vision, the same hope and the same aspiration for their children. So that's why we're doing this, because it's the best investment we can make in this country in that talent of our children, in the brilliance and the excitement and the vision of those children. That's what this legislation is about. But that's not what this substitute legislation is about. You cannot walk away  from them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it interesting that just 4 months ago, 5 months ago, 124 Republicans voted to cut those interest rates for middle-income families and their children, and now they're going to vote against it today. So they voted for it then, and now they're going to vote against it today. What was going on? Did they believe it then, or they don't believe it now? Which is it? But the fact of the matter is, this is about whether or not those families that struggle, they may be single parents, they may be  two in their family, they may be families that find themselves with one, two or three kids in college at the same time. This government should help them because those children will return that gift of this Nation back to this Nation time and time again over the life of their earnings, over their careers. They will give back to this Nation because we made that investment as my parents and grandparents made in us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you vote for this substitute, you get rid of the interest rate cuts for those middle-income families. And also, for these very same Pell recipients, over half of these students will have to borrow money because a Pell Grant isn't enough. So they participate also in that interest rate cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You fail to participate in the loan forgiveness for the teacher, for the firefighter, for the policeman, for the special education teacher, for first responders. For those people in critical occupations that give so much to this society, but they're not the highest paying jobs, we're telling them if you stay on the job 5 years, we will give you $5,000 in loan forgiveness. For a student that graduates with an average debt of around $13,000, $14,000, that's a significant amount of loan forgiveness.  What do we get? We get an educated firefighter, an educated policeman, a school teacher. We get these people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For high-performing college students who are willing to go into teaching and go into math, science and engineering, and then go to the most difficult schools to teach, we're saying we will give you $4,000 a year in tuition assistance while you're in school, not later,  up to $16,000; again, an investment, because we now know that a highly qualified teacher can dramatically change the educational outcomes and the future for the children in ways that we  can only dream about. That's an important investment, because that investment in that teacher will be invested in all of those students that come across his or her line of vision in those classes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why this legislation is about a vision for America. That's why this legislation goes in a different direction. We stop today when we flatline aid to education in this country. We want to invest in young people. We want their families to be able to invest with us. And that's the importance of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, clearly, the commitment that we make to minority-serving institutions so that those students who are fully qualified to go to school go to school, receive the kind of help to keep them in school so they don't end up dropping out with a debt on the loans that they took. We want that success. It's a problem that's recognized across the country; we address it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We raise the cap on the amount of money that families can borrow. It's not great news to hear we let you borrow more, but it's a lot cheaper than if you have to borrow it in the private loan market. It's 3.8 percent here, and it's 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent in the private market. That means a lot to families. That means a lot to students. That's what this legislation is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this substitute, to vote for the passage of the final bill. Let's take America to a new future. Let's take America to new heights. Let's take America to new greatness on the next generation of discoverers, of innovators, and of economic creators.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am, in its current form.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.</chair>
  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative> Mr. Roskam moves to recommit the bill <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill> to the Committee on Education and  Labor with instructions to report the same back to the House promptly with an amendment providing that a borrower who is a full-time elected public official who receives compensation for such elected position, or who is a registered lobbyist at either the Federal or State level who receives compensation for lobbying activities, shall be ineligible for any of the loan forgiveness  programs included in the bill.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam) is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412202" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit with instructions, and it surrounds the general topic of student loan forgiveness. As we know, student loan forgiveness programs seek to help students with the cost of college or encourage them to enter a particular occupation or field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was first put in place back in 1958 in the National Defense Education Act, and it was reenacted and made part of the Perkins loan program, and it provides forgiveness largely for borrowers who are employed in a specific public service job, including teachers, but over the years has added others as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to read a short list of those who are currently eligible under various programs for student loan forgiveness. They include: Public school teachers; Head Start staff, whether teachers or not; special education teachers; military members in combat areas; volunteers in the Peace Corps; law enforcement officers; correction officers; teachers in specific areas who are teaching in math, science, foreign language or bilingual education; nurses; medical technicians; child care providers;  family service agency workers; researchers at NIH; health professionals in the National Health Service Corps; AmeriCorp volunteers; National Civilian Corps volunteers; and VISTA volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These loan forgiveness programs are so popular, in fact, that 43 States currently have them. Congressional Research Service not long ago surveyed a whole host of financial aid officials across the country and came to the conclusion that these are very effective programs in meeting students' financial needs and particular workforce needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, the House took on the challenge to expand loan forgiveness for prosecutors and public defenders, and clearly there is a good public purpose behind that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But now under the bill, Mr. Speaker, basically anyone who works for the government or a nonprofit organization would be eligible for loan forgiveness. I repeat that. Basically anyone who works for the government or a nonprofit organization would be eligible for loan forgiveness. So what does that mean? Does that mean that Members of Congress would be eligible for loan forgiveness? I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but nobody sent me here to expand loan forgiveness eligibility for Members of  Congress. And, in fact, Members of Congress are eligible under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are members of State legislatures eligible for loan forgiveness under this bill? Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Are registered lobbyists who work for nonprofit organizations, are they eligible? Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like us to look at some of the CEOs of nonprofit organizations and reflect on their compensation and how that would play into this eligibility question. According to the Charity Navigator, the former head of Planned Parenthood Federation of America made over half a million dollars, $500,000, and would that person be eligible? Yes, as would John Adams, the president of the Natural Resources Defense Counsel who makes almost $300,000 a year. The National Journal reported in  2004 that the median compensation for think tanks was $264,000 a year. Or how about this, $227,000 for education, government and welfare organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does anybody really believe that these individuals need this kind of support from the taxpayers? My point is that this new blanket program for nonprofit organizations will give a number of well-to-do individuals a government handout that they don't need and our constituents should not have to fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the real question is whether this is the highest and best use of taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I would submit that it is not, so this motion to recommit is very simple. It would prohibit a borrower who is an elected full-time public official and is paid for that position, as well as a paid registered lobbyist at either the State or Federal level, from receiving any of the loan forgiveness available under this act, period. Very simple, very clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we should speak clearly to the American taxpayers that we as elected officials are not trying to create some unfair advantage for ourselves, that we are not trying to reward ourselves, or our elected colleagues, nor any registered lobbyist, by giving away their hard-earned taxpayer dollars to pay off student debts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment or to at least set some parameters of this big government program under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit says this will not allow a public officeholder or a lobbyist to get loan forgiveness. This has never been raised, and if you don't want them to get it, write me a letter and we will take care of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what this does is this says that you must report this back promptly, so this kills this bill. This kills this bill. The greatest contribution to helping families pay for education since the GI bill, they want to kill it. Cutting interest rates in half for middle-income families, they want to kill it. You could have written the motion another way. You deliberately wrote it this way so you could kill this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is it you don't like about this bill? You don't like the fact that while you were in power, after years of flatlining the Pell Grant, we finally have given the biggest increase in decades for the poorest kids in the country. You don't like that, so you want to kill the bill. You don't like the fact that we are going to take 5 million middle-class kids and extend to them a loan with an interest rate that is cut in half while their families are struggling to get them through college. They  are making sacrifices every year. You are going to do this. You are going to kill this bill? Are you proud of this amendment that you are going to try to kill this bill? Say it louder, that you are proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about loan forgiveness? This amendment supposedly is about loan forgiveness, but in the process, they kill loan forgiveness to firefighters and policemen and nurses and teachers of special education and people who hold our society together and make it work, they kill that. What is it they don't like about having a society that can help its children? What is it they don't like about partnering up with families who want to help pay their kids' education, that borrow money, that are told every  day they have to save more for this education, and here we are giving them loan forgiveness. We are giving them loan forgiveness because they have chosen to go into a career that doesn't pay very well. We are giving them an interest rate cut that will save them $4,000. That loan forgiveness will save them $5,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are raising the amount of money that they can borrow, no great gift to their parents, money that they can borrow, but they don't have to go to the private market and pay 15 percent. They can pay 3.8 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That's what this legislation is about. What is it you don't understand about the American people's vision? Mr. Speaker, what is it they don't understand about the American people's vision for this country? What is it you don't understand that America wants to go in a new direction? What is it you don't understand about this vision of the future where we have faith in our children, where they have the confidence of their parents; they have the vision that their kids can succeed, that they can  be the next generation of discoverers, of innovators, of those who create economic opportunities and hire other people or get hired?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the vision America wants, and it needs help to pay for that education, and this is what this legislation does. That's what this legislation does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we help those minority-serving institutions. I guess you don't like that either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yes, we thought we would partner up with some of the richest people in the world who said that if you partner up, we think we can raise hundreds of millions of dollars for poor children. So we said, you raise $1, we'll match it with 50 cents. They're now telling us they think they can raise hundreds of millions of dollars of private money. Sounds kind of Republican to me, but what the hell, I don't know.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>We've even got a multiplier in this bill. We tell high-achieving college students who are studying math, science and engineering, if you will commit to going in and teaching in the most difficult schools in this Nation, you will bring those talents to those kids, we'll give you $4,000 tuition relief while you're in school, not later. We know that that is a multiplier because we know the kids that are exposed to highly qualified and effective teachers can learn  things that we can't believe of, and that's what gives back to this society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the day, maybe Speaker Pelosi said it best: The dollars we invest in this legislation, the dollars we invest in these young people, that we invest in their families, in their futures, in their competencies, comes back to us every year from the same group of people as they graduate. They return the gifts. They return this gift of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're trying to do for this next generation, what my grandparents did for me, what my parents did for me. And those investments that they made in the college systems of this country, in the GI bill in this country, what did they do? They took America to the premier position in the world in economic leadership, in national security, in foreign affairs, took us to the first place in the world and has been there for 50 years based upon that investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America knows now that they need a new investment, and that's what this legislation is about. It's about a new investment for the next generation, the next generation of talent and competency and fearless and beautiful young people, beautiful young people who want their future to be as rewarding as all of ours have been. I ask you to vote "no" on this amendment.</paragraph>
