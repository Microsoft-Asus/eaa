    <paragraph>Madam President, today I rise to honor the achievements of Peter Chase Neumann. Not only is Peter recognized locally and nationally for his skill as a trial lawyer, he is also deeply involved with philanthropies whose work has been enormously beneficial to Nevada. These significant contributions have resulted in Peter being named the recipient of the Nevada Trial Lawyers Association Lifetime Achievement Award, and deservedly so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter has tried more than 150 civil and criminal cases to verdict and almost 50 appeals to the Nevada and Arizona Supreme Courts. His ability in the legal profession is renowned, and his talents are wide-ranging, from trial advocacy in personal injury cases to writing academic articles. He has dedicated himself to the cause of justice for the wrongfully injured, and has been recognized for his work in Town and Country Magazine's Top Trial Lawyers in America, in Las Vegas Magazine, by Top Gun  Lawyers in Nevada and by The Best Lawyers in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His leadership in the legal community is unparalleled: He has served as president of the Arizona, Nevada, and Western Trial Lawyers Association, and on the Board of Governors for the American Trial Lawyers Association. He was both legislative advocate for and president of the Plaintiff's Bar, and was accepted as a diplomat in the International Society of Barristers and the American Board of Trial Advocates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His devotion to the law has not in any way impeded his philanthropic contributions. He and his wife Renate have served with the Angel Kiss Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to helping families cope with the financial burdens associated with childhood cancer. President Clinton recognized Peter's influence and appointed him to the Tahoe Regional Planning Committee. He has involved himself with Scenic America and Scenic Nevada, committing himself to the cause of protecting Nevada's natural treasures  in the Lake Tahoe region and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter is also an accomplished airplane pilot. In recent years, he has spent untold hours soaring in his gliders all over America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most people know Peter for his reputation as a renowned trial lawyer or for his work in the philanthropic community in my State. But I have had the privilege to call Peter my friend. It is my great pleasure to offer congratulations to Peter Chase Neumann for his lifetime of excellence in his profession, in his public service, and in his philanthropy.</paragraph>
