    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize Kelly's Closet of Waterford, ME, a woman-owned small business that has helped reinvent a traditional product in a new and environmentally friendly way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Kelly Wells founded Kelly's Closet in 2001, there were few options for parents looking for cost-effective, sanitary, and environmentally friendly diapers for their children. Like any good enterprising businesswoman, Ms. Wells identified this underserved market and then moved to supply the demand. At first, Ms. Wells's venture failed to attract the customers for which she had hoped and no orders arrived for 4 months. Despite these early difficulties, Ms. Wells persevered, and eventually her  tenacity paid off. The orders that had started off slow rose exponentially, and her business had grown to such an extent that the most significant problem she and her two employees now face is keeping the "shelves" of their virtual store stocked with the company's products. Today, Kelly's Closet combines the Internet's tremendous marketing platform with good old-fashioned Maine friendliness to create a customer experience second to none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kelly's Closet offers many different diaper and diaper liner options in a wide variety of fibers, from flannel, fleece, and organic cotton, to more unique choices like rice paper and bamboo. Ms. Wells's notably wide variety of merchandise is easy to identify with catchy names like "Rumpsters," "Knickernappies," and "Tiny Tush." Kelly's Closet also sells additional products from other trusted and well-known companies, including accessories for strollers, diaper bags, and other children's  apparel, such as swim diapers for the summer and baby boots and shoes for any time of year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to a varied selection, Kelly's Closet also helps to educate parents about cloth diapers. For parents, making the right diaper choice can sometimes be a confusing process. To help these parents, Ms. Wells publishes a newsletter and has a special easy-to-use section on her Web site that is dedicated to answering parents' frequently asked questions about diaper fabrics, size, and care, as well as the history of the cloth diaper movement. These additions to her Web site ensure that consumers  are well informed before they make their first purchase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maine is a State known for its innovators and entrepreneurs, and Kelly Wells is a member of that proud group. Her perseverance, tenacity, and business acumen are a testament to what a small business can accomplish. In 8 years, Ms. Wells has helped transform the way parents purchase diapers and has expanded their possibilities to a great degree. I wish Kelly Wells and all the employees of Kelly's Closet continued success as they grow, innovate, and expand their business.</paragraph>
