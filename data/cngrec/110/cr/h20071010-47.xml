    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Members of the House that are still here this afternoon, and people of America, I ask you to join with me in a moment to say prayers for the families of the victims from the Cleveland shooting this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate that we as a Nation once again face a shooting in a public schoolhouse. It is unfortunate that we once again face children who have access to guns in an educational environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask you to pray for the family of the young man who was the shooter. I ask you to pray for the families of the persons who were injured in this shooting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Day after day we will get all kinds of questions about what happened and how it happened and what we could have done. But today is a day when we should stop and just for a moment say prayers on behalf of all those families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Cleveland is my home. I grew up there. I currently represent it, and I ask you to hold us in your thoughts and prayers and pray that God will give us the strength and the ability to work through this difficult time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
