  <narrative>URGING SUPPORT FOR <bill type="h" number="4102">H.R. 4102</bill>, STOP OUTSOURCING SECURITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13867]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Today the New York Times reports that at least 14 of the 17 shootings from the September 16 Blackwater incident in Iraq were unjustified and violated deadly force rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though the FBI concluded that Blackwater, a for-profit contractor, used excessive force, there is no guarantee that anyone will be punished for these killings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the front page of the New York Times ran a story titled "Security Guard Fires From Convoy, Killing Iraqi Driver." The shooter was an employee of DynCorp, and the victim an Iraqi taxi driver. The details of the incident are still unclear, but one thing is certain. The problem of trigger-happy contractors isn't confined to one company; it applies to all private security contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The longer we wait to fix this problem, the worse the situation is going to get for the Iraqis and for our troops. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Stop Outsourcing Security Act, <bill type="h" number="4102">H.R. 4102</bill>, to phase out unaccountable private security contractors before they do any more damage.</paragraph>
