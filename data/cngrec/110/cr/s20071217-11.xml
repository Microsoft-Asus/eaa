  <narrative>FHA MODERNIZATION ACT -- (Senate - December 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15768">S15768</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to support the FHA Modernization Act of 2007, and I hope the House and Senate can quickly work together to get this legislation to the President. This bill is a good first step to helping address both housing affordability issues and problems in the subprime lending industry. I look forward to monitoring the legislation's implementation to ensure that the FHA reforms truly benefit low-income and middle-income homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rising rate of foreclosures and its broader impact on the nation's economy is a serious issue that requires the involvement of all levels of government as well as both private and non-profit organizations. Subprime lending and rising foreclosure rates are complicated issues to unravel and any response, whether legislative or regulatory, will bring with it a set of consequences, some intended and some unintended. We need to examine a variety of responses to the rising foreclosure rates and  their consequences, including providing more housing counseling for borrowers and more effectively regulating lending practices to prevent some of the unscrupulous practices that have occurred. Some of the more egregious lending practices include high rates of predatory lending in minority communities, steering borrowers into subprime mortgage products even if the borrowers qualified for more conventional loans, and not ensuring that borrowers fully understood the terms of subprime loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was disappointed that the Senate FHA Modernization Act did not contain a provision directing some of the revenue realized by the FHA bill into an affordable housing fund as the House FHA reform bill did. I hope that conferees will work hard to find a fiscally responsible way to direct some of the increased revenue from the FHA bill into a national affordable housing trust fund. I also hope that Congress can pass stand-alone legislation creating a national affordable housing trust fund in the  coming year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The creation of more affordable housing through a national affordable housing trust fund will also help to alleviate the affordable housing crisis we are facing throughout the country. Local communities around the country are creating such trust funds, including in my state of Wisconsin. Congress needs to act promptly so that a national affordable housing trust fund can complement the good work going on in states and local communities throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I introduced legislation, the Affordable Housing Expansion and Public Safety Act, which contained provisions designed to assist low-income Americans in affording safe and adequate housing, including authorizing 100,000 new Section 8 vouchers, authorizing new targeted funding for the HOME program, reauthorizing the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug Elimination Program, and calling on Congress to create a national affordable housing trust fund. I hope that Congress can  take a step toward the creation of such a fund by including a provision in the FHA reform bill conference report to dedicate a fiscally responsible revenue stream toward such a national affordable housing trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Nation faces a severe shortage of affordable housing for our most vulnerable citizens. Shelter is one of our most basic needs, and, unfortunately, too many Wisconsinites and people around the country are struggling to afford a place to live for themselves and their families. As Congress continues to take steps to deal with affordability issues, rising foreclosure rates, and reform of lending practices by banks and mortgage brokers, we need to ensure that any such reforms benefit those Americans  most in need.</paragraph>
