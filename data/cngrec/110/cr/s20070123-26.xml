    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the life and legacy of Ms. Jane Bolin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jane Matilda Bolin of Queens, NY, passed away on Monday, January 8, 2007 after a lifetime of public service. In 1939, Ms. Bolin was the first Black woman to become a judge in the United States, and she continued to serve honorably on the bench for the next 40 years. Her lifelong dedication to social justice, civil rights, and to the betterment of our American society serves as an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A trailblazer in so many arenas, Ms. Bolin pursued her goals in the face of widespread discrimination and prejudice. She was the first Black woman to graduate from Yale Law School, the first to join the New York City Bar Association, and the first to work in the city's legal department. In addition to being a fellow Yale Law graduate, she and I also share the same undergraduate alma mater. Ms. Bolin attended Wellesley College in the 1920s as one of only two Black freshmen. She went on to graduate  as a Wellesley Scholar, an honor given only to the top 20 students in her class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Bolin's tenacity set a powerful example for the women of my generation. In 1958, she commented on the struggle for women's rights that "we have to fight every inch of the way and in the face of sometimes insufferable humiliations." And Ms. Bolin never stopped fighting. She spoke out against segregation in her native Pougkheepsie. She used her position on the bench to end the assignment of probation officers and the placement of children in childcare agencies on the basis of race. As a family  court judge, she heard cases ranging from homicides and battered spouses to child support and paternity suits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jane Bolin was truly a remarkable woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my deepest sympathies to her son, Yorke B. Mizzle, and to all those whose lives she enriched. My thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time.</paragraph>
