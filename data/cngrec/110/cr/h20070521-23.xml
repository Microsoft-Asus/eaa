    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the National Football League, the American sports community and the business leadership in Western Missouri lost a true treasure on December 13, 2006, when the Kansas City Chiefs founder, Lamar Hunt, peacefully passed away at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, at the age of 74.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this great American is survived by his wife, Norma, and their four children, some of whom are here with us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lamar Hunt is recognized as one of the greatest sportsmen in American history. He served as the guiding force behind the formation of both the American Football League and the Kansas City Chiefs franchise. Hunt served as a positive influence on the game of football for 47 years, dating back to his conception of the American Football League in 1959.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was the first AFL figure to be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This was a remarkable feat, if you consider that he had become involved in the game just 13 years earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was Lamar Hunt who served as the catalyst, who brought together a group of people whimsically known as the "Foolish Club." He was able to convince eight men to put money up to start a football league that no one thought could survive. This was truly an impossible dream. But the fledgling league took foot on the field for the 1960 season; and on June 8, 1966, the AFL-NFL merger was announced by the NFL Commissioner, Pete Rozelle. On January 15, Lamar Hunt's Kansas City Chiefs were participating  in the first Super Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is worth noting that when the owners met after the merger and began to discuss this football game that would be the bowl game of bowl games, far more noteworthy than the Rose Bowl or the Cotton Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, it was Lamar Hunt who said the bowl game of bowl games should be called the Super Bowl, and thus was born what is now one of the most watched events on this planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before there was a player, coach or general manager in the league, there was Lamar Hunt. There was the late Patriots' owner William Sullivan who remarked at Hunt's Hall of Fame induction ceremony that "Hunt was the cornerstone, the integrity, of the league. Without him, there would have been no AFL."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to serve as Mayor of Kansas City for 8 years. But even before that, during my time on the City Council, I had the great pleasure of meeting and working with Lamar Hunt. Over the years, I can tell you that I have met many, many men and women, some heads of state. I have met kings and one queen. I have never met a person on this Earth yet who had the humility of Lamar Hunt. I have never seen a man who did so much, who accomplished great things at the level of  Lamar Hunt, who could walk around this Capitol and no one would know him because he would be opening doors for everyone and trying to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the tradition of my religion, humility is held perhaps higher than any other characteristic. In fact, in my tradition, the great prophets all praised people with humility, and the pharisees, who did not have humility, who praised themselves, were denounced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lamar Hunt was an innovator. For years and years he advocated the two-point conversion in the NFL. Finally, in 1994, the owners bought into the concept, which is why today there is a two-point conversion. This man would create things in his mind, and he had the ability to share those things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I attribute, as well as many other African Americans, Lamar Hunt with the credit for African Americans moving into all realms of pro football. Before the AFL, there were only a few African Americans playing in the NFL. For a lot of the young people who watch TV today, they would probably find that somewhat amusing. But it was quite possible in the 1950s and even the early 1960s to watch an NFL game and see maybe one or two and, in some instances, maybe no African Americans at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when Lamar Hunt started the AFL, he went to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and began to create players. And what a crop of players he brought in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Willie Lanier, middle linebacker. In those days, and young people will probably find this amazing, people in sports would say African Americans can't play middle linebacker. That is the quarterback of defense. They can't play quarterback. Willie Lanier, who is in the building at this time, Mr. Speaker, became a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was the starting middle linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs for 11 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there was Buck Buchanan at a little school that most people had never even heard of, a black college called Grambling. Buck Buchanan, Pro Football Hall of Fame. Otis Taylor. And the list goes on and on. And when you look at all of the other teams in the AFL, they, too, would go into these schools. So in addition to being an innovator, he was a great humanitarian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt was not able to ever see his long-held dream of hosting a Super Bowl in Kansas City. It was something that he worked on. But, before he died, the NFL owners passed a proposal to bring the NFL's championship game to Kansas City in February of the year 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hunt was a great man, a great leader. He did a lot for our community. I had the pleasure of traveling with him around the world. I had the chance to see him in many, many situations; and I can tell you, this was a giant, even though he never tried to project himself as a giant in any situation, he tried to just blend in. But there is no way the history of the National Football League can be complete without a major section entitled "Lamar Hunt."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members to join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="53">H. Res. 53</bill>, which is to honor the life and legacy and accomplishments of Lamar Hunt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Football League, the American sports community, and the Business Community of Kansas City lost a true treasure on December 13, 2006 when Chiefs Founder Lamar Hunt peacefully passed away at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas at the age of 74.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is survived by his wife, Norma and their four children, Lamar, Jr., Sharron Munson, Clark and Daniel. He was also the proud grandfather of 14 grandchildren. Recognized as one of the greatest sportsmen in American history, Hunt served as the guiding force behind the formation of both the American Football League and the Kansas City Chiefs franchise. Hunt served as a positive influence on the game for 47 years dating back to his conception of the American Football League in '59. He was the first  AFL figure to be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in '72, a remarkable feat considering he became involved in the game just 13 years earlier. Hunt served as the catalyst, who brought together the whimsically-named "Foolish Club" comprised of the eight original AFL owners. His</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Before there was a player, coach or a general manager in the league there was Lamar Hunt," late Patriots owner William Sullivan remarked at Hunt's Hall of Fame induction ceremony. "Hunt was the cornerstone, the integrity of the league. Without him, there would have been no AFL." Despite his many accomplishments, Hunt's humility was one of his most unwavering and most endearing traits. While he modestly declined to take credit for his efforts, he truly played an important role in the design,  ongoing development and direction of the modern-day National Football League. Whether it was serving as the driving force behind the formation of the AFL, serving as a key player in the AFL-NFL merger talks in the '60s, or overseeing many crucial issues concerning pro football and the Chiefs franchise during the past 4 decades, few individuals helped change the face of America's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, he was a persistent advocate of the 2-point conversion option for pro football--an old college and AFL rule that was finally adopted by the NFL in '94. Hunt had also lobbied for many years that an additional Thanksgiving game be added to the NFL schedule and in 2006, those efforts were rewarded when the Chiefs hosted the first-ever Thanksgiving contest at Arrowhead Stadium. Perhaps Hunt's biggest influence on the league over the years was his quiet, yet persuasive voice of reason.  Hunt's name is rightfully mentioned alongside other legendary family surnames in pro football history such as Halas, Mara and Rooney for his commitment to putting the betterment of the league ahead of any potential individual gain. As the founder of the AFL, he helped pave the way for much of the modem growth of pro football. Possibly the greatest tribute to his contributions to the sport was the naming by the league of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After three years in Dallas, Hunt moved his team to Kansas City in '63, where the organization was renamed the Chiefs. Hunt truly helped put Kansas City on the "big-league" map, thanks to a star-studded football team that was the winningest in the 10-year history of the American Football League. Hunt's team repeated as AFL champions in both 1966 and 1969. By winning the 1966 AFL title, the Chiefs earned the right to play in the first Super Bowl against the NFL Champion Green Bay Packers. Three  years later, the Chiefs claimed Kansas City's first major sports championship by defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV. In the late 1960s, Hunt</paragraph>
    <paragraph>was closely involved in the original development plans for Arrowhead Stadium, a facility which provided the Chiefs and their fans with one of the most decided home-field advantages in all of sports. While other venues of a similar vintage have long since been termed obsolete or have been demolished, Arrowhead continues to serve as a point of pride for the Chiefs and the Kansas City community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks in large part to the vision and lobbying efforts of Hunt, Jackson County Missouri voters approved a 3/8 cent sales tax in April of 2006. That measure is expected to raise $425 million for the Truman Sports Complex, of which $325 million has been earmarked to renovate Arrowhead in order to bring the facility up to today's state-of-the-art standards. Those improvements should only further solidify Arrowhead's status as one of America's foremost sporting venues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt's longtime dream of hosting a Super Bowl in Kansas City appeared to become a reality when NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced on November 16, 2005 that NFL owners had passed a proposal to bring the NFL's championship game to Kansas City in February of 2015.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, a provision in April's election that would have resurrected the "rolling roof" concept for Arrowhead Stadium did not pass. The "rolling roof" was part of Hunt's initial vision for Arrowhead Stadium in the '60s. In its  21st century incarnation, the "rolling roof" would have provided a climate-controlled facility suitable for hosting the Super Bowl, the Final Four and other prestigious events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Hunt did not realize his goal of seeing an NFL title game played in Kansas City, he worked diligently to bring other prominent sporting contests to Arrowhead over the years. The "Home of the Chiefs" served as host of the Dr Pepper Big 12 Conference Championship Game in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2006. In addition to numerous other collegiate football contests, the Chiefs hosted several international soccer matches at Arrowhead thanks to Hunt's influence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt's decision to hire Chiefs President, General Manager and CEO Carl Peterson in December '88 set the stage for a football renaissance in Kansas City. During the decade of the '90s, Hunt and Peterson, earned the distinction of becoming just the fourth Owner/General Manager combination to preside over a franchise for all 10 years of a 100-win decade as Kansas City compiled a stellar 102-58 (.638) regular season record from '90-99. Under Hunt's stewardship, the Chiefs developed an intensely-loyal  fan following, not just in Mid-America, but across the country and around the globe. Hunt took great satisfication in the fact that the Chiefs boasted season-ticket holders from 48 of the 50 states (all but Maine and Vermont), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada. He was also appreciative of the fact that Kansas City was selected to represent the NFL in 4 American Bowl contests--Berlin, Germany ('90), Tokyo, Japan ('94, '98) and Monterrey, Mexico ('96).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Chiefs always remained Hunt's most prized sporting entity, his passion for athletics encompassed more than just the game of football. Appropriately nicknamed "Games" during his childhood, Hunt's love of sports was his true lifeblood, an enthusiasm which led to his involvement in 6 different professional sports leagues and 7 sports franchises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his formative role in the creation of the American Football League, Hunt was involved in the development of both the North American Soccer League and a tennis promotion company, World Championship Tennis. Hunt's involvement in those ventures resulted years later in his induction into the respective Halls of Fame of both United States Soccer (located in Oneonta, New York) in '82 and International Tennis (located in Newport, Rhode Island) in '93. He was also inducted into the state  Sports Halls of Fame of both Missouri ('95) and Texas ('84). In total, Hunt was selected to 8 "Halls of Fame," including the Texas Business Hall of Fame ('97) and the Kansas City Business Hall of Fame (2004). In '81, Hunt was inducted into the NFL Alumni Association's prestigious Order of the Leather Helmet and in February of '93, he received the Francis J. "Reds" Bagnell Award from the Maxwell Football Club of Philadelphia for continuing positive contributions to the game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Truly a sportsman for all seasons, Soccer America Magazine named Hunt one of its "25 Most Influential People" in '99 after the 91-year-old U.S. Open Cup was renamed the "Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup." That same year he also received the U.S. Soccer Federation Hall of Fame Medal of Honor, joining former U.S. Soccer President Alan Rothenberg as the only other individual to earn that prestigious distinction. In 2005, the U.S. Soccer Foundation honored Hunt with its Lifetime Achievement Award. The  Hunt Family served as the Investor/Operators of the Kansas City Wizards franchise of Major League Soccer from '95-06 and reveled as the Wizards</paragraph>
    <paragraph>claimed the 2000 MLS Cup. The Hunt Family still oversees the operations of 2 MLS franchises, F.C. Dallas and the Columbus Crew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Hunt Sports Group has been at the forefront of stadium development in the United States, beginning with America's first soccer-specific stadium, 22,555-seat Crew Stadium which opened in '99. In 2005, Pizza Hut Park was completed in Frisco, Texas, giving the Dallas area one of the world's most unique and futuristic soccer facilities. Hunt was also one of the founding investors in the 6-time World Champion Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association. In total, Hunt was the owner of  13 distinctive championship rings from 5 different professional sports associations (AFL/NFL, MLS, NBA, NASL and the U.S. Soccer "Open Cup"). His football championship litany included a Super Bowl IV ring from the '69 Chiefs, as well as AFL title rings from the '62 Texans and '66 Chiefs. A highly-successful businessman outside of sports, one of Hunt's most notable innovations was Sub-Tropolis, the world's largest underground business complex, located just north of Arrowhead Stadium. This naturally climate-controlled,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt was born on August 2, 1932 in El Dorado, Arkansas and graduated from SMU with a B.S. in Geology in '56. While at SMU, he was a 3-year reserve end on the Varsity Football Team. Hunt was an avid supporter of his alma mater and was an annual fixture at the Cotton Bowl. He and his wife Norma were also involved in numerous philanthropic and civic efforts in Dallas, across the state of Texas and in the Kansas City community.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the world of professional sports lost one of its strongest enthusiasts this past December when Lamar Hunt lost his long battle with prostate cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Widely known throughout the professional sports industry, his inspirational career helped the National Football League, the Major Soccer League and the National Hockey League become the massive successes they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, and raised in Dallas, Texas, Lamar Hunt was a passionate sports fanatic. He played on his college football team at Southern Methodist University, but his real involvement began when he applied for an expansion to the National Football League in 1959. He was turned down, and a year later he decided with a group of eight others to form the American Football League. Facing tough competition from the NFL, he was determined to become the owner of a Texas football team.  His first team ownership came with the founding of the Dallas Texans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years later, the team moved to Kansas City and became the Kansas City Chiefs, which Hunt would continue to own until the time of his death. His Chiefs went on to play in the first-ever Super Bowl game, which, by the way, was the term he coined as the championship game between the two leagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lamar Hunt was instrumental in the merger between the National Football League and the American football League in 1970. Beyond football, he made similar efforts in the fields of soccer, tennis and hockey. He helped establish the World Championship Tennis Circuit, Major League Soccer, and its predecessor, the North American Soccer League. At the time of his death, he owned two MLS teams, the FC Dallas and the Columbus Crew. He even furthered his ownership enterprise as one of the original owners  of the Chicago Bulls NBA team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among his numerous awards and honors, he has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the National Soccer Hall of Fame and the International Tennis Hall of Fame. The American Football League trophy presented each year to the AFL champion team is aptly named the Lamar Hunt Trophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is only right that we honor Lamar Hunt for his innovation, dedication and enthusiasm to the national sports industry. His achievements in sports and charitable contributions, as well as his work in theme parks and industrial parks, are to be commended. He was an inspiration to those in the NFL, and his legacy will continue through his teams.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="53">H. Res. 53</bill>, which honors the life of Lamar Hunt and his outstanding contributions to the Kansas City Chiefs, the National Football League and the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="53">H. Res. 53</bill>, which has 52 cosponsors, was introduced by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) on January 11, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="53">H. Res. 53</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as already has been indicated, America lost a great sportsman and businessman when the Kansas City Chiefs football team owner, Mr. Lamar Hunt, passed away on December 13, 2006, at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, at the age of 74.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. William Sullivan, the late Patriots football team owner, said, "Before there was a player, coach or a general manager in the league, there was Lamar Hunt. Hunt was the cornerstone, the integrity of the league. Without him, there would have been no American Football League."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1950s, Mr. Hunt on several occasions approached the National Football League to buy a franchise for his hometown of Dallas, Texas, but he was repeatedly denied. Frustrated by this, he decided to organize a rival pro football circuit, the American Football League, in 1960. Mr. Hunt was the owner of the Dallas Texans, one of the eight original teams that formed the AFL. Mr. Hunt's Dallas Texans won the championship in 1962. Soon after, he moved the team to Kansas City in 1963. He renamed  them the Kansas City Chiefs. The team won the AFL championship in 1966, and the Super Bowl IV title in 1969.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend my colleague Mr. Cleaver not only for introduction of this legislation, but his passionate indication of what the life of Lamar Hunt was, for his personal experiences and contributions not only to the game of football, but to the game of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listening to Representative Cleaver it becomes clear that not only was Mr. Hunt a giant of a football man, but he was a giant of a humanitarian, a giant of a man who could take ideas and convey those in such a way that others would buy into them, while at the same time continuing to live out the thoughts that Kipling had: If you can talk with kings and queens and not lose the common touch; if all men count with you, but none too much; and if you can fill the unforgiving moment with 60  seconds' worth of distance run, yours will be the world and all that is in it. And what is more, you will be a man, my son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lamar Hunt was indeed a giant of a man. I urge passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400158" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of one of Kansas City's legendary figures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lamar Hunt made a positive and lasting impression on Kansas City. He was a man who seemingly touched every life that crossed his path. He was known for his easy-going, engaging personality. He will be remembered not only for what he accomplished, but for the way he treated people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hunt was an innovator. He is credited with making the National Football League what it is today. He coined the term "Super Bowl", championed the 2-point conversion and brought American soccer into the mainstream. He was inducted into 3 different professional sports halls of Fame--football, tennis and soccer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His beloved Kansas City Chiefs played in the American Football League and won the Super Bowl in 1969. The Chiefs are as much a part of Kansas City as barbeque and jazz, thanks to Mr. Hunt's leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hunt though was an innovator in other ways too. He built both Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun as state of the art theme parks in Kansas City. He also built the Subtropolis Office Complex in the limestone caves around Kansas City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, simply stated, Lamar Hunt was a giant among men.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="53">H. Res. 53</bill>, to recognize the life of Lamar Hunt and his outstanding contributions to the Kansas City Chiefs, the National Football League, and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Football League and the American sports community lost a true treasure on December 13, 2006 when Chiefs Founder Lamar Hunt passed away in Dallas, Texas at the age of 74. Lamar Hunt was an independent thinker, a trailblazer who refused to be denied his dream. Recognized as one of the greatest sportsmen in American history, Hunt served as the guiding force behind the formation of both the American Football League and the Kansas City Chiefs franchise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt served as a positive influence on the game for 47 years dating back to his conception of the American Football League in 1959. He was the first AFL figure to be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972, a remarkable feat considering he became involved in the game just 13 years earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt served as the catalyst who brought together the "Foolish Club" comprised of the 8 original AFL owners. His "impossible dream" became a reality when his fledgling league took foot on the field for the 1960 season. On June 8, 1966, the AFL-NFL merger was announced by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and on January 15, 1967, Hunt's Kansas City Chiefs were participating in the inaugural Super Bowl. Lamar Hunt's Kansas City Chiefs returned to the Super Bowl in 1970 and defeated the Minnesota  Vikings by a score of 23-7 in Super Bowl IV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite his many accomplishments, Hunt's humility was one of his most unwavering and most endearing traits. While he modestly declined to take credit for his efforts, Hunt truly played an important role in the design, ongoing development and direction of the modern-day National Football League. Lamar Hunt was also a risk taker. He signed a great number of African-American players onto the Kansas City Chiefs football team at a time when few other football teams took that chance. So, Lamar Hunt  rose above the crowd and nestled on top of the football and sports apex where few others sat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it was employing more African-Americans, serving as the driving force behind the formation of the AFL, serving as a key player in the AFL-NFL merger talks in the '60s, or overseeing many crucial issues concerning pro football and the Chiefs franchise during the past 4 decades, few individuals helped change the face of America's favorite game for the better than this quiet Texan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being a principal negotiator in the merger of the AFL and NFL in the late '60s, he was a contributor to the design of the NFL playoff format. He is also credited with accidentally putting the name "Super Bowl" on the NFL's championship game--the name coming from his children's toy "Super Ball."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the founder of the AFL, he helped pave the way for much of the modern growth of pro football. Possibly the greatest tribute to his contributions to the sport was the naming by the league of the Lamar Hunt Trophy, which is presented annually to the champion of the American Football Conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing the enormous contributions Lamar Hunt has made the sports world and beyond.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate the gentleman from Missouri, the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver, for spearheading the effort in Congress to honor Kansas City Chiefs Founder Lamar Hunt, who passed away in December 2006 after living a long and distinguished life. As the Fifth District's U.S. representative and the former mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Mr. Cleaver understands better than anyone in the House how special Lamar Hunt's Chiefs are to the Kansas City community  and to people all throughout the Show-Me State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Missouri's Fourth District, which I am privileged to represent, includes portions of the Kansas City suburbs and most of the rural, west central section of the State. Many of the Missourians who call the Fourth District home are proud Chiefs fans. They don jerseys, t-shirts, hats, and flags emblazoned with the red team color of the Chiefs and travel great distances to watch the Chiefs play at Arrowhead Stadium. Among the people, there is a great deal of pride for the Chiefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Missourians who love the Kansas City Chiefs and the National Football League, NFL, owe a debt of gratitude to Chiefs founder Lamar Hunt, who in 1963 moved the Dallas Texans to Kansas City. For 40 years, Mr. Hunt owned and was a critical participant in the Chiefs football club. Under his leadership, the Chiefs won the American Football League Championship game in 1966 and in 1969 and won the National Football League Super Bowl IV Championship in 1970. And, while the team has been competitive through  most of its history, it experienced a renaissance after Mr. Hunt hired General Manager Carl Peterson in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hunt also helped mold the direction of the modern-day NFL and served as the driving force behind the merger of the American and National football leagues in 1970. He founded the American Football League at the age of 27 and created and named the championship game known as the Super Bowl. Throughout his career, he advocated for innovative and progressive changes to enhance the NFL, including the inclusion of the two point conversion option for professional football, placing names on the backs  of the uniforms, naming the Super Bowl trophy after Vince Lombardi, and adding another Thanksgiving game to the NFL schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of Mr. Hunt's work in football, he was enshrined in the Professional Football Hall of Fame in 1972, was inducted into the NFL Alumni Association's prestigious Order of the Leather Helmet, and received the Francis J. "Reds" Bagnell Award from the Maxwell Football Club of Philadelphia. The NFL also named the American Football Conference, AFC, trophy, which is presented each year to the AFC champion, the "Lamar Hunt Trophy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to football, Mr. Hunt was dedicated to other sports, including soccer, basketball, and tennis. He was also a highly successful businessman and philanthropist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lamar Hunt was a remarkable man. Though he was born in Arkansas and lived much of his life in Texas, his decision to establish the Kansas City Chiefs in Missouri has endeared him to Show-Me State residents. And, he made his mark in the history of  the United States by helping to create the NFL, which is revered by so many Americans. As the House of Representatives prepares to pass legislation today to honor Mr. Hunt's life and legacy, let  us remember his unique contributions to Missouri and to our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the late Lamar Hunt, a tireless contributor to the National Football League, NFL, and to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally from El Dorado, Arkansas, Lamar Hunt was educated in Texas at Southern Methodist University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology and served as a 3-year reserve end on the varsity football team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the young age of 27, Hunt persevered through much criticism and founded the Dallas Texans, now known as the Kansas City Chiefs, and facilitated the creation of the American Football League. By undertaking these two tasks, he paved the way for the expansion of professional football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt's impeccable management skills and keen perception of the game propelled him to spearhead groundbreaking developments in the NFL. These developments include, among many others, the installation of the 2-point conversion option and the inclusion of names on the back of game jerseys. Although known for such contributions to the NFL, Hunt's commitment to the community went far beyond the football field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hunt was an avid supporter of societal betterment, hosting and sponsoring many philanthropic efforts. He made significant financial contributions to higher learning institutions, the Heart of a Champion foundation, and the fine arts, notably the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Museum of Art.</paragraph>
