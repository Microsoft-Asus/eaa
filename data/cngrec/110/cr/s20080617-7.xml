  <narrative>TAX EXTENDER LEGISLATION -- (Senate - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5670">S5670</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday was a remarkably good day. When I got out of law school, I went back to Nevada and thought I would be this great golfer. I golfed for 6 months or so, and then realized I was becoming obsessed with the game. Therefore, I decided I shouldn't do this. I had a family, and it took so much time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a number of years, I have listened to my friends talk about how much they enjoy golf, and I am sure they do. But it has only been in recent years that the American public has focused on golf, and that is because of Tiger Woods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can remember the first time I watched this little boy play. They showed him on the late night shows. Of course, as we all know, it was taped a lot earlier before his bedtime. This little kid, when he was 3 years old, could do remarkable things with his golf club. That is the way it was through his entire career, including at Stanford University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the weekend, we all watched with attention while Rocco Mediate was going stroke for stroke with the great Tiger Woods. They tied in regulation play. They played an extra 18 holes. It was a tie. Finally, yesterday, it was concluded. All of us had mixed emotions as for whom we were pulling. Everyone likes Tiger Woods because he is so good and so nice, but we all also rooted for this underdog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one thing we noted yesterday is this golf tournament took place in San Diego. The sun was shining, and it was a beautiful day for golf. That is what the commentators kept saying. We were literally stuck in the rain yesterday. Those of us who were here last night about 4 o'clock saw a violent storm. There was lightning, thunder, driving rain, and lots of wind. As a result, I spoke with Senator McConnell, and we thought it was best to delay the vote. We had people calling saying: I am stuck in Richmond. One Senator was supposed to go to Dulles. She had to land in Richmond. Another Senator was stuck in Buffalo. We had people stuck all over the country. So we did this, and it was the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We intended to vote on the motion to proceed to the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act, known as the tax extender bill. Some on the other side, I am sure, may have welcomed yesterday's delay, but we are where we would have been last night. We need to return to a vote on the motion to proceed to the tax extender bill today, and we will do that, as has been indicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cornerstone of this legislation is an extension of incentives for businesses to invest in clean, renewable energy. Right now, we reward these innovators who are blazing the trail to a greater, cleaner, more affordable energy future, but we don't reward them very much. These people are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. The potential is out there. If we can pass this legislation, it would mean so much to the American economy and the world ecology, the world environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not just the Democrats talking. Somebody I have gotten to know over the years is a man by the name of T. Boone Pickens. As I understand, he is from the State of Texas. He has proven one thing: He knows how to make money. He has proven he is willing to take chances, and most always his chances turn out good at the bank for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What T. Boone Pickens has now decided to do is make money on renewable energy. He has done so much in the State of Texas alone. He, among others, thinks we should pass the legislation that is so important to give these tax credits to the American entrepreneurs so they will create jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is a chart: Republican filibusters and counting, 76. For a long time, we had to keep creating new charts because they kept filibustering so much and it got to be a burden. So what we have done is we put Velcro on this chart. We can peel these babies off. Because the Republicans are so often filibustering, we now have a Velcro chart. We hope we don't have to change this too much more, the "7," or change the "6." Of course, we changed that a couple times last week. The Republicans are  filibustering what T. Boone Pickens and others want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs out there we could create if we have this tax incentive. They are doing it other places. In Australia, they are in the process of constructing a solar energy plant. That one plant will be 10,000 megawatts. They can do that all over Australia. It is an Australian company that is heavily involved now in California and other parts of the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These tax credit extensions will continue to encourage the renewable energy industry in States all over the West, States that have wind and Sun, and some States, such as California or Nevada, have a lot of geothermal. If the Senate does not act to extend these tax incentives, this research and entrepreneurship will literally be in jeopardy. Thousands of Americans will lose jobs. They are already in the process of losing jobs because the tax credits are about to expire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need an opportunity to move away from $140 barrel oil imported from unstable regions and unfriendly governments. There is no problem facing America that American ingenuity cannot handle. Failing to pass this tax incentive legislation will mean stacking the deck against innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minority is saying we shouldn't pay for these extensions, we should run up the red ink. During the last 7 1/2  years, we have had the master at running up the red ink in the White House. We have now almost a $10 trillion deficit. We are saying we should pay for this legislation. The House has already done that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The setoffs are very simple. One tax that does not kick in we have extended on a number of occasions in the past. The Republicans did this. We want to do it again. We also believe these offshore shenanigans that are taking place in America where they put these phony companies offshore to get tax breaks should come to an end. And that is what we have done. Most of it would be directed toward billionaires. These hedge funders have recognized they had a good deal going, and they have indicated,  with rare exception, that they think it is a good idea. So it is not as if we are trying to ramrod some vicious tax increase to the American middle class. In fact, that is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot let this legislation fail, and the Republicans are going to let it fail unless we get cloture on this legislation. Not only does this legislation do good things for renewable energy and job creation, but it also expands the child tax credit for families of 13 million children; it provides as many as 30 million homeowners with property tax relief; it helps 4.5 million families afford the cost of college with the tuition deduction; it allows millions of teachers to deduct out-of-pocket  classroom expenses; and it levels the playing field by providing tax relief to people living in States with no income tax through the State and local sales tax deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our economy is losing jobs, for 6 months now losing jobs, hundreds of thousands of jobs. In the 8 years President Clinton was President, almost 23 million jobs were created. In this administration, it is quite to the contrary. The disastrous Bush economic policy is the reason we have these job losses, a policy that Republican nominee JOHN MCCAIN wants to preserve. We think this is wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With millions of Americans suffering from job loss, home foreclosures, record gas, energy, and grocery prices, there is no reason on Earth to oppose the bill before us now. I spoke with someone in New Mexico yesterday. He said his home has dropped in value by 50 percent. In many places in America, the value of homes has dropped 25 percent. This bill would create hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home, lower taxes for American businesses and families and lower energy prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, my friend, the Republican leader, indicated his caucus plans to oppose this legislation. Why? It seems,  as I have indicated, Republicans object to paying for these crucial tax cuts by eliminating an existing tax loophole that unfairly allows hedge-fund billionaires to avoid paying taxes. Even the hedge funders themselves realize this loophole is unfair and is destined to be corrected. Yesterday, hundreds of major American corporations sent  a letter to Congress urging that we pass the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to which I just referred.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>June 16, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR REID: The undersigned companies, representing a broad cross section of the U.S. business community and hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, request that the Senate take action during the current work period to extend tax provisions that expired at the end of 2007 or will expire at the end of 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>The House of Representatives last month passed a tax extenders package included in <bill type="h" number="6049">H.R. 6049</bill>, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which provides a good starting point for Senate consideration. In April, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley introduced <bill type="s" number="2886">S. 2886</bill> containing a tax extenders package, including a critical increase in the Alternative Simplified Credit to spur R&amp;D jobs in the United States. Swift action is now needed by the Senate to enact a tax  extenders package that will bring significant positive benefits to the U.S. economy.</narrative>
  <narrative>Important tax provisions, including the R&amp;D tax credit and the deduction for state and local sales taxes, have already expired. Others, including critical renewable energy incentives, the Subpart F active financial services and look-through rules, the New Markets Tax Credit, and the incentive for domestic film production, expire at the end of this year. Large tax increases would fall on American companies and American workers if the expired and expiring provisions are not extended.</narrative>
  <narrative>Failure by Congress to move quickly to extend these important provisions will bring investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects to a standstill, make it more difficult for U.S. companies to invest in critical R&amp;D projects in this country, reduce private sector investment in business and economic development projects in distressed areas, and force many U.S.-based financial institutions to suffer a massive tax increase at a time when they can least afford it.</narrative>
  <narrative>Failure to act this summer on tax extender legislation will have significant negative consequences for the U.S. economy. The value of the legislation to the U.S. economy and the need to act quickly at this critical time should be the dominant considerations.</narrative>
  <narrative>We look forward to working with you on this important legislation and urge action during Congress' June legislative session.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think it is glaring to note that of these major companies--hundreds and hundreds of them that have signed this letter--not a single oil company has signed on. Oil companies don't want us to do this legislation. They want us to keep being beholden to them. But look at the companies that signed onto this legislation: Genetech, Cummins Inc., The Chubb Corporation, Merck, Merrill Lynch, Microsoft, Owens Corning, Pfizer, U.S. Bank, Wachovia, Verizon, and Whirlpool Corporation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scores and scores of other major companies are telling our Republican colleagues to vote for legislation the way it is written. They know the bill and they list the number of it. The letter was signed by the "Who's Who" of the Fortune 500 companies and many others--titans of American business. Hundreds of small companies in addition to that all agree Congress needs to act now to extend tax incentives for clean energy and innovation to provide the American people with desperately needed tax  cuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We got nine Republicans when we voted on this last Thursday, and I publicly commended them. I hope we get more today. The record should be very clear that this, the 76th filibuster of the Republican minority, is something that is going to cause the further deterioration of the American economy. We want this legislation passed to help Americans wean themselves from that which is ruining our country economically and environmentally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we have some people who will join Boeing, General Electric, Coca Cola, Intel, and other companies I have mentioned and move forward with this legislation. It is vitally important for the American people.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
