    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the statewide effort my great State of New Mexico will put forth for the National Night Out. National Night Out is a community event  designed to bring awareness to preventing crime while building partnerships between communities and local law enforcement agencies. Crime is not limited to urban areas anymore; it affects every person in every town, big and small. Communities need to be proactive in fighting  it. National Night Out is a great step locals can take to curb violence and crime in their areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Activities for the night out include barbeques, block parties, downtown rallies and townhall meetings and vary by community; each event in an attempt to gain support for local law enforcement and create camaraderie amongst citizens. When communities come together, they can do great things, even fight crime. Some New Mexico communities participating in National Night Out are Albuquerque, Belen, Bernalillo, Bosque Farms, Carlsbad, Gallup, Isleta, Jal, Las Cruces, Los Lunas, all of Sandoval County,  Santa Fe, and Truth or Consequences. Each town will celebrate with its own flair, and each night out will succeed in bring awareness to crime in their area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud these neighborhoods for being proactive in their local fight on crime.</paragraph>
