    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have heard sentiments from the other side of the aisle about the vote that is going to take place today. I would like to throw a few facts on the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One, the President asked us 110 days ago for this support; 110 days. Nothing has changed with his request, the need for the support of the troops, from then until now, except we have gone through political exercises to try and limit the ability of the President and, more importantly, his commanders in the field, from doing what they think is best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard it said that we need a new policy. We have a new policy. I have heard it said, we need a new military commander. We have a new military commander. I have heard it said, we need new tactics. We have new tactics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, as the President has presented this, as we put this into effect, all we hear is, no, no, no, and no. That is not a policy; that is a denial. That does not support the troops. Unfortunately, it makes it more difficult for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's remember as we vote to support our troops, we could have done this and should have done this 110 days ago.</paragraph>
