    <paragraph>This is a season for joy and for giving, and it is a season where children's eyes particularly sparkle. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to pay tribute and thank the many, many volunteers that joined me on this past Saturday to provide, again, for the 13th Annual Toys for Kids Annual Holiday Program and Christmas Giveaway in the 18th Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many volunteers came from so many parts of our community. The faith community; fraternity and sorority community; the women's organizations; and schools came out to celebrate with our kids. NASA participated. Four astronauts came to celebrate and to compete, if you will, with Santa Claus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 3,000 children came to receive gifts, fellowship, to eat. But this could not have been done without all of the supporters and certainly all of the volunteers. I tip my hat to all of you for bringing joy to the children's hearts and minds this past Saturday, December 15, 2007. Again, a great success for the Kids Annual Holiday Program in Houston, Texas.</paragraph>
