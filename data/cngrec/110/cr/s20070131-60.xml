  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I could now move to the more mundane, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:45 tomorrow, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 8 through 10; that there be 10 minutes for debate on the nominations equally divided between Senators LEAHY and SPECTER or their designees; that at the conclusion of the yielding back of time, the Senate vote on nomination No. 8, Lawrence Joseph O'Neill to be a U.S. district  judge; that following that vote, the Senate vote on nomination No. 9, Valerie Baker, to be a U.S. district judge; that following that vote, the Senate vote on nomination No. 10, Gregory Frizzell, to be a U.S. district judge; that there be 2 minutes for debate between the votes;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say, before the Chair rules on this unanimous consent request, how much we can count on staff. One number was missing, and I am just here trying to figure out what to do without staff, and as usual, they come through.</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader quickly got to the correction. Is there objection?</chair>
