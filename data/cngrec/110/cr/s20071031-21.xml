  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am in support of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of this critical legislation is truly a great achievement. For New Yorkers, Amtrak is not just a commodity but a life source. Passenger rail is an essential element of our transportation network that provides irreplaceable capacity and mobility to New York and the Nation. For the past near 7 years, we have had to fight the administration's constant attempts to privatize and dismantle our Nation's premier passenger rail service, Amtrak. Eliminating Amtrak service would be an economic  disaster and an irresponsible policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as gas prices continue to climb and airline delays are at an alltime high, Amtrak not only provides a necessary and affordable alternative to our congested airways, it links commuters to local locations not serviced by the airline industry. The enactment of Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 will end the stop-gap funding process for Amtrak and will provide the traveling public with the security of a comprehensive plan for improving our nation's passenger rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No country in the world has ever developed and maintained a successful passenger railroad system without assistance from their national government. Without offering an alternative, President Bush has aimed to simply shut down passenger rail in the US.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This plan will authorize $19.2 billion in Federal funds for Amtrak by providing $3.2 billion over the next 6 years and will allow Amtrak to make critical repairs and improvements to its service. Funding under this legislation will allow Amtrak to implement a comprehensive plan that will enhance rail security, reduce train delays, and improve customer service. It will also provide sufficient funding and direction to bring the Northeast corridor up to a "state-of-good-repair," including vital  tunnel life safety work in the Hudson River Tunnels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, attempts by Congress to improve and modernize Amtrak's operations were stalled by the Republican-controlled House, and earlier this year the President proposed cutting $493 million, more than 38 percent of Amtrak's operating funds. This sort of backward thinking would have severely jeopardized Amtrak's ability to serve their passenger lines in New York and throughout the Northeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the State of New York, Amtrak operates 140 routes, employs more than 1,900 people, and has 2 of the top 10 busiest stations in their rail system. Amtrak is an integral part of our transportation infrastructure and continues to service parts of the State that need the influx of tourists, business travelers, and others. The future without Amtrak for New York would be devastating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the full Senate has rejected the administration's approach to Amtrak. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I commend Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott for their leadership in steering this critically important legislation through the Senate. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I am pleased that my Senate colleagues have voted overwhelmingly to continue to provide critical funding for Amtrak, and I look forward to this legislation being signed  into law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate made a strong and long-overdue investment in the future of public transit in Rhode Island and throughout the country. I am pleased to have cast my vote for the passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 (PRIIA), which will guide the maintenance, growth, and funding of the railroad through Fiscal Year 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, over 12 million business and leisure travelers depend on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor service, which connects the great cities of New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Providence is a vital link on this route, with more than half a million Amtrak passengers boarding and departing Amtrak trains in the city each year. Also on the Northeast corridor route are Kingston and Westerly, Rhode Island. Kingston is home to the University of Rhode Island, and Amtrak gives students, faculty,  researchers, and visitors direct access to this thriving college town. The Westerly station provides rail service to residents of both Rhode Island and Connecticut who rely on public transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite its importance to millions of travelers, the Northeast Corridor has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. The infrastructure on this route is some of the oldest in the Nation, and a revitalization plan has been necessary for some time. This new Amtrak bill includes a strategy to restore the route to good condition by September of 2012--the first capital development plan put in place since Amtrak's previous authorization expired 5 years ago--and authorizes full federal funding  of necessary repairs and upgrades. The Amtrak bill also authorizes the formation of a commission to oversee the operation and maintenance of the Northeast Corridor. The commission will include Amtrak, the Federal Railroad Administration, and each state along the route. I am pleased that Rhode Island will have a voice in future planning for a resource so vital to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to funding operations and capital improvements, the Amtrak bill also addresses the congestion experienced on so many of the system's routes. By law, Amtrak passenger trains have the right of way over private freight trains, but this preference is often ignored. The bill the Senate passed today permits the Surface Transportation Board to assess fines against non-compliant freight railroads and to distribute damages to Amtrak. Congestion has increased in recent years, especially along  the Northeast Corridor, and this provision should lead to fewer and shorter delays for passengers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let us celebrate a piece of good Rhode Island news--I have been informed that the escalators in the Providence train station, which have been broken and covered with dust since early 2005, are scheduled to be reopened and in service by the week of November 12.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Senators FRANK LAUTENBERG of New Jersey and TRENT LOTT of Mississippi on the passage of this critical piece of legislation. I also want to recognize the contributions of Rhode Island's own Senator JACK REED, who has been a strong and constant advocate for Amtrak. The new resources and clear development plan outlined in this bill reaffirm Congress's commitment to passenger rail service in the United States.</paragraph>
