  <speaking speaker="412229" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today this House will debate legislation that will help us fulfill our commitment to this Nation's service men and women, their families and our veterans. The Military Construction bill that comes to the floor today was unanimously approved out of the House Appropriations Committee last week. Not one Democrat or Republican opposed the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is because it provides the largest increase in funding for veterans health care in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration and includes other historic funding increases designed to meet the changing need of our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill unanimously passed out of the Appropriations Committee for a reason: it is a good bill and deserves the support of every Member of this House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
