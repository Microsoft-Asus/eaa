  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week, my colleagues from the Great Lakes and I introduced the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2008. This bill will reauthorize the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002, which significantly benefited efforts to clean up contaminated areas of the Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The focus of the Legacy program is to clean up "Areas of Concern" in the Great Lakes. These are sites that do not meet the water quality goals established by the United States and Canada in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The primary reason that these areas fail to meet water quality goals is the result of contaminated sediments from industrial activity. This contamination results in fish advisories, degradation of fish and wildlife populations, taste and odor problems with drinking  water, beach closures, and bird and animal deformities or reproductive problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The existing Legacy program has funded several projects throughout the region to remove contaminated sediments in Areas of Concern. In fact, almost 800,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediments have been removed since the program was created in 2002. This is material that has been safely removed from riverbeds so that it no longer poses a threat to human health or the wildlife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, there are 13 Areas of Concern in the State of Michigan alone. The environmental problems are far too grave considering the fact that the Great Lakes holds one-fifth of the world's freshwater, supplies drinking water to tens of million people, and provides a $5 billion fishery. They threaten the Great Lakes as a source of potable water, as a recreational resource, as a commercial asset, and as a natural habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill that we have introduced would build on the existing Legacy program in several ways. It would increase the authorization of appropriations from $54 million to $150 million annually in order to clean up the Areas of Concern within 10 years. The bill would give the EPA greater flexibility to manage funds by allowing the EPA to distribute funds directly to contractors and would not require States to maintain previous year's funding levels at a  site.  Under this bill, eligible projects would be expanded to include habitat restoration. Many Areas of Concern cannot be delisted until habitat restoration work is done. Also, the bill would give the EPA the discretion to provide Legacy Act funds to demonstration and pilot projects. Finally, the bill would clarify the role of polluters in participating in future projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been working for decades to try to clean up the Areas of Concern. This bill was drafted based on recommendations from a coalition of environmental and industry groups that are working to protect and restore the Great Lakes, and I want to thank them for their dedication. I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation to continue progress on cleaning up these sites and protecting our precious Great LakA for the use and benefit of citizens throughout the Midwest and across Nation.</paragraph>
