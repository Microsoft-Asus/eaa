    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we begin our work in the new year, I want to take a few moments to reflect on the passing of a good friend of mine. Richard Henry "Dick" White, Jr., a fixture in Washington for four decades, lost his fight against cancer on December 21, and his death took a whole lot of sunshine from the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many who came to Washington, Dick White expected to stay in Washington for a very short period of time. A 1955 journalism graduate of the University of Oklahoma, Dick arrived here in 1965 as a correspondent for the Tulsa Tribune. But rather than return home, he moved to public service, and that work caused him to become a congressional staff member over the next 14 years. He was the top staffer for Ed Edmonson of Oklahoma and Dale Milford of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He left the Hill in the late 1970s to serve as Washington representative on a number of farm-related issues. He later served as the vice president for the Tobacco Institute, and most recently maintained a small public affairs consulting business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has regrettably become vogue in politics to suggest that lobbying, that is, representing the American people in Washington, is less than an honorable profession. Well, anyone who knew Dick White would strongly disagree. He represented his clients, small businesses, tens of thousands of farmers, hundreds of thousands of workers, with integrity, humanity and a wealth of knowledge. His service helped thousands of Americans be treated fairly when Congress considered policy changes  that would affect their livelihoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to know Dick White as a friend after his marriage in 1991 to one of my senior staff members, Letitia Hoadley. To say this pair was a devoted couple is putting it mildly. For the past 15 years they have been inseparable and tenderly have cared for each other through good times and bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dick White was always welcome in my office as a member of our extended  staff family. But his optimism and good humor made him welcome anywhere he went. He always added a bit of sunshine on any visit, and left everyone feeling more positive towards the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond his public affairs interests, Dick was an avid follower of college sports, including Oklahoma football. He loved to travel, especially to the Caribbean. But his greatest joy was to spend time at his weekend cottage in Southern Maryland where he enjoyed boating, gardening and swimming. He loved to entertain. He would revel in a swimming pool full of kids. He was a great listener, and was considered a great grandpa by every boy and girl who was lucky enough to spend time with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even as Dick battled cancer in the last few years, he maintained his positive nature, hearty laugh, infectious smile, always a part of Dick's life. In his last summer he purchased a small boat, hired an instructor, and provided a sailing school for neighborhood kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dick White is survived by his loving wife Letitia and her family; his daughter, Ann Calvert Brown; son-in-law Stephen Brown; and grandchildren Suzanne Noel Brown and Daniel Calvert Brown. He is also survived by siblings, Miles White of San Antonio, Texas; Elizabeth White George of Belfair, Washington; and Robert White of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as well as their families, including numerous nieces, nephews and their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Dick White, a man of all seasons, gave all who knew him a reason to believe in the value of friendship as we go forward in life. He would have told us not to mourn his passing, but rather to celebrate the life he lived in his time with us. In that spirit, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering a wonderful husband, father and friend to all and to express our warmest good will to his family.</paragraph>
