  <narrative>A PRETEND BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8400]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is a song in a Broadway musical that reads "there's a fine, fine line between reality and pretend." That signifies, I think, what this House has been doing this last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a real energy crisis that's harming people. There was a real energy solution, an all-of-the-above, that was not allowed the courtesy of an open debate. Instead, we passed a pretend bill that pretended to open up the offshore when it did not, that pretended that the oil in ANWR does not exist, that pretended that coal and nuclear is not a part of our solution, that pretended that there is enough money to develop alternative sources when there is not, that pretended to be a serious solution,  but all it did is allow anybody, whether they voted for or against it, to go home to his or her district and say, "I did something on energy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were on the cusp of doing something great, but instead, the reality is all we did is legitimize the cynicism people have of this particular body. We could have done so much more. The fact that we did not is a sad indictment of the process of this Congress.</paragraph>
