A diligent effort will ordinarily be based on best practices, as applicable, and any other actions reasonable and appropriate under the facts relevant to  that search, including further actions based on facts uncovered during the initial search, and be performed before, and at a time reasonably proximate to, the infringement.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) LACK OF IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.--The fact that a particular copy or phonorecord lacks identifying information pertaining to the owner of the infringed copyright is not sufficient to meet the conditions under paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(iii) USE OF RESOURCES FOR CHARGE.--A qualifying search under paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I) may include use of resources for which a charge or subscription fee is imposed, to the extent that the use of such resources is reasonable for, and relevant to, the scope of the intended use.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) INFORMATION TO GUIDE SEARCHES; BEST PRACTICES.--</narrative>
  <narrative> "(i) STATEMENTS OF BEST PRACTICES.--The Register of Copyrights shall maintain and make available to the public, including through the Internet, at least 1 statement of best practices for each category, or, in the Register's discretion, subcategory of work under section 102(a) of this title, for conducting and documenting a search under this subsection, which will ordinarily include reference to materials relevant to a search. The Register may maintain more than 1 statement for each category  or subcategory, as appropriate.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) CONSIDERATION OF RELEVANT MATERIALS.--The Register of Copyrights shall, from time to time, update or modify each statement of best practices at the Register's discretion and should, in maintaining and updating such statements, consider materials and any relevant guidelines submitted to the Register that, in the Register's discretion, are reasonable and relevant to the requirements of a qualifying search, and databases for pictorial, graphical, and sculptural works, where appropriate  and reasonably available for a given use.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(3) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY.--If an infringer fails to comply with any requirement under this subsection, the infringer is not eligible for a limitation on remedies under this section.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(c) Limitations on Remedies.--The limitations on remedies in an action for infringement of a copyright to which this section applies are the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(1) MONETARY RELIEF.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) GENERAL RULE.--Subject to subparagraph (B), an award for monetary relief (including actual damages, statutory damages, costs, and attorney's fees) may not be made other than an order requiring the infringer to pay reasonable compensation to the owner of the exclusive right under the infringed copyright for the use of the infringed work.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) FURTHER LIMITATIONS.--An order requiring the infringer to pay reasonable compensation for the use of the infringed work may not be made under subparagraph (A) if the infringer is a nonprofit educational institution, museum, library, archives, or a public broadcasting entity (as defined in subsection (f) of section 118), or any of such entities' employees acting within the scope of their employment, and the infringer proves by a preponderance of the evidence that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) the infringement was performed without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) the infringement was primarily educational, religious, or charitable in nature; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(iii) after receiving a notice of claim of infringement, and having an opportunity to conduct an expeditious good faith investigation of the claim, the infringer promptly ceased the infringement.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(2) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) GENERAL RULE.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the court may impose injunctive relief to prevent or restrain any infringement alleged in the civil action. If the infringer has met the requirements of subsection (b), the relief shall, to the extent practicable and subject to applicable law, account for any harm that the relief would cause the infringer due to its reliance on subsection (b).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) EXCEPTION.--In a case in which the infringer has prepared or commenced preparation of a new work of authorship that recasts, transforms, adapts, or integrates the infringed work with a significant amount of original expression, any injunctive relief ordered by the court may not restrain the infringer's continued preparation or use of that new work, if--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) the infringer pays reasonable compensation in a reasonably timely manner after the amount of such compensation has been agreed upon with the owner of the infringed copyright or determined by the court; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) the court also requires that the infringer provide attribution, in a manner that is reasonable under the circumstances, to the legal owner of the infringed copyright, if requested by such owner.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) LIMITATIONS.--The limitations on injunctive relief under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not be available to an infringer if the infringer asserts in the action that neither the infringer nor any representative of the infringer acting in an official capacity is subject to suit in the courts of the United States for an award of damages for the infringement, unless the court finds that the infringer--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(i) has complied with the requirements of subsection (b); and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(ii) has made an enforceable promise to pay reasonable compensation to the owner of the exclusive right under the infringed copyright.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(D) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.--Nothing in subparagraph (C) shall be construed to authorize or require, and no action taken under such subparagraph shall be deemed to constitute, either an award of damages by the court against the infringer or an authorization to sue a State.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(E) RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES NOT WAIVED.--No action taken by an infringer under subparagraph (C) shall be deemed to waive any right or privilege that, as a matter of law, protects the infringer from being subject to suit in the courts of the United States for an award of damages.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(d) Preservation of Other Rights, Limitations, and Defenses.--This section does not affect any right, or any limitation or defense to copyright infringement, including fair use, under this title. If another provision of this title provides for a statutory license that would permit the use contemplated by the infringer, that provision applies instead of this section.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(e) Copyright for Derivative Works and Compilations.--Notwithstanding section 103(a), an infringer who qualifies for the limitation on remedies afforded by this section shall not be denied copyright protection in a compilation or derivative work on the basis that such compilation or derivative work employs preexisting material  that has been used unlawfully under this section.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(f) Exclusion for Fixations in or on Useful Articles.--The limitations on remedies under this section shall not be available to an infringer for infringements resulting from fixation of a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work in or on a useful article that is offered for sale or other distribution to the public.".</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in January 2005, Senator Hatch and I wrote to the Register of Copyrights out of a concern that the length of copyright terms was having an unintended consequence of creating a class of "orphan works"--works that may be protected by copyright, but whose owners cannot be identified or located. Creative works are collecting dust because those who would like to bring them to light are respectful of the copyright laws and will not use those works if they cannot  locate the owners. This unfortunate situation is keeping creative and cultural works from the public, and does not advance the purpose of the copyright laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Senate completes work on legislation I introduced along with Senator Hatch to remedy this situation. The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008 is designed to enable use of works whose copyright status and ownership is uncertain without the user facing prohibitive statutory damages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The act does not dramatically restructure current copyright law--it does not impose new registration requirements, nor does it provide for a transfer of copyright ownership or rights. The bill simply provides for a limitation on remedies in discrete, limited circumstances in which, among other things, the owner of the work is not locatable. Any infringer who wishes to use an orphan works limitation on remedies must perform a diligent search in good faith, document that search, and, in the event  that the owner emerges, negotiate with the copyright owner in good faith regarding reasonable compensation. If any of these conditions, or others set forth in the bill, is not met, the limitation on remedies is unavailable and an infringer faces the full statutory damages as well as costs and attorney's fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At its core, the bill seeks to unite users and copyright owners, and to ensure that copyright owners are compensated for the use of their works. It does not create any orphans, and it does not create a license to infringe. By providing an incentive to search, in the form of a limitation on remedies, more users will find more owners; more works otherwise hidden will be used; and more copyright owners will receive compensation. The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act will thus allow the public to enjoy  works that are currently left unseen and unused. I hope the House can take up this measure, and send it to the President for signature.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued support for the Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008, <bill type="s" number="2913">S. 2913</bill>, which I introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy. This bill represents years of hard work and collaboration by the Senate, industry stakeholders, and U.S. Copyright Office officials. Passing <bill type="s" number="2913">S. 2913</bill> is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Leahy for naming <bill type="s" number="2913">S. 2913</bill> as the Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008. It honors my long-time staffer and former colleague, Shawn Bentley. As many of you may remember, Shawn worked for the Judiciary Committee for a decade and worked on several important pieces of landmark intellectual property legislation. In fact, he initiated what we have now introduced as an orphan works bill. Many in this body were greatly saddened by Shawn's untimely death at 41. He was  a one-of-a-kind individual. I believe this bill is a fitting way to acknowledge his continuing contributions to intellectual property law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Countless artistic creations around the country are effectively locked away in a proverbial attic and unavailable for the general public to enjoy because the owner of the copyright for the work is unknown. These are generally referred to as orphan works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, it is not always easy to identify an owner of a copyrighted work, and in many cases, information about the copyright holder is not publicly known. To make matters worse, many are discouraged from using these works for fear of being sued should the owner eventually step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many libraries, museums, State and local historical societies, and archives across the country that have significant amounts of orphan works, which are not currently available publicly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think of the new educational opportunities that will be opened to students, scholars, and the public alike when these works become accessible. The potential for learning, scholarship, and enjoyment of the works of previous generations are unlimited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without doubt, passage of <bill type="s" number="2913">S. 2913</bill> addresses the orphan works problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, Marybeth Peters, Register of the Copyrights, wrote the following about the importance of orphan works legislation:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation is sensible: it would ease the orphan problem by reducing, but not eliminating, the exposure of good faith users. But there are clear conditions designed to protect copyright owners. A user must take all reasonable steps, employ all reasonable technology, and execute the applicable search practices to be submitted to the Copyright Office by authors, associations, and other experts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The user must meet other hurdles, including attaching an orphan symbol to the use, to increase transparency and the possibility that an owner may emerge. If an owner does emerge, the user must pay `reasonable compensation' or face full liability. Reasonable compensation will be mutually agreed by the owner and the user or, failing that, be decided by a court; but it must also reflect objective market values for the work and the use. This framework would facilitate projects that are global (think  rare text in the hands of a book publisher) as well as local (think family portraits in the hands of a photo finisher), while preserving the purpose and potential of copyright law. It would not inject orphan works prematurely into the public domain, create an automatic exception for all uses, or create a permanent class of orphan works. Nor would it minimize the value of any one orphan work by mandating a government license and statutory rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Peters continues by stating:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some critics believe that the legislation is unfair because it will deprive copyright owners of injunctive relief, statutory damages, and actual damages. I do not agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me repeat, The Register of Copyrights does not believe the legislation is unfair, or that it will deprive copyright owners of injunctive relief, statutory damages, and actual damages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With 43 years of experience working in the Copyright Office, 14 of them as the Register, I trust that Ms. Peters knows a few things about copyright law. And I want to take this opportunity to thank her and her staff and the many other stakeholders for their tremendous assistance in crafting this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank my counsel Matt Sandgren and Aaron Cooper, Senator Leahy's counsel, for their perseverance and hard work on this initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, a solution to the orphan works problem is achievable and the pending legislation is both fair and responsible. I urge my colleagues to pass <bill type="s" number="2913">S. 2913</bill> without further delay.</paragraph>
