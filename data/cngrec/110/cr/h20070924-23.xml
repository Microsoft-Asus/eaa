    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>, a bill to establish the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill> was introduced by Representative John Sarbanes on March 7, 2007. This legislation was reported from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on July 19, 2007, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the War of 1812 was fought between the United States and Great Britain from June 1812 to the spring of 1815. During this time, a young lawyer by the name of Francis Scott Key witnessed the last assault by the British against Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He was so inspired by the fort's still standing with its huge flag flying in the breeze of victory that Mr. Key wrote a poem celebrating this battle and the flag. He composed the lines about our great flag, the Star-Spangled Banner,  which later became our country's national anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>, a bill that will establish the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission to encourage, plan and execute programs commemorating the historic events that are associated with the War of 1812.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would commend Representative Sarbanes for introducing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission Act. The commission established by this legislation would be responsible for developing programs, observations, and activities commemorating the historic events associated with the War of 1812. The commission would also enhance the visitor experience at the War of 1812 sites and facilitate scholarly research on the people and events associated with the War of 1812. This legislation  would provide for appropriate commemorative activities to increase public understanding, particularly that of young people, of the meaning of the War of 1812 and the history of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is much to be learned about the effect of the War of 1812 on American history, including the victories at Fort McHenry, New Orleans and Plattsburg. As one example, it is often overlooked or even forgotten that Francis Scott Key wrote the Star-Spangled Banner during the War of 1812.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The commission is intending to raise public awareness through observations that will bring this important chapter in American history to thousands of visitors. I urge support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he might consume to the author of this legislation, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission Act, which I had the privilege of introducing. This legislation would empower a commission to plan and coordinate what I believe is going to be one of the most spectacular and memorable commemorations in recent history in this country, and that is the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812 and the Francis Scott Key poem written during the British bombardment of  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H10716]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Park Service recommended the creation of such a commission in a 2004 study. Its membership would be drawn from citizens from historically significant States, from National Park Service officials, historical experts, and other individuals selected by congressional leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we are fast approaching the bicentennial of the War of 1812, I am pleased the House has taken up this legislation. I hope that the Senate will do so as well and the measure can be signed into law in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many refer to the War of 1812 as the "second war of independence." When the war began, our fragile experiment in democracy was still in its early stages, and the Nation found itself under attack from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Many wondered whether a democracy could hold together through the trials of war. The War of 1812 proved that it could, and set the stage for the spread of democracy around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Chairman Davis for bringing this measure to the floor. I hope all of my colleagues will support the bill, which will help ensure a fitting celebration of the War of 1812 and the Star-Spangled Banner bicentennial.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank Mr. Sarbanes for introducing this very important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is imperative for all Americans to know our early American history. Soon after the War of Independence and American independence, the new struggling United States had to go to war again with England to keep its independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes the War of 1812 is referred to as the forgotten war in American history. It is referred to as the "second American War of Independence." Be that as it may, we went to war with England a second time because the British kidnapped American sailors on the high seas and made them involuntary servants in the British Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the British invaded the United States during the War of 1812, they burned this city, Washington. They used Thomas Jefferson's books to burn this Capitol. They burned the White House. The President had to flee in the darkness of a torrential rainstorm. The United States future looked bleak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So after capturing Washington, DC, the British headed north to finish the United States off in Baltimore. During a heated sea battle, the British bombarded Fort McHenry, defending the harbor of Baltimore. But the fort commander stood defiant, refused to surrender, and hoisted a massive American flag over the fort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is no small flag. It is 30 feet by 42 feet in size. Such a flag could be seen for miles and miles away from Fort McHenry. An American lawyer named Francis Scott Key was onboard a British ship during the battle. He was there seeking the release of an American captive. After watching the night battle and seeing the glorious U.S. flag at sunrise, he wrote a poem, later turned into a song called the Star-Spangled Banner to honor this American victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This national anthem of ours is played at sports games and ceremonies and events across the Nation every day. In fact, I think the first time it was played at a sporting event was at a Chicago White Sox game in the early 1900s. Chairman Davis could correct me if that is incorrect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is important that Americans understand what the anthem stands for and why it was written. I totally support <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>. This bill will create a commission to plan activities, programs and observances of history events surrounding this War of 1812. I am proud of how the United States as a new democracy developed into a great Nation during this time. This war and Francis Scott Key should be celebrated and honored and recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the way, Mr. Speaker, the British left the United States permanently after the battle of Fort McHenry and after Andrew Jackson and his boys defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the majority has offered an amendment that I think improves this bill. I support the amendment and would encourage others to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>, establishing the Star-Spangled and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for his introduction of this bill, and I would urge passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>, as amended, and I want to commend the gentleman from Maryland for introducing this legislation and for bringing to our attention the importance of the War of 1812, the importance of our Star-Spangled Banner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also take this opportunity to commend my elementary school teachers, especially Mrs. Beadie King, who taught in a one-room school, who was so good that she could teach about the Star-Spangled Banner and you could feel shivers kind of going up and down your back. I am so pleased that I can still at times feel those and recognize perhaps what Francis Scott Key may have been thinking and what he may have been feeling when he looked up and saw that the flag was still standing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) again for introducing this legislation and urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>, the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which is of great importance to my constituents in Northern New York. Thus, I greatly appreciate the work the Gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, the Gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, and the Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Davis, have done to bring <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill>  to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent New York's 23rd Congressional District, which encompasses most of Northern New York. From Lake Champlain in the east, my District runs along the St. Lawrence River and our nation's Northern border to Lake Ontario in the west. The District encompasses territory that played an important role in our nation's early history; much of it was literally on the front lines of the War of 1812.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the War of 1812, my District was not only the site of skirmishes but also the significant Battles of Plattsburgh and Sackets Harbor. In fact, 193 years ago on September 11, 1814, Commodore Thomas McDonough repulsed a British invasion led by Sir George Provost at Plattsburgh Bay on Lake Champlain. McDonough's victory was significant because it ended a grave threat and gave impetus to then-ongoing peace negotiations. Likewise, but earlier during the war and on the other side of the District,  Brigadier General Jacob Brown stopped a British invasion led by Sir George Provost and Commodore James Yeo at Sackets Harbor. Of note, Sackets Harbor was the United States' main shipbuilding naval base on Lake Ontario.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to providing a mechanism to properly remember and honor these and other significant events in our nation's history, <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill> is also important to my constituents because of its potential to help increase tourism. Tourism is an important component of the economy in New York's 23rd District and is a cornerstone of efforts to further much-needed economic development. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to vote for <bill type="h" number="1389">H.R. 1389</bill> today and I look forward to working further to enact this legislation.</paragraph>
