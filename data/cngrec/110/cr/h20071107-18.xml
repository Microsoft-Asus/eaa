    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the world stumbles toward the Communist propaganda extravaganza labeled the Beijing Olympics, somewhere Chairman Mao is looking up at us and laughing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Catholic News Agency, Bibles and all other religious symbols are among Communist China's list of athletes' "prohibited objects" due to "security concerns."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the leader of the Free World, President Bush, has articulated his eagerness to attend Communist China's Olympics, I am compelled to ask three questions:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, how many Bibles will you be taking to Beijing? Will you visit the five bishops and 15 priests in prison for opposing the Communist regime's official church? And will you tell China's Communist tyrants this fundamental truth: No good government denies God's presence.</paragraph>
