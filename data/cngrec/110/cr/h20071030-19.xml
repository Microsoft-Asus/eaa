    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Red Sox Nation. In this House, we often disagree on many issues of national importance, but today we are all part of Red Sox Nation. After trailing Cleveland 3-1 in the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox won seven straight games and won their second World Series crown in 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of New Hampshire, we are made up of diehard Red Sox fans, and we are a proud part of Red Sox Nation. There is no such thing as a fair-weather Red Sox fan. Granite Staters went four generations without being able to celebrate a Red Sox championship, and that is why it has been a great week and great year to be a Red Sox fan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to congratulate Mike Lowell on being named the MVP of the series. Now we can all finally get some sleep. Go Sox.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
