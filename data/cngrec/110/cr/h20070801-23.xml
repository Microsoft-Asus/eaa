    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the rising cost of health care in this country. While the nature of health care makes reaching consensus difficult, Congress must take action to make health care more affordable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this reason, I have introduced <bill type="h" number="853">H.R. 853</bill>, the Wellness and Prevention Act of 2007. This legislation encourages the implementation of wellness and prevention plans in the workplace. The bill allows companies and employees to collect tax credits for wellness programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statistics have proven that every dollar a business spends on a wellness program results in a $3 return. Furthermore, Americans will take charge of their own health, thereby increasing productivity and reducing absenteeism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite my colleagues to sponsor <bill type="h" number="853">H.R. 853</bill>, because as the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Congress must now act to reduce the risk of disease, encourage a healthier America and help curb the rising cost of health care.</paragraph>
