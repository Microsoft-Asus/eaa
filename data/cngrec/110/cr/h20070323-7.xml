  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Four years ago, Congress was told we had no alternative but to go to war; that was wrong. Now Congress is telling the American people we have no alternative but to continue the war, and that by continuing the war for just another year or two we will then be able to end the war. War equals peace. I don't think so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This war has achieved a momentum that has swept up into its tragic hold people of otherwise good will who would vote to continue a war when they really want peace and when the American people want peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe you cannot say you are for peace and vote to keep this war going. You cannot say you are for peace and facilitate the theft of Iraqi oil. You cannot say you are for peace and give the President enough money not just to keep this war going, but to attack Iran if he so chooses. If you want peace, vote for peace now. If you want peace, stop funding this war. If you want peace, stand for the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What America must do and what Congress has the power to do is to stop the war now, use the money in the pipeline to bring the troops home, set in motion a diplomatic process that would involve the world community in moving into Iraq as our troops move out. We need to stand for peace. <bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill> is the vehicle to do that</paragraph>
