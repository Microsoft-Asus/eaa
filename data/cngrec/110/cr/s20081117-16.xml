  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, given the recent news about Secretary Paulson's execution of the TARP program, I firmly believe action is required by Congress. This morning, I introduced <bill type="s" number="3683">S. 3683</bill>. That is legislation that would do two things. It would freeze remaining money of the first $300 billion that has not already been expended and, secondly, it would change the process by which Secretary Paulson would access the second $350 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Secretary Paulson first came to the Senate and explained his plan, it was on a conference call. I happened to be in on that conference call. It was September 19. At that time, he was talking about the crisis that is upon us, that we have to do something, we have to do something big. It has to be $700 billion. It has to be done right now. The only way to do it is to buy troubled assets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that time, I asked some questions. One question was: If there are assets that are going to be bought, what is the criteria that will be used to determine which assets should be bought? There was not an answer to that question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second question was: Which institutions that are holding these assets would be the ones that would be eligible for this buyout? There were no answers to that question either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was on a Friday. Then as the next few days went by, we had several conversations. I didn't have any personal conversation with him except in one conference lunch, and that is, Is this the only way to do it? Yes, it is going to be buying out troubled assets. Still the answers were not there to those questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my statement opposing--I voted against the Paulson plan last month-- in my statement opposing it, I laid out three primary reasons I voted no. The first is that I was not convinced that the asset purchase program was the right way to do this. Apparently, he didn't think so either because that is not what he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second is that it would lead to increased lobbying for handouts and bailouts by any industry facing financial trouble. Now we are seeing that. We are seeing the auto industry coming in, some insurance companies and others coming in. It is kind of a new way of life: If you are not successful, don't worry about it because you have the Federal Government there to help you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third is that we were handing over, as I read it--and I don't blame Secretary Paulson for this because I suppose if this is what he wanted, somebody else was willing to put it together. He was not the one, I suppose, who drafted it. But it gave one person, in this case Secretary Paulson, the sole authority over $700 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a hard time with big numbers, putting them into perspective that is understandable. But it is my understanding that there are 139 million American families who file tax returns. If you do your math, this would be $5,000 per family. We are talking about any family out there who files taxes. This is a huge thing. So it does require extraordinary thought in addressing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I stated at the time, my vote was against the Paulson plan, not against taking action to provide necessary confidence in financial markets. I do know and agree that there is a problem out there. I am not convinced that is the way to address it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We critics were right. On October 14, in a significant shift, Treasury outlined a plan to directly purchase equity stakes in major financial institutions. The Wall Street Journal noted that "critics ..... say Treasury should have formulated a comprehensive plan earlier in the crisis." This past week, Secretary Paulson announced that he has completed a remarkable about-face, as summarized by the November 13 Investors Business Daily front-page headline which read: "Major Reversal, Treasury Won't  Buy Bad Mortgage Debt." This is a complete reversal. Why did Paulson reverse course? Last Thursday's Los Angeles Times provides the answer:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson's decision to abandon plans to buy troubled bank assets shows that he has come to two conclusions about what was once the chief focus of the government's $700-billion bailout: The first is that it wouldn't work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is kind of full circle. This is what we thought at the time, and this is where we are today. I know many have serious concerns about how Secretary Paulson has executed the financial rescue program, and I share those concerns. Congress completely abdicated its responsibility by signing a truly blank check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we look at this and if we read it, there is nothing  in there that says we have to do this. Never before in the history of America has anyone--elected or, in this case, unelected--been given a blank check or a check in the amount of $700 billion to do with as he wishes. It has never happened before. It is unprecedented. But that is exactly what happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we are faced with a lameduck session. We can do something about resolving this problem now, and that is supporting and passing the legislation I introduced this morning. It is officially introduced. I believe I requested it be sent to the Senate Banking Committee. I am sure there are several there who want to resolve this problem before we recess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern is this: The way it is set up by law, there is $350 billion already out there, and he has been spending that money. Frankly, I don't know how much has already been spent. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago that said all but $60 billion has been spent. That may be true; it may not be true. I have no way of knowing. That alone is enough concern that a senior Member of the Senate doesn't even know how much of the taxpayers' money has been spent or what  percentage of the $350 billion has been spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a second $350 billion to make up the $700 billion that will come, but it is rather nebulous, it is rather vague as to how that would be put into the hands of Secretary Paulson. My interpretation is that he would indicate, yes, we do need to have the second $350 billion, and if there was not a resolution to stop that, to preclude that from happening, then he would be able to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern is that we will stall around and do nothing. We will adjourn and not come back until January. That would give him the opportunity of stating his intention, what he wants to do, and then have 15 days go by when we are not even in session. I think the only way to do this is to do it the way we are planning to do it now; that is, to bite the bullet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know it is difficult. It is difficult for members of any body, particularly the Senate. This legislation, as I recall, passed 75 to 24. Those of us who are among the 24, who voted against it, are fine in terms of doing something such as this, but at least a third of those who voted for it would have to say he didn't do what he said he would do, he didn't buy the troubled assets. Therefore, that gives me reason to change. I can't help but think that at least half or even more of those who voted  for this legislation would find themselves in that position. When we look at where we are today and see that there is something that can be done, I think it is necessary that we go ahead and do it. One of the things that is going on now--and this bothers me a little bit--is that there is an argument going on right now between some of the committees--the Finance Committee and the Banking Committee--as to who has jurisdiction. Then there is a debate as to whether a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the American people are concerned about this, concerned as I am and as many Members of this body are, that this was done without the consideration it should have had, this amount of money, $700 billion is out there now in the hands of one person to do with as he wishes, that is not good Government and it needs to be stopped. We can stop it by the passage of the legislation I introduced this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it will do only two things. It will preclude and freeze any further expenditure by the Secretary of the Treasury and, second, it would preclude the second $350 billion from coming up for consideration. In other words, that would stay in the Treasury. I think this is the only chance we have to get it done. We better do it now or it is going to be too late and we will be out of here and it will be history by the time we come back at the end of January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that happy note, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.</chair>
