  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Rodriguez) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to stand here today and report to the American people that we have completed the 100-hours agenda. We are demonstrating that we have kept our promise. We have set a tone for the 110th Congress that is one of cooperation, consensus, and compromise that extends beyond party lines. From the ethics reforms to restoring fiscal responsibility, to strengthening our national security, to giving more Americans a realistic shot at the American Dream, the new  Democratic majority is committed to real and lasting results for the people that we serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the opening days of the Congress, January 4, we adopted the most sweeping ethics package since the post-Watergate era. We restored tough pay-as-you-go budget rules, which will begin to reverse the record budget deficits that are passing on trillions of dollars to our children and grandchildren. We all recognize how important that is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recognize that we are some $8.6 trillion in debt, that each one now owes over $29,000. In fact, every child born now owes some $29,000 in order for us to pay the debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the remainder of the first 100 hours, we have turned to passing the Six for '06 agenda to meet the everyday needs of all Americans. We made America safer by the passage of a bill that implements the recommendation of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, which were submitted by Congress in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are extremely proud of that particular piece of legislation, because it allows us to address those needs that were identified by the commission, needs, especially, in south Texas, as we know, on border security, that are critical, other needs, such significant, although they might be considered not so important, but the importance of the agencies to be able to communicate with each other that was found to be one of the most difficult problems that we have still, but have not confronted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made our economy fair by passing a bill that increases the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over the next 2 years, affecting approximately 900,000 employees in Texas. Texas is hit the hardest with this, with the minimum wage; and we are extremely proud to have passed that piece of legislation. It also impacts some of 28.6 percent of the jobs that pay below the Federal poverty line in Texas. We have improved health care by passing and extending the Federal funding for lifesaving embryonic  stem cell research, which will help 110 million Americans suffering from diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have helped to make health care more affordable by passing a bill that directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct cost savings negotiations with the drug companies for lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries. That is essential. The way the legislation has been written is basically un-American, not allowing us to bargain with the pharmaceutical companies to get lower prices, very similar to what the VA does now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that they are able to get prices at 60 percent lower than what we can for our seniors under Medicare. This particular piece of legislation is going to be out there, and it is going to help all of us, and especially the taxpayer that has to pay for Medicare. So we are extremely proud to have passed that piece of legislation in the last 100 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also make college more affordable by passing a bill that cuts the interest rates on subsidized student loans for undergraduates in half over the next 5 years. This is particularly important, also, for Hispanic Americans, since 50 percent of Latinos, undergrads, receive Federal aid affecting some 205,000 students throughout this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are extremely proud to have done that. The interest rates on those loans for those students is essential, that we can lower them to a level where it has a direct impact on the cost of higher education. We also know that tuition has been increasing. No one knows that better than parents and young people that are going to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We set America on the path to energy independence by passing a bill that repeals $14 billion in subsidies to big oil and gas companies and invests those funds, instead, in clean, renewable energy resources and alternative fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just the beginning of the work we are going to be doing. I am really pleased.</paragraph>
