    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to recognize an extraordinary honor bestowed upon Horace P. Axtell, elder of the Nimiipu, more commonly known as the Nez Perce Tribe. Horace is a 2008 recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts, NEA, National Heritage Fellowship, an annual fellowship that honors American folk artists for contributions to American culture. The highest federal honor in the folk and traditional arts, only 10 NEA National Heritage Fellowships are awarded every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Horace is a Nez Perce tribal historian, storyteller, singer and drum maker. In fact, he is a spiritual leader of the Seven-Drum religion, a traditional religion of the tribes of the plateau region that requires practitioners to memorize songs and accompany them on handmade drums. He still builds these drums in the traditional way, curing hides and stretching them over wooden frames. Spending his youth listening to stories of the tribal elders, some of whom survived the 1877 war against the Nez  Perce by the United States, Horace is now a respected elder himself and a pipe carrier for his tribe, a position of great honor. He is the author of a memoir, the first one printed in over half a century by a Nez Perce elder. He has received numerous awards including the President's Medallion from the University of Idaho, an honorary doctorate from Lewis-Clark State College and the Washington State Historical Society Peace and Friendship Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an honor for me to publicly recognize the remarkable achievements of Horace P. Axtell.</paragraph>
