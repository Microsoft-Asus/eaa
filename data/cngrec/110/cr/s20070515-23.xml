  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor Thomas J. Dodd, the former Senator of the great State of Connecticut. As his son, my senior Senator, CHRIS DODD, said earlier, Thomas Dodd would have turned 100 years old today. He was a public servant of the highest order, working in an astounding number of capacities throughout his life. After graduating from Yale Law School, he became a special agent with the FBI, and eventually became an assistant for five Attorney Generals of the  United States. In this capacity, Thomas Dodd played a key role in establishing the first civil rights division of the Justice Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon leaving the Justice Department, Senator Dodd became the U.S. chief counsel to prosecute Axis crimes at Nuremberg and handled the day-to-day strategies for our Nation's prosecution team. In recognition of his work, Senator Dodd received a Presidential Citation, the U.S. Medal of Freedom, and the Czechoslovakian Order of the White Lion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admire Senator Dodd for his bravery at Nuremberg. It was not an easy job. He spent over a year away from his family, but he did it because he believed the United States had a responsibility to show the world its resounding dedication to a fair legal process and the delivery of justice to the Nazi war criminals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Dodd's political career began in 1952 when he was elected from the First District of Connecticut in the House of Representatives. He won election to the Senate in 1958, serving as a leader on the Foreign Relations Committee throughout his tenure. Senator Dodd wholeheartedly opposed Soviet communism, and often stood as a maverick within the Democratic Party on foreign policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas Dodd was an inspiration to me. He was a brilliant orator, and I would often find my way to see him speak when he would visit the New Haven area. He was a man who stood by his principles, oftentimes in the face of fierce opposition. Partisanship and politics always took a backseat to doing what was in the best interest of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thomas Dodd never refrained from asking the tough questions, and I applaud him for his independence and the example he set as a distinguished Senator from my home State of Connecticut, a proud legacy of public service, which his son Chris has carried on.</paragraph>
