  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="IN MEMORY OF HOWARD HOLTAN">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on September 22, 2007, lifelong Alaskan Howard Holtan died when his plane crashed during takeoff near Whittier, AK. Howard not only was a personal friend of mine but also to the hundreds of Alaskan children he coached through the Alyeska Mighty Mites, a volunteer-operated ski racing program for children. Under Howard's guidance, my two sons developed their skills and a passion for ski racing while my husband and I volunteered as Mighty Mites parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Howard began coaching skiing in 1971. He was the magic and the muscle behind the Mighty Mites, running the program almost singlehandedly from his personal laptop since the mid-1980s when he became the Mighty Mites director. Howard strove to introduce the fundamentals and joy of alpine ski racing to children of all abilities, while also giving kids self-confidence, a sense of accomplishment, and an appreciation for good sportsmanship. Howard ensured that lots of fun was had by all. There is no  doubt that he helped make the Mighty Mites one of the most successful youth ski programs in America. In fact, Olympians Megan Gerety and Rosey Fletcher and former U.S. Ski Team members Mike Makar and Kjersti Bjorn-Roli started out as young Mighty Mites. For the ski community, it will be hard to imagine a Mighty Mites ski race without Howard's trademark "cherub" smile or his presence somewhere on the hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Howard's passion for downhill skiing and dedication to Alaska's youth was almost matched by his commitment to public service--he spent 16 years working for the municipality of Anchorage, and was promoted to director of project management and engineering 8 years ago. Howard's legacy is everywhere in Anchorage as he had a hand in most of the roads and major projects in the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Howard will be sorely missed by countless Alaskans. Not surprisingly, the Discovery Theatre at the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts overflowed with all those who came to celebrate and honor Howard's life. Howard is survived by his wife Roberta Carney; son Aaron Holtan and his wife, Carrie Holtan; daughter Kathryn Holtan, now at Washington State University; grandchildren, Erik and James; and brother Jay Holtan and his wife, Patricia O' Gorman. I would like to extend my condolences to his  family and friends, and I wish his wife Roberta, who was injured in the crash, a speedy recovery.</paragraph>
