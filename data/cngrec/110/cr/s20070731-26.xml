  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to honor Dr. W. Ron DeHaven, Administrator of the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, and to congratulate him on his retirement from public service. Dr. DeHaven has served the agency for 28 years during which he has contributed greatly to the agency's mission of promoting and protecting U.S. agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. DeHaven began his APHIS career working in a field office for the veterinary services program in 1979. He later joined the agency's animal care program, rising to the top position in 1996. From 2001 to 2002 he served as the APHIS acting associate administrator, and in 2002, became head of the agency's veterinary services program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Nation's chief veterinarian, he played a leading role as the agency faced the first U.S. detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, in 2003. His handling of this situation--as well as other animal health emergencies--showcased his trademark straightforward leadership style and calm demeanor. These challenges prepared him well for the role of APHIS Administrator, which he assumed in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Administrator, he has skillfully guided his agency and communicated with the public, Congress, and USDA's many stakeholders. He worked conscientiously to position APHIS to prevent and respond to such threats as highly pathogenic avian influenza, exotic Newcastle disease, sudden oak death, Asian longhorned beetle and citrus diseases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. DeHaven's dedication, work ethic, and personal commitment to excellence have served U.S. agriculture well and ensured a healthy and abundant food supply for U.S consumers.</paragraph>
