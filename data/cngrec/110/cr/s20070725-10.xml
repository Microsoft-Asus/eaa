  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JASON LEE BISHOP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, most of the men and women who wear our country's uniform would not call themselves heroes, but I am afraid I would have to disagree with that. Those who fight abroad for our freedom here at home are, indeed, heroes. I rise to honor one special Kentuckian among them who was lost to us in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SFC Jason Lee Bishop of Covington, KY, was killed by a car bomb while on patrol operations in Siniya, Iraq, on New Year's Day of 2006. A member of the 1st Squadron, 33rd Cavalry, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, KY, he was 31 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his outstanding service as a soldier in the U.S. Army, SFC Bishop was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart, as well as many other medals and honors of distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason was the first of four children born to his parents Frank and Brenda Bishop in the northern Kentucky town of Covington. His mother remembers Jason as a young child standing on the seat in the family car and singing along with the radio, especially to Kenny Rogers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Riding in the car with his father was a different experience. Frank taught young Jason how to drive by putting him in the driver's seat at the top of a hill, disengaging the parking brake, and issuing one command: "Drive." On a stick shift, no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason and his dad enjoyed deer hunting and fishing together, something they did whenever the opportunity arose. Playing cards was another way the two enjoyed each other's company. His family says Jason learned to count using playing cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason graduated from Covington Holmes High School in 1993 with 4 years of junior ROTC experience. He entered the Army immediately upon graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After basic training and assignment at Fort Knox, also in my State of Kentucky, Jason was sent to the Republic of Korea. He also was deployed to Bosnia for a 10-month tour. Later assigned to Fort Campbell back in Kentucky, Jason was promoted to sergeant first class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Completing Drill Sergeant School was one of SFC Bishop's proudest accomplishments. Earning that drill sergeant badge was physically and mentally grueling, perhaps the toughest of all of his assignments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason became a darn good drill sergeant. A fellow drill sergeant who served with him at Fort Knox, SFC Daniel Webster, says he is not aware of any combat deaths among the 1,000 men Jason trained at Fort Knox--a remarkable record. "There is no doubt in my mind soldiers are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan alive because Jason was so committed to their training," SFC Webster added.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In July of 1999, while stationed at Fort Knox, Jason met the woman he would marry, Katrina Bishop. They took their vows in 2002. "He and I were soulmates," Katrina says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They had a son, Matthew Franklin Bishop. Only 1 1/2  years old when Jason deployed for the last time, he idolized his father. Matt "quickly became his shadow," Katrina says. "Wherever Daddy was, Matt had to be too."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September 2005, Jason and his unit deployed to Iraq. They would come home without him in September of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jason is loved and remembered by his parents Frank and Brenda Bishop; his sisters Jamie, Lacey, and Julia Bishop; his wife Katrina Bishop; his son Matthew Bishop; his daughter Morgan Bishop, as well as many other beloved family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A wall that stands at Fort Knox to honor all of the fallen heroes in Iraq and Afghanistan has been named for the soldier who once served there. It is called "Bishop's Wall of Remembrance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is also a Sergeant First Class Jason Bishop Memorial Park at Covington that sits directly across from the house in which Jason grew up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the tribute to Sergeant First Class Bishop I can speak to most is this medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This medal, this coin was sent to me by Katrina Bishop. The Bishop family had it made in honor of their son. On one side it lists Jason's dates of birth and death, his assignment in the 101st Airborne Division, and his service in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other side of the coin it reads: "Sergeant First Class Jason Lee Bishop" and has a picture of his sergeant's stripes. It also lists seven attributes that the Bishop family chose to remember their son, husband, and father by: loyalty, honor, duty, integrity, respect, selfless service, personal courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this medal is the Bishop family's reminder of Jason's life, which was tragically ended, and of their love for him, which will never end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Katrina Bishop for this gift, and I will be honored to keep it in my office. It will serve as a reminder to me, as well, of how much we owe the men and women of our Armed Forces whose highest calling is to fight for the freedom of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to pause for a moment today and hold the family and friends of SFC Jason Lee Bishop in their prayers. They certainly will be in mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Arizona is recognized.</chair>
