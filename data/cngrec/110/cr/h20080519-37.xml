  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas a national transportation system conducive to bicycling produces enriched health, reduced traffic congestion and air pollution, economic vitality, and an overall improved quality of living is valuable for the Nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas by dramatically increasing levels of bicycling in United States cities tangible and intangible benefits to the quality of life for cities and towns across the country will be realized;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas we now live in a Nation with 300 million people, and that number is expected to grow to 365 million by 2030 and to 420 million by 2050 with the vast majority of that growth occurring in urban areas with limited ability to accommodate increased motor vehicle travel;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas since 1980, the number of miles Americans drive has grown 3 times faster than the United States population, and almost twice as fast as vehicle registrations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas one-third of the current population does not drive due to age, disability, ineligibility, economic circumstances, or personal choice;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States is challenged by an obesity epidemic, 65 percent of United States adults are either overweight or obese, and 13 percent of children and adolescents are overweight, due in large part to a lack of regular activity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Center for Disease Control estimates that if all physically inactive Americans became active, we would save $77 billion in annual medical costs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas over 753 of our Nation's Mayors have signed onto the climate protection agreement of the United States Conference of Mayors urging the Federal Government to enact policies and programs to meet or exceed a greenhouse gas emission reduction target of a 7 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2012;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the transportation sector contributes one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and passenger automobiles and light trucks alone contribute 21 percent;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas bicycle commuters annually save on average $1,825 in auto-related costs, reduce their carbon emissions by 128 pounds, conserve 145 gallons of gasoline, and avoid 50 hours of gridlock traffic;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the greatest potential for increased bicycle usage is in our major urban areas where 40 percent of trips are 2 miles or less and 28 percent are less than one mile;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in 1969 approximately 50 percent of children in the United States got to school by walking or bicycling, but in 2001 only 15 percent of students were walking or bicycling to school;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas as much as 20 to 30 percent of morning traffic is often generated by parents driving their children to schools, and in the United States, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children ages 3 to 14;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas many public agencies in cities are using bicycles to deliver critical municipal services, for example, more than 80 percent of police departments serving populations of 50,000 to 249,999 and 96 percent of those serving more than 250,000 residents now have routine patrols by bicycle;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas surveys show that a majority of people want to ride and walk more but are dissuaded by concern over traffic danger and other barriers, and case studies have shown that when those barriers to bicycling are removed, people start riding;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas investment used for improvements for bicyclists and promoting bicycle use resulted in the quadrupling of bicycle use in Portland, Oregon, since 1994 and a recent report to Congress on the nonmotorized transportation pilot program reveals that 19.6 percent of trips in Minneapolis, Minnesota, are made by biking and walking, reflecting the benefit of initial investments in nonmotorized infrastructure;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the American bicyclist generates enormous economic returns, in 2006, the national bicycling economy contributed $133 billion to the United States economy, supported nearly 1.1 million jobs across the United States, generated $17.7 billion in annual Federal and State tax revenue, produced $53.1 billion annually in retail sales and services, and provided sustainable growth in rural communities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a national network of interconnected urban and rural bikeways can provide valuable community benefits, including low or no-cost recreation and alternative transportation options for people of all ages and abilities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas mountain biking is an environmentally friendly, healthy nonmotorized outdoor recreation activity that encourages young people to experience our natural world, and engenders community support for preservation of open space;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas each year major charity bike rides in communities across the country raise in excess of $100 million for critical medical research to find cures for life-threatening diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 57 million adults in the United States bicycle each year, and bicycling and walking currently account for nearly 10 percent of trips and 13 percent of traffic fatalities, yet less than 2 percent of Federal transportation safety funding is currently spent to make bicycling and walking safer; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas communities across the United States are seeking ways to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, increase the safety of their neighborhoods, and decrease petroleum dependence, bicycles offer a simple, healthy, energy-saving alternative to driving: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That the Congress--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes that increased and safe bicycle use for transportation and recreation is in the national interest;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) supports policies that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) establish national target levels for increased bicycle use, reduce the number of motor vehicle miles traveled (VMT), improve  bicycle safety to be achieved within a specific timeframe, and collect data needed to monitor progress;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) increase intermodal travel between public transportation and bicycles;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) provide incentives for State and local governments to adopt and implement complete street policies designed to accommodate all users, including motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and people of all ages and abilities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) encourage bicycle use in communities where significant segments of the population do not drive and where short trips are most common;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) expand funding for core Federal transportation programs that support non-motorized infrastructure, education, and encouragement programs by--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) safeguarding existing funding sources for nonmotorized transportation from inequitable treatment in the Federal transportation funds rescission process;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) supporting funding for core Federal transportation programs that support nonmotorized travel, including transportation enhancements, safe routes to school, and recreational trails; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iii) ensuring that highway safety improvement program funds are spent in proportion to the percentage of bicyclist and pedestrian fatalities in each State;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) facilitate the development of a coordinated system of United States bicycle routes across the country that cross state borders and connect metropolitan regions;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (G) create bicycle-friendly Federal land protection legislation, such as national recreation areas, to encourage regulations and management practices for mountain biking as an environmentally friendly nonmotorized use of natural surface trails;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (H) provide flexibility in Federal transportation law that would speed up the delivery of nonmotorized infrastructure without sacrificing necessary environmental protections;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (I) provide Federal tax or funding incentives to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) States that adopt motor vehicle laws that protect the rights of bicyclists to share the road;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) businesses that expand bicycle-friendly programs for their employees;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iii) the health care industry to develop more member discount programs, that target increased physical activity such as bicycling and walking; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iv) provide bicycle commuters the transportation fringe benefits currently provided to people who commute by car or mass transit; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (J) build upon the "Green the Capitol Initiative" as a model, create and provide an environmentally sustainable and healthy working environment for employees that includes the promotion of bicycling as a transportation alternative;</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) encourages the Department of Transportation to provide leadership and coordination by reestablishing the Federal bicycle task force to include representatives from all relevant Federal agencies.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks, and to include extraneous material on <bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill>.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Hawaii?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill>, a resolution that recognizes the important role bicycling plays in both recreation and transportation. I thank Representative EARL BLUMENAUER, an avid cyclist, for bringing this measure to the floor. May has been designated as National Bike Month, making it an appropriate time to consider this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cycling is a healthy, environmentally friendly activity and mode of transportation. At a time when our Nation is facing a growing obesity epidemic and the challenges of global climate change, we in Congress should be making every effort to encourage and accommodate cyclists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill> expresses the support of the Congress for a number of commonsense approaches to increase bicycling and to protect cyclists, including setting goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled, or VMT, and to increase the safety of cyclists, spending highway safety funds proportionately to the percentage of cyclist and pedestrian deaths, implementing "complete streets" policies that take into account the needs of all users when designing a road, streamlining nonmotorized transportation  project delivery while upholding environmental standards, creating bicycle-friendly Federal lands and developing a national bike route system, continuing and strengthening Federal programs that support nonmotorized transportation and increasing intermodalism, building on the Green the Capitol initiative, which includes a bike sharing program and sets an example for employers to be bicycle friendly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, the U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT, delivered the National Bicycling and Walking Study to Congress, which created a now-defunct interagency task force to coordinate bicycling and walking safety and mobility efforts across Federal agencies. This resolution encourages DOT to reestablish this task force with representatives from all appropriate Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill> gives us a foundation to use as we consider the role cycling will play in the upcoming surface transportation authorization, and lays out a number of thoughtful approaches to increase bicycling and keep cyclists safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank, again, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for introducing this resolution, and urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 305, introduced by our colleague, Earl Blumenauer from Oregon. The resolution expresses the importance of bicycles in our transportation system. Bicycles provide a way to reduce congestion on our highways, decrease air pollution and enrich the health of Americans who use them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution supports the implementation of State and local street policies that accommodate all users of transportation, and supports funding for core Federal transportation programs that support nonmotorized infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With rising fuel prices, bicycling offers a way for Americans to save money and time on our busy highways, while maintaining and improving their fitness. I hope this concurrent resolution will bring attention to the many benefits of bicycling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support passage of the resolution, and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill>. <bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill> recognizes the important role bicycling plays in both transportation and recreation, and is an appropriate resolution to consider in May, which has been designated as National Bike Month. This resolution expresses the support of the Congress for a number of policies that would encourage cycling and advance our intermodal transportation network. I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for  introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our transportation choices can play a key role in solving the serious problems of worsening congestion and air quality, the obesity epidemic that afflicts millions of children and adults, and the threat of global climate change. To achieve these solutions, our transportation planning must be refocused to accommodate users of environmentally-friendly and healthy modes of transportation such as cycling. My experience has taught me that people want to get out of their cars; they want to lead active  and healthy lifestyles; and they want to do their part to protect our environment. By providing the appropriate infrastructure, we can give people the option to make smart travel choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill> expresses the support of the Congress for a number of common sense approaches to increase bicycling and to protect cyclists, including:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Setting goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled, VMT, to increase the safety of cyclists, and encouraging and allowing people to bicycle for short trips;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spending highway safety funds proportionally to the percentage of cyclist and pedestrian deaths;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Implementing "complete streets" policies that take into account the needs of all users when designing a road;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing flexibility for nonmotorized transportation project delivery while upholding environmental standards;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating bicycle-friendly Federal lands and developing a national bike route system;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing and strengthening Federal programs that support nonmotorized transportation and increasing intermodalism; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Building upon the "Greening the Capitol" initiative, which includes a bike sharing program  and sets an example for employers to be bicycle-friendly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, the U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT, issued the National Bicycling and Walking Study, establishing a national goal of doubling the percentage of trips made by foot and bicycle while simultaneously reducing crashes involving the two modes by ten percent. It also created a now-defunct interagency task force to coordinate these efforts across Federal agencies. This resolution encourages DOT to re-establish this task force with representatives from all appropriate Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="305">H. Con. Res. 305</bill> provides a framework for some of the choices that the Congress will need to make in the upcoming surface transportation authorization legislation. The Federal Government has a long history of visionary leadership in the transportation field, and we need to again show the leadership necessary to encourage mode shift, reduce congestion, and create a cleaner and healthier society. We must work to build a transportation system that enhances our quality of life and gives users modal  choice, and bicycle infrastructure needs to be a part of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.</paragraph>
