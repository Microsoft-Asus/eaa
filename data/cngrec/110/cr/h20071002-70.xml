  <narrative>LET'S GET SERIOUS ABOUT OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11130]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last Tuesday Congressman JIM COOPER and I reintroduced the SAFE Commission Act, and I'm hopeful that by joining efforts our colleagues in the House and the Senate will embrace this bipartisan commission that could put our country on sound financial footing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, the Heritage Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget all support the Cooper-Wolf SAFE Commission Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These groups also have joined on what they call "The Fiscal Wake-Up Tour," which has been traveling across  America from San Francisco to Cincinnati laying out the facts about the future financial condition of our country, discussing possible options and preparing the way for tough choices that those of us in Congress are going to have to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at this tour, you see groups who usually disagree more than they agree on policy issues. That makes it even more extraordinary that they all agree that we need to sit down and work together to make sure our country doesn't fall into a financial canyon that we can never climb out of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the message that is resonating with folks who hear them: the need to come together and work to find bipartisan answers to ensure a secure financial future for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the tour has told us, too, is that we shouldn't underestimate the willingness and ability of the American people to hear the truth and support the decisions necessary to change our financial course, and that's encouraging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of you may recall the Simon and Garfunkel song, "The Boxer," with the refrain, "Man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest." The Fiscal Wake-Up Tour offers hope that with education Americans may be more ready than we think to accept the fact that Federal spending cannot continue to balloon without consequences. It is time that we tell the American people what they need to hear and not just what they want to hear. "The Boxer" song, "Man hears what he wants to hear and  disregards the rest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty years from now we won't be arguing in Congress over discretionary spending anymore because there will be no funding left in that category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm not an expert in economics, but simple math tells us that little money will be left to ensure that our highways and bridges are safe, that there will be no money for cancer research and to solve the riddles of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, that there won't be money to care for veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Resources will be scarce to ensure our schools are the best in the world so that our children and grandchildren can get the necessary tools, particularly in math and science, to compete in the world marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe it to our young people to start the process today. Reining in spending is both an economic and it is a moral issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot continue to avoid our responsibility to future generations of Americans by passing on a broken system in the form of unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations and unsustainable spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot continue to borrow and mortgage our future to countries like China, which has a terrible human rights record and has plundered Tibet, and has Catholic bishops in jail and Protestant pastors in jail and others in jail, or the Saudi Arabia that is funding Wahabism around the world, that they carry obscene amounts of our debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I'm going to be candid. Congress, on its own, unfortunately can't get it done in this politically charged atmosphere of Washington today. The Congress today is dysfunctional. The latest public opinion polls perhaps validate my assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people expect us to put our partisan differences aside and to work together to get things done. We must move beyond the politics and come to grips with the fact that the financial future of our country is an American issue. It's not a red issue or blue issue. It's a red, white and blue issue. It's an issue that, as Americans, we should be working together to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the SAFE Commission process, Congress is the ultimate decisionmaker obviously, but it will be the SAFE Commission, after holding hearings across the country, listening to the American people and putting everything on the table for discussion, entitlements and tax policies, which will send its recommendations to Congress for a mandatory up-or-down vote, similar to what we do on the base closing commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress will be the major part in the SAFE process. It will be at the table. We even hold out hope that Congress could find its way and act on its own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, at least four of the 14 congressionally appointed commission members must be sitting Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, if Congress enacts significant legislation aimed at addressing this looming crisis, the SAFE commission would terminate and cease to exist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope this happens, but, quite frankly, I don't think it will. Abraham Lincoln once said: "You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there is a moral component to this issue that goes to the heart of who we are as Americans. By that I mean have we lost a national will to make the tough decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SAFE Commission offers us the opportunity to find a way forward to protect our future. Is it right for one generation to live very well knowing that its debts will be left to be paid for by their children and their grandchildren? No, it is not right, but it is immoral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm challenging our colleagues today to come together--to know that while you served in Congress you did everything in your power to provide the kind of security and way of life for your children and grandchildren that your parents and grandparents worked so hard to provide for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The challenge, too, goes out to the leadership in Congress and the Administration to make this a truly bipartisan effort and put the SAFE Commission on the fast track to enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How can we lack leadership on such a fundamental issue?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leadership by definition requires taking initiative--to act before others, to develop fresh approaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue is timely and critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to review the bipartisan Cooper-Wolf legislation.</paragraph>
