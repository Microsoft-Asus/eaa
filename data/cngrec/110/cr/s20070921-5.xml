  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the Defense Department authorization measure and conclude debate on the Levin-Reed amendment. Debate time until 9:50 this morning is equally divided and controlled between Senators LEVIN and MCCAIN. The two leaders will control the time between 9:50 and 10 a.m., with myself controlling the last 5 minutes, the vote occurring at 10 a.m. At 10 a.m., that will be the only vote to occur today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much appreciate the cooperation of all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, that we worked out our problems on Monday so that we can vote on the very long-standing issue. We should have done it, but we didn't, but I am glad we are doing it now--the WRDA bill. It is bipartisan; Senators BOXER and INHOFE worked on it very hard. We are going to finish this Monday night. There will be work done on the Defense authorization bill on Monday. People can come and offer amendments,  debate measures--whatever the managers feel is appropriate. Hopefully we can clear some amendments on that occasion.</paragraph>
