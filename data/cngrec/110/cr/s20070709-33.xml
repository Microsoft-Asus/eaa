  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="TRIBUTE TO RAY KUNTZ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the American adventurer, war hero, and 26th President of the United States Teddy Roosevelt once said, "Far away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing." And there is no work worth doing more than making sure our Nation's trucking industry runs smooth, and nobody works harder than my good friend Ray Kuntz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a fellow Montanan, Ray knows the value of hard work and has always been willing to roll up his sleeves and put in a full day. As the CEO of Watkins &amp; Shepard Trucking, which is based in my hometown of Helena, Ray has helped transform a small business into a thriving enterprise. With more than 700 trucks and drivers and 1,000 employees, Watkins &amp; Shepard has made their mark on the trucking industry. I remember attending the Watkins &amp; Shepard driving school, and I can say firsthand that it was  top notch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Ray will undertake a new challenge, taking the reins of the American Trucking Association as the chairman. Ray is no stranger to the ATA, and he is no stranger to success. As vice-chairman of the ATA, Ray helped to revolutionize the trucking industry. Combining cutting-edge technology and a passion for trucking, Ray helped to launch GetTrucking.com. This innovative Web site used humor, timely information, and eye-grabbing graphics to help recruit new drivers and keep trucking the vanguard  of America's transportation industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman, Ray will continue to use his drive, his creativity, and his passion to lead the ATA boldly into the 21st century. With his chairmanship, Ray has made the working folks the hallmark of his term. For those of us who know him, this is no surprise. Ray has always remembered his roots and the hard-working men and women he has served along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Ray at the helm, the ATA is on the path to an even more successful future as the voice of the men and women who are either behind the wheel, or behind the scenes, of the trucking industry.</paragraph>
