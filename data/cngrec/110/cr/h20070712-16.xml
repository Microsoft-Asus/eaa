  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 1992, I was proud to spearhead one of the first State initiatives to enable working families to purchase private health insurance for their children; 5 years later Congress passed the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, enabling every State to implement its own plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today 6 million American children have health coverage thanks to SCHIP. We in Congress are building upon the extraordinary success of SCHIP to extend it to almost 9 million American children who are now uninsured. The goal of insuring all American children is within our reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, instead of working with Congress to reach this goal, the President this week made it clear that health insurance for children is not important to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does the President really believe that America's children do not deserve quality ongoing health care? Does the President really believe that emergency rooms are the best place for primary care for children?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to just about every American that health insurance is expensive, and for too many American families, it is simply too expensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress recognizes the urgency of the situation, and we move ahead, unlike the President, to take this opportunity to cover every American child.</paragraph>
