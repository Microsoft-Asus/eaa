  <narrative>SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE -- (Senate - January 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="369">S369</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>We are going to try to get approved very quickly--we are cleared on this side; we are waiting to have the Republicans clear Governor Shafer to be the Secretary of Agriculture. We would like to get that done in the next little bit. After we do this, it takes the White House a number of hours to get all the paperwork in order so that he can be sworn in. It would be really nice if we could get him to attend the State of the Union Address tonight. This would be extremely good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has nominated him. This will be the last State of the Union speech the President will give, and it would be good if he had a Secretary of Agriculture there during those proceedings. So as soon as it is cleared by the Republicans, we will clear Governor Shafer to be the Secretary of Agriculture.</paragraph>
