    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the work of Bill Simmons, the director of the Yuba County Office of Education's Regional Career Center, and recognize Mr. Simmons' 21 years with the Yuba County Office of Education and commend his more than five decades of service to his country and his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1954, Bill Simmons began his 24-year career with the U.S. Air Force. He retired in 1977 as a first sergeant for the 9th Field Maintenance Squadron at Beale Air Force Base in Marysville, CA. After his retirement from the U.S. Air Force, Mr. Simmons remained in Marysville and began a long career of service to his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Simmons used the leadership skills he gained in the Air Force and began his career with Yuba County as a group counselor in the juvenile probation system. He remained committed to improving the community as he worked to help build the One-Stop Center, a invaluable resource for the region that is the service provider for the Federal Workforce Investment Act's One-Stop Center for Business and Workforce Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of working with Bill when he served on the Yuba County board of supervisors from 1997 to 2005, and we continue to collaborate on issues affecting Beale Air Force Base through Mr. Simmons' role as a member of the Beale Military Liaison Committee. For the last three decades, Bill Simmons has been a forceful advocate  for Beale AFB, by both working to improve the on-base facilities and promoting the many values and strengths of Beale AFB  throughout California and the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Simmons has been a valuable local resource on education, military, and local issues affecting the entire Yuba-Sutter region, and I hope that he will remain active in his community beyond his retirement from the Yuba County Office of Education. I wish my friend the best as he embarks on this latest chapter of his distinguished career.</paragraph>
