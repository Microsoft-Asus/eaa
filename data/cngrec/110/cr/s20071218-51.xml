    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to recognize a victory for the cause of justice, albeit one that is long overdue. In 1944, Booker Townsell, a private in the U.S. Army, was convicted of a crime in an unfair and racially biased trial, 63 years ago to this day. I join Booker Townsell's family in heralding the recent decision by the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to overturn this conviction and restore all rights lost as a result of the conviction. Although  Booker Townsell is no longer with us, and no ruling can change the injustice that Booker Townsell suffered when he was wrongly convicted by the Army in 1944, I am pleased to see that the Army is rejecting the original decision handed down 63 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the injustice he suffered, Booker Townsell displayed tremendous strength, and went on to lead a full life in Wisconsin, including raising a wonderful family. I am glad to see the tremendous weight of this conviction lifted from his family. It is due to their valiant effort that this decision was finally overturned. I also thank Congressmen JIM MCDERMOTT and DUNCAN HUNTER for putting vital pressure on the Army to review the 1944 decision. While it has taken far too long,  63 years later, justice has finally been restored to Booker Townsell and his family.</paragraph>
