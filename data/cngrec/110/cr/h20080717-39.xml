  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier today we saw a picture of the President of the United States with foreign dignitaries. We today see the Speaker of the House with a foreign dignitary. We do not begrudge either of them on this side of the aisle. We have to have responsible foreign relations. The only difference is we do not use pictures to explain America's energy policy or put forward conspiracy theories as to why you are feeling the pain at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us be realistic about this. We need more American oil production, commonsense conservation, and free market innovations. And no amount of political cant or hot air is going to do anything except keep your prices at the pump to the point where your family budget shrinks.</paragraph>
