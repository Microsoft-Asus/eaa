    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill deals with something that has developed. We would never dream we would be working on it, but it appears to be very important. We have had a lot of deaths and people getting sick, the popcorn workers in America, which is a huge industry. We are going to try to see if we can set some standards so people do not get sick by virtue of working around popcorn.</paragraph>
