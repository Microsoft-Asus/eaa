    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise to join my colleague AL GREEN of Texas in honoring the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, on its 98th anniversary. As we observe Black History Month this February, it is only appropriate that we recognize the Nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. Ninety-eight years after its inception, we salute the NAACP for its continued commitment to promoting equality and justice for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP has been at the forefront of every brave and courageous moment in this Nation's civil rights history. This was particularly evident during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1954 the NAACP secured one of the greatest legal victories with the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In 1960 the NAACP Youth Council organized a series of sit-ins at lunch counters throughout the country, an activity which I think for many of us, I know for myself, helped to pique and motivate our  interest in the ability of politics and movement to make change on behalf of people. And in 1965 the NAACP successfully sought enactment of the Voting Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the NAACP priorities continue to "ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons," as its mission statement reads. Last year the NAACP addressed such issues as voter disenfranchisement, HIV/AIDS, and the conflict in Sudan. In 2007 the organization continues to confront these and other domestic and international concerns. Most recently, the NAACP supported Congress' efforts to increase the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in this body congratulate the NAACP for this work and their continued efforts to protect the civil and human rights of our citizens. On its 98th anniversary, the NAACP remains an integral and essential part of this society. We salute the NAACP on this significant occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support House Concurrent Resolution 44, which recognizes the 98th anniversary of the NAACP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For almost a century, the NAACP has fought to bring justice and racial equality to all parts of America. In 1917 the NAACP won a legal victory in the Supreme Court which held that States could not restrict and officially segregate African Americans into residential areas. The same year the NAACP fought for the right for African Americans to be commissioned as officers in World War I. In 1920 the NAACP held its annual conference in Atlanta, which at the time was one of the most active areas for  the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, the NAACP showed the world it would not be intimidated by racial violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In 1935, NAACP lawyers Charles Houston and Thurgood Marshall won a legal battle to admit a black student to the University of Maryland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, the NAACP led the effort that resulted in President Franklin Roosevelt's ordering a non-discrimination policy in war-related industries and Federal employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in 1948, the NAACP convinced President Harry Truman to sign an executive order banning discrimination by the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1954, under the leadership of Special Counsel Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP won one of the greatest legal victories in Brown v. Board of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, members of the NAACP Youth Council launched a series of nonviolent sit-ins at segregated lunch counters. The segregation ended, and all Americans could finally break bread together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history of America's modern struggle to live up to our constitutional principles was often written by the NAACP, and it continues to champion the cause of social justice today. The NAACP has served as the voice of those who were mute with fear. It has served as a key for those who were handcuffed and jailed under segregationist policies. And it carried the weight for those whose backs were broken by brutal beatings. It did so peacefully, and with dignity; and, as a result, America can hold  its head higher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pleasure that I support this concurrent resolution, which I hope raises even higher the awareness of this organization's historic contributions to the cause of civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Issa), and would ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control said time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the sponsor of the resolution, the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400653" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, thanks to the subcommittee chairman, Congressman HOWARD BERMAN. I thank you much for the many things that you have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also think it appropriate to thank today chairman JOHN CONYERS of the Judiciary Committee for assisting in this and causing this piece of legislation to move forward quickly. I thank Senator HILLARY CLINTON and the more than 20 cosponsors in the United States Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My understanding is that companion legislation will be filed there today. We would like to thank the 117 cosponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives, all of whom believe that this legislation is exceedingly important. And, of course, I would like to thank last year's cosponsor with me, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Congressman JAMES SENSENBRENNER.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are many organizations that have endorsed this legislation: the American Jewish Committee; the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League; LULAC, the League of United Latin American Citizens; and NCLR, the National Council of La Raza.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, <bill type="hc" number="44">H. Con. Res. 44</bill> honors the NAACP for 98 years of service to America. Mr. Speaker, that is 98 years of upholding the constitutional notion of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. That is 98 years of standing on the Declaration of Independence and the premise that all persons are created equal; 98 years, Mr. Speaker, of saluting the proposition in the Pledge of Allegiance that we are indeed one Nation, with liberty and justice for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank God, Mr. Speaker, for the NAACP and those brave souls who assembled 98 years ago today on February 12, 1909, a group of people who met to fight for the rights of black people. They were an integrated group, both black and white, who believed in the Constitution of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while we must remember that the NAACP was founded to make democracy work for black people, we shouldn't forget that it was Mary White Ovington, a white woman, who is said to have hosted the founders meeting. And we shouldn't forget that she did this in response to William English Walling, a white man who wrote an article asking citizens to rally in support of African Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't forget in the NAACP, and we should never forget, the fact that this organization has never been a black-only organization. So, today, I salute the NAACP-ers, current and those who have gone on for their great work in this great country. I want to salute them by remembering those who are black, but I also pledge that we will never forget those who are white.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we remember Dr. Louis T. Wright, who in 1935 became the first black NAACP board Chair, we should not forget Oswald Garrison Villard, the white man who in 1911 became the very first Chair of the board of the NAACP. You see, there were two white NAACP board Chairs, Oswald Villard and Joel Spingarn, before we had a black NAACP board Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I believe we should remember James Weldon Johnson. He was the first black executive secretary and director of the NAACP. However, we should never forget Francis Blascon and Mary White Ovington, along with Mary Nurney and Royall Nash, all of whom were white and served before James Weldon Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us remember the brilliant lawyer and Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall. However, we should not forget Arthur Spingarn, the white NAACP-er who donated large sums of money and raised even more money for the NAACP Legal Redress Committee. While Thurgood Marshall was a great litigator, and he was, we should never forget that the Spingarns were great donators and made it possible for a lot of the litigation to take place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remember and I beg that we all remember Medgar Evers, the black NAACP field representative who was assassinated in his front yard in 1963. However, we shouldn't forget John R. Shillady, the white NAACP executive secretary, because he was beaten by a mob in Austin, Texas, and he never recovered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the efforts of a multiracial, religiously diverse and ethnically inclusive group, the NAACP has made great contributions to our society: the passage of the Voting Rights Act; the passage of the Civil Rights Act; the Fair Housing Act of 1968; filed and won many lawsuits, including Brown v. Board of Education; Shelley v. Kraemer; and recently contributed millions of dollars to assist the Hurricane Katrina victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today we can literally say we eat where we eat, we live where we live and we sleep where we sleep in part due to the NAACP, and we are grateful that they have been there for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I beg that all of my colleagues will support this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hc" number="44">H. Con. Res. 44</bill> is and should be about the NAACP, but it is also about a history of a struggle, not just the 98 years that the NAACP has been pushing and prodding this body, the courts and the executive branch for fairness for all people, all people in the United States, but for the history of this struggle. Whether it is the Marbury v. Madison decision, or the dreaded Dred Scott decision, the Court has had to be prodded by the public, the Congress has had to be prodded by the public,  and, yes, just as with Harry S. Truman, the President has had to be prodded by the public. No organization in American history has sustained the consistent legacy of being an effective prod to the government greater than the NAACP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I join with my colleagues on a bipartisan and undoubtedly bicameral  basis to celebrate this 98 years and the struggle that it represents.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise to congratulate the NAACP on its 98th Anniversary. As the Nation's oldest civil rights organization, the NAACP has for 98 years fought to ensure the political, educational, social and economic equality of all persons, so that all may share and participate in this country's great Democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP was founded by a multiracial group of activists who answered "The Call" for a national conference to discuss the civil and political rights of African Americans. This conference was in response to the race riots that took place in Springfield, Illinois in the summer of 1908. Since that time, the NAACP has sought to ensure equal rights for all citizens and to eliminate race prejudice in the United States by working to improve the democratic process and by seeking the enactment and  enforcement of laws that secure civil rights. The NAACP also acts as a watchdog and informs the public of the adverse effects of discrimination. The NAACP also educates the public about their constitutional rights, and when necessary, undertakes court cases to enforce and secure those rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP has a long and impressive history of activism and has contributed greatly to shaping America as we know it today. One of its first legislative initiatives was an anti-lynching campaign in the early 1900s. In the 1940s, the NAACP was influential in President Roosevelt's decision to issue an Executive Order prohibiting discrimination in contracts with the Department of Defense and in President Truman's decision to issue an Executive Order ending discrimination in the military. In the  1950s, the NAACP worked to bring an end to segregation in public schools; that work culminated in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. In the 1960s, the NAACP worked to raise support for the passage of the Civil Rights Act. In the 1970s, it helped expand voter participation through voter registration efforts. And the list goes on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the NAACP continues to eliminate race prejudice whenever it rears its ugly head. It continues to act as a watchdog to protect the civil rights of all people. And it educates the public about civil rights so that future generations will know tolerance and equality as the norm, rather than the exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a Diamond Life Member of the NAACP and to have served as a Branch President of the Newport News Chapter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the NAACP on 98 years of service to our great country and its people, and I wish them another successful 98 years.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on its 98th Anniversary. In 1909 the founder of the NAACP came together with the purpose of promoting the rights guaranteed under the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. Today, the NAACP works to ensure that all individuals have equal rights and to eradicate racial hatred and discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP has influenced some of the greatest civil rights victories of the last century, including: integration of schools and the Brown v. Board decision; the Voting Rights Act; striking down segregation; and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the advancements of the past 98 years under the leadership of the NAACP, there is still much work to be done. The NAACP continues to promote new ideas and leadership in the fields of educational and employment opportunities, ending health care disparities, and economic empowerment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP instilled in America a sense of consciousness, and continues to do that today through the thousands of individuals who continue to fight for equality and justice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as we celebrate the 98th anniversary of their inception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1909, the NAACP has been a leader in advancing civil rights and has sought to remove all barriers of racial discrimination through their use of legal and moral persuasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This organization has provided communities around the United States with strong and passionate leaders who have fought for social change. Among these organizations, it is an honor to note that California is home to 72 branches and youth units, each providing inspiration to their respective communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we celebrate the accomplishments of the NAACP, we must also honor the values upon which it was founded, for there is much work left to be done, and the same tireless dedication and clarity of purpose will be required to continue onward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for being champions of social justice and for their tireless efforts for almost a century. I look forward to celebrating their centennial in two years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="44">H. Con. Res. 44</bill>, which gives fitting honor and praise to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on the occasion of the 98th anniversary of its founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP is the oldest, largest, most historic and most influential civil rights organization in the United States. First organized in 1905, the group was known as the Niagara Movement when they began meeting at a hotel situated on the Canadian side of the Niagara Falls. They had to meet in Canada because American hotels in Niagara Falls were segregated. Under the leadership of the Harvard-educated scholar, the great W.E.B. DuBois, the group would later be known as the National Negro Committee  before finally adopting the name by which it has been known for the last 98 years--the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP--at its second conference in 1910.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first official meeting was held in 1909 exactly 98 years ago today: February 12, the centennial of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln. The mission of the association was clearly delineated in its charter:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To promote equality of rights and to eradicate caste or race prejudice among the citizens of the United States; to advance the interest of colored citizens; to secure for them impartial suffrage; and to increase their opportunities for securing justice in the courts, education for the children, employment according to their ability and complete equality before law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly a century, the NAACP has stayed true to its charter and championed the cause of justice and equality in America. It has fought valiantly and tirelessly on behalf of African Americans and others to secure their civil rights and liberties and the full measure of justice and equality for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when African Americans were treated as second-class citizens and the scourge of slavery was still rampant, the NAACP emerged to ensure that the rights, interests and voices of African Americans did not go unheard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair for the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am especially concerned with fair access to quality education for today's youth. I am personally grateful to the NAACP for its leadership in winning the greatest legal victory for civil rights in American history: the 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), in which the Supreme Court struck down de jure segregation in elementary schools. NAACP General Counsel Thurgood Marshall, who would  later become the first African American associate justice of the Supreme Court, forcefully argued and persuaded the Court to rule unanimously that in the field of public education, "separate but equal" was inherently unequal. That decision gave hope to millions of Americans that their children might enjoy the full promise of America that had been denied their forebears for more than three centuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP used the Supreme Court's decision in Brown to press for desegregation of schools and public facilities throughout the country. In 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested and fined for refusing to give up her seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama. Her act of civil disobedience triggered the Montgomery Bus Boycott, one of the largest and most successful mass movements against racial segregation in history and ignited the Civil Rights Movement. Daisy Bates spearheaded the campaign by the Little  Rock Nine to integrate Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NAACP remains committed to achieving its goals through nonviolence, the legal process, and moral and political suasion, and through direct actions such as marches, demonstrations, and boycotts to give voice to the hopes and aspirations of African Americans and others who lack the power to make their voices heard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is still a need for justice and equal treatment for African Americans and other vulnerable populations in our country. Thankfully, the NAACP is alive, well, vital, and effective. I am grateful for the many fights for equality that the organization has won, and thankful that the NAACP will be there in the future to champion the cause of justice wherever and whenever it needs a spokesman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Happy birthday, NAACP and thank you for all you have done to make our country better. I urge all Members to join me in supporting <bill type="hc" number="44">H. Con. Res. 44</bill>.</paragraph>
