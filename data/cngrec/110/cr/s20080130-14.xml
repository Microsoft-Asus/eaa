    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have three colleagues who want to join me in discussions of the FISA bill. I realize in morning business it is supposed to be 10 minutes. Since there are three different Members with whom I wish to have those discussions, I ask unanimous consent to be allotted 30 minutes to--this will be on the FISA bill, but since we are speaking in morning business, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized, with my colleagues, for 30 minutes.</paragraph>
