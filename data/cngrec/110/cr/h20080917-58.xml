  <narrative>The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hc" number="415">H. Con. Res. 415</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas throughout American history, alcohol has been consumed by its citizens and regulated by the Government;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas prior to the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which established Prohibition in the United States, abuses and insufficient regulation resulted in irresponsible overconsumption of alcohol;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas passage of the 18th Amendment, which prohibited "the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors" in the United States, resulted in a dramatic increase in illegal activity, including unsafe black market alcohol production, organized crime, and noncompliance with alcohol laws;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the platforms of the 2 major political parties in the 1932 presidential campaigns advocated ending national Prohibition by repealing the 18th Amendment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on February 20, 1933, the 2nd Session of the 72nd Congress submitted to conventions of the States the question of repealing the 18th Amendment and adding new language to the Constitution that the transportation or importation of alcoholic beverages for delivery or use in any State would have to be carried out in compliance with the laws of the State;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on December 3, 1933, Utah became the 36th State to approve what became the 21st Amendment to the Constitution, the quickest-ratified amendment and the only ever decided by State conventions, pursuant to article V of the Constitution;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas alcohol is the only product in commerce that has been the subject of 2 constitutional amendments;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas Congress's reenactment of the Webb-Kenyon Act, passage of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act, annual appropriations to support State enforcement of underage drinking laws, and the STOP Underage Drinking Act demonstrated the longstanding and continuing intent of Congress that States exercise their primary authority to achieve temperance, the creation and maintenance of orderly and stable markets, and the facilitation of the efficient collection of  taxes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas legislatures and alcoholic beverage control agencies in the 50 States have worked diligently to implement the powers granted by the 21st Amendment for 75 years;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas legislatures and alcoholic beverage control agencies in all States created and maintain State-based regulatory systems for alcohol distribution made up of producers and importers, wholesale distributors, and retailers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas development of a transparent and accountable system of distribution and sales, an orderly market, temperance in consumption and safe practices, the efficient collection of taxes, and other essential policies have been successfully guided by the collective experience and cooperation of government agencies and licensed industry members throughout our geographically and culturally diverse Nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas regulated commerce in alcoholic beverages contributes billions of dollars in Federal and State tax revenues and additional billions to the economy annually;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 2,500 breweries, distilleries, wineries, and import companies, 2,700 wholesale distributor facilities, over 530,000 retail outlets, and numerous agricultural, packaging, and transportation businesses support the employment of millions of Americans;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the American system of State-based alcohol regulation has resulted in a marketplace with unprecedented choice, variety, and selection for consumers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas members of the licensed alcoholic beverage industry have been constant partners with Federal and State Governments in balancing the conduct of competitive businesses with the need to control alcohol in order to provide American consumers with a safe and regulated supply of alcoholic beverages; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas members of the licensed alcoholic beverage industry have created and supported a wide range of national, State, and community programs to address problems associated with alcohol abuse, including drunk driving and underage drinking: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) celebrates 75 years of effective State-based alcohol regulation since the passage of the 21st Amendment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes State lawmakers, regulators, law enforcement officers, the public health community and industry members for creating a workable, legal, and successful system of alcoholic beverage regulation, distribution, and sale; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) continues to support policies that allow States to effectively regulate alcohol.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res 415, which celebrates 75 years of successful State-based alcohol regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) for introducing this measure. It's the same as H. Con. Res 341, introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak), which has 98 bipartisan cosponsors, and <bill type="sr" number="551">S. Res. 551</bill>, introduced by the senior Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, which has 14 cosponsors, also in a bipartisan manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventy-five years ago--nearly to the day--on December 5, 1933, the 21st amendment to the Constitution of this country was passed. It repealed prohibition, a great mistake in the social era in this country, and the 21st amendment was ratified by the people in constitutional form. It brought an end to a misguided experiment and ushered in a new system of legal regulation of alcohol beverages. Previously, we had an illegal system that encouraged organized crime and worked against the public's wishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 2 of that amendment states that "the transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors in violations of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited." The effect of section 2 was to entrust regulation of alcoholic beverages to the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the 21st amendment, and the terms of the Webb-Kenyon Act which implemented it, States have done an outstanding job exercising their primary authority to regulate this industry composed of producers, importers, wholesale distributors and retailers, often dubbed the "three tier system" by such knowledgeable and legendary individuals as Tom Hensley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been a successful approach, and we have not had occasion to reconsider it. It is a system that provides transparency and accountability. It is one that prizes public safety in which the industry works with State lawmakers--of which I was one for 24 years and served on the State and local government committee in Tennessee that had the responsibility of ensuring that the three-tier system worked and the public was protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public health officials and law enforcement people also worked on this to provide quality products to consumers and ensure the responsible use of alcoholic beverages. Through this partnership with the Federal Government, we have pursued efforts to eliminate alcohol abuse, underage drinking, drunk driving, and other problems associated with the abuse of alcoholic beverages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Mr. Stupak of Michigan and Mr. Coble of North Carolina for their leadership on this resolution, which commemorates the end of a failed experiment, prohibition, and the establishment of a system that served the citizens of this Nation well for over three-quarters of a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution is more symbolic than substantive. It will not  change the way the alcohol industry distributes their products, and it will not change the way States regulate alcohol distribution. But regrettably, it does celebrate the "successful system of alcoholic beverage regulation, distribution and sale."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My opposition is not a reflection on those who support this resolution; it is just that I am uneasy about Congress considering a resolution with this purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, the alcoholic beverage industry is a legitimate one. I have hardworking business owners in my district who create jobs and pay taxes. Most brewers, distributors and retailers try to ensure that alcohol is made, transported and sold in a safe and legal manner. However, the abuse of alcohol causes incalculable pain and suffering. It has cost thousands of lives, devastated families, and ruined the mental and physical health of many Americans. For the same reason, I would voice concerns  about a resolution celebrating the "successful distribution" of cigarettes and tobacco products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, alcohol ranks as a leading cause of death among young people age 10 to 24 due to motor vehicle crashes, unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide. Vehicle accidents have become the number one cause of death for teens in the U.S., over one-third are alcohol related.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And although States have passed laws to prevent individuals from driving while under the influence of alcohol, a huge number of alcohol-related deaths occur on roads across the Nation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that last year drunk driving killed almost 13,000 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do appreciate efforts of the alcoholic beverage industry, small businesses and distributors to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors. However, reports tell us that 33 percent of 12th graders still drink beer on at least a monthly basis and over 70 percent say that beer is easy to get.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Congress can attest that alcohol is no longer easily accessible to teens, that alcohol no longer contributes to 13,000 accident deaths each year, and that alcohol no longer devastates families and individuals, then a resolution celebrating the "successful distribution" of alcohol might be in order. Until then, I continue to have concerns with this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he might consume to my good friend and colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Coble).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas who serves very ably as our ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of H. Con. Res 415. This resolution celebrates the 75th anniversary of the end of Prohibition. Furthermore, it recognizes our effective regulation of alcohol by State and local governments and the dedication of our State lawmakers, regulators, law enforcement officers, the public health community, and industry members for creating a workable, legal and successful system of alcohol regulation, distribution and sale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prohibition, Mr. Speaker, began in 1919, when the 18th amendment was ratified. This led to a dramatic increase in illegal activity, including unsafe black market alcohol production, a growth in organized crime, and increasing noncompliance with alcohol laws. As a result, only 14 years later, on December 5, 1933, the 21st amendment was ratified, which repealed Prohibition and granted to the States control of alcohol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 21st amendment wisely established a State-based regulatory system for alcohol. This has permitted each State to adopt laws that reflect the views of its citizens. The result has been one of most comprehensive and community-sensitive alcohol regulatory programs in the world. Furthermore, it has created a safe and reliable marketplace for alcohol. Our consumers are free now from the threat of the harmful chemicals that were unknowingly consumed during the Prohibition Era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 75 years, local regulation has worked well. And while alcohol laws are continually tweaked and improved, adjusted and amended, our beer, liquor and wine providers have worked diligently together with regulators to ensure that public health and safety are first and foremost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many beer distributors who strongly support this resolution and recently concluded their national meeting in San Francisco play a vital role in their respective communities by sponsoring a vast array of programs that promote responsible consumption. The programs range from providing free taxi rides home for restaurant patrons who do not have a designated driver, to sponsoring alcohol-free after prom events and producing educational materials to assist parents in talking to their children about  underage drinking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Distributors also promote alcohol education initiatives that bring guest speakers into local schools and community centers. Some of these speakers who have made mistakes about alcohol, just as the distinguished gentleman from Texas mentioned earlier, became reckless and abandoned discretion and responsible drinking, but they have overcome those mistakes and have lived to retell their stories, and therefore, encourage others not to make the same mistakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The beer industry, Mr. Speaker, I'm sure in probably every district represented on this floor, creates innumerable job opportunities. The beer industry, furthermore, has spent nearly $700 million in communities across the country to fight and oppose drunk driving, underage drinking, and promote responsible consumption of alcohol through public safety, prevention and education campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the National Beer Wholesalers Association was instrumental in working with Congress to pass the STOP Underage Drinking bill, which was signed by President Bush in December of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are many alcohol vendors in my district in North Carolina who devote enormous amounts of time and money to improve the lives of people in our communities. They have openly supported community efforts for organizations such as United Cerebral Palsy, the Special Olympics, law enforcement, the Greensboro Children's Museum, the Greensboro Economic Development Partnership, the Rockwell Project for alcohol awareness at Greensboro area high schools, the Hospice of Greensboro, and  others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these vendors have also unanimously supported countless other efforts throughout the Sixth District of North Carolina. I'm sure many of you can duplicate that in your respective districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits vary from community to community. While there are sound reasons that alcohol should be regulated, it is clear to me that we should recognize and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of Prohibition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support <bill type="hc" number="415">H. Con. Res. 415</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas for having yielded to me.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate Mr. Coble's and Mr. Smith's comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Smith, of course, comes from a city in Texas that my predecessor, the Congressman from West Tennessee in the 1800s--Davy Crockett--went to. Unfortunately, it was the last city that Congressman Davy Crockett went to. I was noticing, in going through the Halls here, that Sam Houston, who left my State, went to be Governor of your State. So Texas and Tennessee have a lot in common. If it weren't for Tennessee, we probably wouldn't have a Texas, so it's wonderful to work with you today  on this particular resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I look around the Chamber here, there are great lawmakers, including Moses and Moses Maimonides. In Tennessee, we have a Bob Moses who had a lot to do with this three-tiered system, and he did a lot of work on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't have any further speakers. I'd like to inquire as to how many more speakers the gentleman from Texas might have.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400381" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before yielding back the balance of my time, I do want to thank my friend and colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Cohen, the gentleman from Tennessee, for those nice comments. He is right to point out the connections between Texas and Tennessee. Frankly, I  think they're a source of great interest and pride to residents of both States. I certainly appreciate his friendship. I appreciate the way he has conducted  this debate tonight as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on a personal matter, I will note that sometimes people see these bodies, and they think of our being acrimonious or not bipartisan. There is nobody I've enjoyed working with more than these two gentlemen on the Judiciary Committee, these Members on the other side of the aisle. We do work together a lot of times, and there is friendship, and there is work camaraderie and respect that people can probably recognize from some of the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that having been said, I would ask that we pass this resolution unanimously as introduced.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="415">H. Con. Res. 415</bill>, "Celebrating 75 years of effective State-based alcohol regulation and recognizing State lawmakers, regulators, law enforcement officers, the public health community and industry members for creating a workable, legal, and successful system of alcoholic beverage regulation, distribution, and sale."</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="415">H. Con. Res. 415</bill> celebrates a remarkable time in American history. It is worthy to remember how far the United States Government has come since its inception. With the ratification of the 21st Amendment, primary authority was delegated to the individual States, establishing the State-based regulatory system for alcohol distribution we still use today. The regulatory system has allowed each State to adopt individual laws that fit the beliefs of its citizens and still remains effective and in place  today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This State-based system created the safest and most responsible alcohol marketplace in the world. It not only protects consumers from tainted or counterfeit alcohol, but also provides transparency, accountability, and tremendous choice and value for American consumers for 75 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1919, following the passage of the 18th amendment, which prohibited "the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors," the United States experienced a dramatic increase in illegal activity including unsafe black market alcohol production, a growth in organized crime and increasing noncompliance with alcohol laws. By the end of the decade, Gangster Al Capone controlled all 10,000 speakeasies in Chicago and ruled the bootlegging business from Canada to Florida. Numerous other  crimes, including theft and murder, were directly linked to criminal activities in Chicago and elsewhere in violation of prohibition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many social problems have been attributed to the Prohibition era. A profitable and typically violent, black market for alcohol flourished during the Prohibition Era. Stronger liquor surged in popularity because its potency made it more profitable to smuggle. The cost of enforcing Prohibition was high, and the lack of tax revenues on alcohol (some $500 million annually nationwide) affected government coffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 21st amendment is significant because when repeal of Prohibition occurred in 1933, organized crime lost nearly all of its black market alcohol profits in most States because of competition with low-priced alcohol sales at legal liquor stores. The post-Prohibition period saw the introduction of the American lager style of beer, which dominates today, such as Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser and Coors Brewing Company. Alcohol has been and still is a part of the American tradition. In my great State  of Texas there are 75 breweries and eight of them are located in the city of Houston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us celebrate the Cullen-Harrison Act which Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law in 1933, which once again, legalized the sale of 3.2 percent beer, signaling the beginning of the end of the 13-year "failed experiment" known as Prohibition.</paragraph>
