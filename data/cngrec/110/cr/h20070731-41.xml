  <speaking speaker="400108" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for enacting the free trade agreements with our allies, democracies in Latin America like Colombia, Peru and Panama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed, frankly, that the Democratic leadership has broken the agreement they made with the administration in May to bring these vital trade agreements to the floor. We have not seen them yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enactment of these important agreements will strengthen the economies of our democratic allies in the region, as well as our own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a strong supporter of free trade with these free nations, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to enact free trade agreements this year and to hold the Democratic leadership's feet to the fire to make sure that they do not break their agreement that they entered into in May.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
