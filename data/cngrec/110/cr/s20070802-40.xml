    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate the Honolulu Bulls Soccer Club's Under-14 Division Girls Team for winning the Dana Cup No. 1 in Hjorring, Denmark. The Dana Cup is an international soccer tournament that takes place every summer and includes 300 girls and boys teams from 30 nations. The Under-14 Division Girls Team was one of 2 teams representing the United States out of 47 teams in that division. This was the first time a team from Hawaii has won this prestigious international tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to acknowledge the girls' skill, hard work, and dedication to soccer that led them to this unprecedented victory. They showed strength and agility as they went undefeated in eight matches without a single goal scored against them. A special congratulations goes to Malia Brennan, who received the Golden Boot Award as the top player in the girls Under-14 Division. I wish to also acknowledge her teammates on their success: Jayci Cabael, Kayla Cabael, Lauren Stollar, Brooke Lovelace, Kianna  Akazawa, Caprice Dydasco, Kadi Lee, Staci Mihara, Teisha Nacis, Sierra Nicols, Steffani Tanaka, Gabby Yates, McKenna Davidson, and Tracee Fukunaga. Their parents and families are recognized as well for their commitment, sacrifice, and support that helped shape and instill in them important values that led to their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These young women could not have gotten where they are today without the support and knowledge of the game passed down to them from their coaches, Rick Chong and Kerry Miike. I commend these two men on their dedication to teaching, nourishing, and raising our next generation of athletes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also congratulate everyone at the Honolulu Bulls Soccer Club for their commitment to educating and developing youth soccer players that strive to be competitive regionally, nationally, and internationally. I wish nothing but the best for the girls, their family, and coaches and wish them success in future endeavors.</paragraph>
