    <paragraph>In pursuit of meeting these goals, redoing E-verify, giving it a 5-year life, doing it the right way, doing those other things, as well as trying to help this small universe of American citizens, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of <bill type="s" number="3414">S. 3414</bill>, the Visa Efficiency and E-Verify Extension Act of 2008, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration and to the consideration of <bill type="h" number="5569">H.R. 5569</bill>, the E-V-5 extension, which was received  from the House, en bloc; further, that the bills be read a third time and passed, en bloc; and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc, with no intervening action or debate.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I note that we are talking about some sort of capture of unused visas in the past, which we calculate at about 550,000. Maybe it is 300,000. This is a major alteration of current law that has a certain number of family members, a large number, actually, who can come in every year. This would be a major expansion of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the kinds of things I think the Senate has gotten to the point we know we don't need to have a full debate on before we recess this year. Therefore, I consider that addition to the House bill that Senator Menendez wishes to see become law as a nonstarter and would have to object.</paragraph>

  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret my colleague's objection. At the end of the day, I understand how passionately he feels. I hope he understands how passionately I feel. The reality is I find it very difficult when my constituents, U.S. citizens, paying their taxes, being good citizens, come to me and say: We cannot get reunified with our spouse. We cannot get reunified with our mother and father. We cannot get reunified with our son and daughter. That is the universe we are talking about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we do not stand for the very core value of family reunification, while we talk about those who have money to invest and who get visas because they have money, well, we have seen what has happened with our system around here when everything is about money, and it is a huge failure. The proposition is that if you have money, yes, you can get a visa. But God forbid we give a U.S. citizen who is claiming their family a visa as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel very passionately about this. I understand Senator Sessions feels very passionately about the way he views it, and I hope we can reconcile our passions and be able to have a little less heat, a little more light, and create an opportunity to be able to move forward in the days ahead. We have time until the end of November, and I certainly look forward to working constructively to make that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
