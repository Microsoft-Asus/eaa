  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DR. ANDREW MAYS -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14615">S14615</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I want to commend a distinguished resident of the State of Alabama, Dr. Andrew Mays. Dr. Mays lives in Birmingham, AL. He is a well-respected member of the medical community in our State, serving as a faculty member in the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine's Department of Ophthalmology, as well as operating a private clinical practice. He serves our State public education and health systems at the Callahan Eye Foundation Hospital, where  he concentrates his research and practice in combating the devastating effects of the eye disease glaucoma. Dr. Mays also sits on the Board of Directors for the Alabama Academy of Ophthalmology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I speak to you today not to praise Dr. Mays for his accomplishments in medicine, but to congratulate  him on being awarded the first prize in the 2007 Van Cliburn International Competition for Outstanding Amateurs. Dr. Mays beat 74 other contestants on June 3, 2007, to earn this mark of distinction. This competition lasts a week, and allows competitors over the age of 35 who do not earn their livelihood through playing or providing instruction  on the piano to vie for a chance to win this distinguished title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael Huebner of the Birmingham News once stated that Dr. Mays possessed "a heart and mind of extraordinary capacity." Drew Mays possesses wonderful talent. He polished and sharpened this talent at the School of Music at the University of Alabama, earning both a Bachelor of Music in 1982, summa cum laude honors included, and a Master of Music degree in 1987 from this fine institution. In addition, he earned the opportunities to study at the Conservatory of Music in Hanover, Germany, and the  Manhattan School of Music in New York City, where he began his Master studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only has Dr. Mays made a name for himself through medicine and music, he is a man dedicated to family values. He and his wife, Dr. Therese Mays, have four young children. Dr. Mays had his family by his side as he won the Van Cliburn competition this year. I had the pleasure of meeting him and his wife when they came to visit my office during a trip to play at George Washington University through a Smithsonian Associates program. During the recital he gave at the Jack Morton Auditorium on  the GWU campus, you could see the bond these two shared as musicians and partners, as his wife nodded along to the twists, turns, and rhythms of his performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Dr. Andrew Mays for all of his accomplishments and successes, and I am proud to be able to represent such a wonderful man. I share with this body today my pleasure in congratulating Dr. Mays for winning this prestigious competition, as he is certainly a worthy recipient.</paragraph>
