    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will begin a period of morning business until 1 p.m., with the first hour under the control of the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, the second hour under the control of the Republicans, and the final hour equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 1 p.m., we will resume consideration of the ethics legislation. Cloture was filed on amendment No. 4, the so-called corporate jets amendment. Cloture was also filed on the substitute amendment and the bill. First-degree amendments need to be filed at the desk by 10:30 this morning, and any second-degree amendments should be filed by 4:30 p.m. today. There will be three votes starting at 5:30 today: the Durbin second-degree amendment regarding earmarks; the DeMint first-degree amendment regarding  earmarks, as amended, if amended; and then the cloture vote on Reid amendment No. 4. Members should plan their schedules accordingly and remember that rollcall votes are 15 minutes, with a 5-minute grace period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to finish this legislation this week. If we finish it Thursday, we will be through Thursday. If the Republican leader agrees, we will finish it Thursday; otherwise, we will push on until we finish this legislation. I hope we can do it Thursday or Friday, but if we have to be here over the weekend, we are going to do it. We are going to finish this legislation. If cloture is not invoked, we will make a decision at that time as to what we will do with the legislation. We have made  a lot of progress. There are still a lot of amendments out there floating around, and we will have to see what the body wants to do with those. That will be determined tonight with the cloture votes.</paragraph>
