    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring to the country's attention something devastating that is happening in northeast Wisconsin. Our paper industry, the very industry that grew the jobs and grew the future of northeast Wisconsin, is being devastated because of unbalanced and unfair trade with Communist China, who continues to export illegal paper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, a corporation called New Page closed the Kimberly Mill. You've heard of Kimberly-Clark and Kleenex. Well, Kimberly has had a mill since the 1890s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to present every morning and every evening the stories of real people and their real damages. And one of the families is Don Wendel and his wife, Ann, with their two children, Kathleen and Anthony. He worked there for 30 years. "Our daughter is a junior in high school, and the thought of paying for college with this uncertain future is daunting. We may have to sell our car we bought in March. It is shocking and disheartening that the owners, instead of researching options to make  this mill profitable, made a quick decision to shut it down. It's causing such great devastation for everyone in Kimberly and throughout the Fox Valley in northeast Wisconsin."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's time we had balanced trade deals, not free trade.</paragraph>
