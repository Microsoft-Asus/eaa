    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a week ago Friday, the market dropped 400-plus points, and the Air Force announced its award of a refueling aircraft contract to foreign-based Airbus over U.S.-based Boeing. At a time when we are working on national economic stimulus plans for our sagging economy, outsourcing vital defense work and good-paying jobs raises questions that are both troubling and alarming. Their decision to reward foreign interests by spending $40 billion abroad has been ridiculed. Many  today are still shaking their heads. It reminds me of a time not long ago when we were being asked to relinquish control of our ports. This latest debacle doesn't make sense, and it is not good for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Air Force officials have agreed to move up a debriefing with Boeing officials to explain why they would outsource the construction of 179 aerial tankers abroad. Adding insult to injury, many believe the Air Force decision will end up actually buying a more costly and less capable aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members are disturbed by what has transpired as a result of this deal. It degrades our national defense industry. It diminishes economic development opportunities and jobs here at home. When will we insist on putting America's interests first? This Congress should act swiftly and responsibly to review and to stop this questionable contract award.</paragraph>
