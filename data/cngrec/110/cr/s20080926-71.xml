    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Kenny Perry and J.B. Holmes for their contribution to the success of the 2008 United States Ryder Cup team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2008 Ryder Cup was recently held in my home State at the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, KY. On Sunday, the American team defeated the Europeans 16 1/2  to 11 1/2 . This was their first Ryder Cup victory since 1999. If not for the remarkable performances by Mr. Perry and Mr. Holmes, this success would not have been possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Perry was born in Elizabethtown, KY, but calls Franklin, KY, his home. He started playing golf at the age of 7 and spent years perfecting his game. He later went on to attend Western Kentucky University and started golfing professionally in 1982. He has shown his dedication to the game of golf by building a public golf course in his hometown specifically designed for handicapped individuals. Perry's performance at this year's Ryder Cup was exceptional as he finished with a total record of  two wins, one loss, and one tie. His achievements on and off the course are to be commended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Holmes was born and currently resides in Campbellsville, KY. He has played golf most of his life, including playing for his local high school golf team as a third grade elementary student. He later went on to attend the University of Kentucky and started playing professional golf in 2005. His hard work and dedication have earned him the right to be named among the highest skilled golfers in the world. Mr. Holmes' performance at the 2008 Ryder Cup was one of the best. He finished with a total  score of two wins, no losses, and one tie. It was a pleasure to watch Mr. Holmes compete and I congratulate him on an outstanding performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Perry and Mr. Holmes for their remarkable performance and achievement. These two men have represented Kentucky and the United States well.</paragraph>
