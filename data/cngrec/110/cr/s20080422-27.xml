  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="RETIREMENT OF DWIGHT WHITTAKER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I am proud to honor an Idahoan who has devoted his adult life to helping the disabled, and the past 37 years, doing this by leading the Development Workshop Incorporated, DWI, the largest community rehabilitation program in Idaho. DWI provides work and life skills and job training to those with disabilities, and helps them move into gainful employment. When Dwight founded DWI in 1971, it served 12 individuals; now, it's grown to a company that serves 700 to 800  people with locations in five eastern Idaho counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dwight's steady leadership, renowned courtesy and high integrity led DWI to success and earned him the Milton "Milt" Cohen Leadership Award from the National Industries for the Severely Handicapped in 2006. Dwight led efforts over the years to preserve funding and promote legislation at both the State and national level for individuals with disabilities. In his position, he has consistently sought out commonsense solutions to service and funding challenges and has surely been most rewarded  by seeing DWI grow into an organization of such esteem and reputation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The face of community rehabilitation in southeast Idaho has undergone a significant transformation over the past four decades, and the citizens of Idaho Falls and the surrounding areas have Dwight to thank. I wish him well in his retirement and am certain that he will bring the same gifts of leadership, comity and energy to whatever path he chooses to walk next.</paragraph>
