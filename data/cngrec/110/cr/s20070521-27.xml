    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize Charles Wofford. Mr. Wofford is retiring from the position of Alabama area director of the Social Security Administration after over 45 years of dedicated service. He has served as the Area Director in Alabama since September 1979.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Wofford graduated from the University of Alabama in 1961 with a B.S. degree in biology. He began work with Social Security that same year as a claims representative trainee. He held additional increasingly responsible jobs as a claims authorizer, field representative, operations supervisor, branch manager, assistant district manager, district manager, and has been an area director since April 1977 and came to Alabama in 1979 to serve as the Alabama area director at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is the senior area director in the United States, and has received numerous awards throughout his career for superior performance. He received a service award for spearheading an intense direct deposit campaign and a cash award in recognition of exemplary achievement in the area of DDS and field office relations. He has strived to build a strong management team and has worked to ensure that all employees are fully trained to perform to the best of their ability. He received the Deputy Commissioner's  Citation for Outstanding Contributions as a member of the National Training Vision Workgroup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Mr. Wofford on his retirement. He has been a valued employee and wise mentor to many other employees. He enjoys traveling, and we wish him well in the future as he has more time to enjoy this favored pastime.</paragraph>
