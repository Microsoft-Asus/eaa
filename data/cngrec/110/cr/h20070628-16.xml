  <speaking speaker="400234" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker for the opportunity to speak this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate my good friend, former colleague from Iowa, Jim Nussle, on the unveiling of his portrait today and I would encourage all of his former colleagues to attend that ceremony at 4 o'clock this afternoon in 210 in the Cannon House Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Nussle was a tireless advocate for the future of this country, and through the Budget Committee that he chaired for 6 years, did an outstanding job of fighting for the next generation to understand that the entitlement programs that are going to really cause devastation in our budgets in the future should be addressed, and fought tirelessly for the next generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, Jim Nussle has been nominated to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. There is no one better qualified than Jim Nussle, that has the skill to do this job, that has the budget knowledge. Jim Nussle is the most knowledgeable person we could possibly have in that position. He'll be a tireless advocate for a balanced budget, someone that can work across the aisle, as he did on the Budget Committee. And the comments from the ranking member last year really indicate  how well Jim Nussle will work for our country and to lead our Nation and to manage this enormous government that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's commend Jim Nussle, show up for the unveiling and really be advocates for him to continue his service for the country.</paragraph>
