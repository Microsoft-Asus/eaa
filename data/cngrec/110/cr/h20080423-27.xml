    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of America's bravest, one of America's finest, Kyle Wilks from the Third District of Arkansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kyle, a marine from Rogers, Arkansas, serving with the II Marine Expeditionary Force stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, died last week. He was in a convoy of 36 vehicles in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan when his vehicle was struck by an IED.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Kyle entered the Marine Corps to help others. His devotion to his friends, his family, and his unit was selfless. The commitment Kyle showed his fellow soldiers and his country is something we can all be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Kyle Wilks is a true American hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. I ask my colleagues to keep the Wilks' family and his friends in their thoughts and prayers during this very difficult time.</paragraph>
