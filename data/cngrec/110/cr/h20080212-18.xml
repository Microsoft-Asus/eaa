    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill> was introduced by our colleague, Representative Darrell Issa, and would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to construct facilities to provide water for irrigation, municipal, domestic, military, and other uses from the Santa Margarita River in California and for other purposes. Similar legislation introduced by Congressman Issa passed the House in the two previous Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have no objection to this noncontroversial bill, and I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill> was introduced by our colleague, Darrell Issa, and authorizes the construction of the groundwater recharge and pumping project in the lower Santa Margarita River basin in Southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If constructed, the project would provide much-needed water to the local water utility district as well as to Camp Pendleton, the Marine Corps base, for its military training needs. This project would augment the local water district supply, would relieve future additional demands for constantly limited imported water supplies, and would set aside and preserve valuable environmental habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project is an excellent example of local and Federal agencies working together to secure safe, dependable water supplies for future generations. This bill is good for water consumers, and it is good for our soldiers. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, which has been considered by the House twice already. Perhaps the third time will be the charm.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record an exchange of letters on this particular piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, January 4, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR NICK: On October 10, 2007, the Committee on Natural Resources ordered <bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill> to be reported. As you know, this measure contains certain provisions that are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed Services, and thus, was sequentially referred to the Committee on Armed Services by the Parliamentarian for the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Committee recognizes the importance of <bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill> and the need for the legislation to move expeditiously. Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over this legislation, the Committee on Armed Services will waive further consideration of <bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill>. I do so with the understanding that by waiving further consideration of the bill, the Committee does not waive any future jurisdictional claims over similar measures. In the event of a conference with the Senate on this bill, the Committee  on Armed Services reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter and a copy of the response in your Committee's report on <bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill> and the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate your willingness to waive rights to further consideration of <bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill>, even though your Committee has a jurisdictional interest in the matter and has received an additional referral. Of course, this waiver does not prejudice any further jurisdictional claims by your Committee over this legislation or similar language. Furthermore, I agree to support your request for appointment of conferees from the Committee on Armed Services if a conference is held on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the Committee's report on <bill type="h" number="29">H.R. 29</bill> has already been filed, this exchange of letters will be inserted in the Congressional Record as part of the consideration of the bill on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With warm regards, I am</paragraph>
