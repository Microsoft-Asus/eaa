  <narrative>LET'S NOT ALLOW GENOCIDE TO CONTINUE -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8623]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. MORAN of Virginia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the words "never again" ring hollow today. It was exactly 3 years ago that we declared that what was happening in Darfur was genocide, and yet we have basically stood on the sidelines for these last 3 years. Lots of words, but no meaningful action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we said was that we would deny the Government of Sudan access to oil revenues and extend American business sanctions on Sudan. But we haven't done either in any meaningful way. Hundreds of thousands of people, innocent people, killed; millions made homeless while we have sat on our hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oil accounts for 70 percent of Sudan's total exports. And do you know that 70 percent of Sudan's oil profits fund their military? And China buys much of their oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, China is Sudan's largest trading partner. We could have enormous leverage over China if we chose to use it, but we choose not to. So when the Chinese Premier goes over to Sudan, instead of telling him this is wrong, he offers to build more palaces for President Bashir. Let's get serious. Let's not allow genocide to continue in the 21st century.</paragraph>
