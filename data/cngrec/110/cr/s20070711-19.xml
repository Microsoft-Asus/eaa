  <narrative>HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (Senate - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9013">S9013</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, more time has passed, and more American troops have lost their lives overseas. I feel very strongly that we should take a few moments in the U.S. Senate to honor them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outside my office here in Washington, we have a tribute called "Faces of the Fallen." Visitors to the Senate from across the country have stopped by the memorial. I encourage my colleagues to come see this tribute on the third floor of the Hart Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I last came to the Senate floor to honor our fallen troops at the end of May. And between that time and the end of June, the Pentagon announced the deaths of 165 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. I want them to be remembered. So today, I will insert their names into the Record:</paragraph>
