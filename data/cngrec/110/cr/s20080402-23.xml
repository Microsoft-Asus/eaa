    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Tara Bounds and Phyllis Mitchell, a mother-daughter team that fought adversity and brought home a Gold and Bronze Medal from the 2007 World Games Special Olympics in Shanghai, China. I would like to take a few moments to discuss their tireless efforts to bring Team USA success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tara Bounds, a 25-year-old Ball, LA, resident, was diagnosed with Down's syndrome at birth. She began competing in the Special Olympics at age 8. However, it is only by miracle that Tara could even compete athletically. She also has a congenital heart defect and needed two surgeries before the age of 5 in order to live. Phyllis Mitchell coached Bounds along to help her win the Gold Medal in the softball throw and the Bronze Medal in the 50-meter run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The World Games were held from October 2 to October 11, 2007, with over 7,000 athletes participating from 110 countries. Tara persevered past three competitions: the area competition, the State competition in Hammond, LA, and the national competition in Iowa. In order to continue, you must win at least one Gold Medal in the State and national competition. However, Tara almost did not make it due to monetary reasons, but she held fundraisers, and the people of Louisiana chipped in to send her  to the World Olympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to practice, Tara ran at two local high schools, Pineville and Tioga. She also set up a target in her back yard to prepare for the softball toss. Tara ended up with a distance of 16.94 meters to win gold in the softball toss and ran the 50-meter run in 11.68 seconds to win bronze.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tara continues to strive for excellence and hopes to participate in the 2011 Special Olympics in Athens, Greece. We should all aspire to follow her example. Today, I congratulate Tara Bounds and Phyllis Mitchell for their victory, and I wish them continued success.</paragraph>
