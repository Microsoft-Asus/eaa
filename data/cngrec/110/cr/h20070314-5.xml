    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my great pleasure and honor to introduce a dear friend of mine and a very respected member of our community, Johann Christoph Arnold, for his opening prayer as the guest chaplain of the House of Representatives today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Johann Christoph Arnold and his wife, Verena, are senior pastors of Church Communities International, an international movement that is dedicated to peace around the world. They work very diligently and very effectively with families, with individuals, with veterans, and a host of other people to bring them the kind of counseling and conciliation they need in many communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Arnold and his wife, Verena, are the parents of eight children and 34 grandchildren. For over 35 years as family counselors, they have advised thousands of couples in our community and in many other places here in the United States and around the world. People have come to expect sound advice from this award-winning author, whose books have sold over 350,000 copies in English and have been translated into 19 other languages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great pleasure and an honor to have Johann Christoph Arnold, his wife, Verena, and other members of  their community here with us this morning; and I thank him very much for his opening prayer.</paragraph>
