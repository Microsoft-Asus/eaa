    <paragraph>Madam President, today with great pride I honor Mountain Home Air Force Base for their recent achievement of winning the Commander in Chief's Annual Award for Installation Excellence for an Air Force base. Over 85 Active-Duty Air Force installations competed this year for the award, and I was extremely pleased to get word that Idaho's own Air Force base came out the winner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, I have worked very closely with the different wing commanders at Mountain Home Air Force Base to ensure that their installation will provide our soldiers with the best living conditions and optimal training space to ensure that should they be called to duty, they would be fully prepared. I know firsthand that the work being done both at home and abroad by our airmen and soldiers at Mountain Home Air Force Base is among the best our military can offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 500 airmen and crew from Mountain Home Air Force Base are currently deployed in Afghanistan in support of our joint mission with NATO to provide freedom and security from terrorist, and they are serving with great courage and determination. I know that their fellow servicemembers, the Idaho delegation, and all of Idaho await their return and they will be greeted with a hero's welcome. Although they are not in Idaho to celebrate this very prestigious honor from the Secretary of Defense,  the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Commander in Chief, I know that their contributions greatly aided in Mountain Home Air Force Base receiving this award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COL Tony Rock, wing commander of the 366 Fighting Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base, expressed his pride of winning this award but gave the credit to the 4,000-plus men and women who operate the base on a daily basis. Colonel Rock was quoted as saying, "This award validates the hard work, commitment and pride of all our Gunfighters who work together to make Mountain Home the best base in the Air Force. I am simultaneously humbled and awed to be part of this team and lead our Gunfighters as  we continue to prove we are the premier combat wing in the entire Air Force."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I couldn't agree more with Colonel Rock's statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to extend the appreciation and congratulations of myself and all of Idaho to the soldiers and  civilians at Mountain Home Air Force Base for their incredible work serving and protecting our Nation.</paragraph>
