    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize for the week of May 13 an outstanding small business from my home State of Maine that has not only succeeded in manufacturing a product of great quality, but has also made its facilities environmentally friendly and energy efficient. Lyman Morse Boatbuilding of Thomaston, ME has produced boats for over 100 years. Noted for their expert craftsmanship and storied history, Lyman Morse has a proven track record of quality and success. In their  great spirit of innovation, Lyman Morse will be unveiling, on May 26, a "green"--or energy efficient--boat-building facility, and I want to take this opportunity to commend them for this fabulous attempt at conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyman Morse's new "green" building is a temperature-controlled facility  that is designed for the construction and service of large yachts. Completed in less than a year, the building is 140 feet long, 160 feet wide, and stands 55 feet high. What is particularly remarkable is that heat generated on the building's roof from the sun can be absorbed and used as energy for the building--a truly impressive feat in efficiency. While the new "green" building  will be Lyman Morse's largest, it will also be their most energy efficient, proving that conservation does not have to hamper effectiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To construct its new facility, I would like to point out that Lyman Morse took advantage of a tax deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings Congress enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and extended in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. Congress should heed the example of Lyman Morse, because by incorporating "green" building practices, we can reduce energy consumption, increase profitability--and create more jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Lyman Morse Boatbuilding follows in the historic tradition of New England boat building, particularly that of Midcoast Maine, I am so pleased that it has decided to take advantage of modern technology to be environmentally responsible. In fact, Lyman Morse has been a terrific corporate citizen for many years. I want to point out that in January 2006, the State of Maine declared Lyman Morse Boatbuilding a Maine Clean Boatyard and Marina. A program designed to help preserve and improve natural  resources while reducing pollution, the Maine Clean Boatyard and Marinas Program is a partnership of industry, state and federal agencies, and environmental organizations dedicated to promoting best management practices in boatyards and marinas. Participants must exceed Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Lyman Morse all the best for the grand opening of their building. It is always inspiring to see examples of good stewards of the environment in Maine, a state that has always appreciated the importance of nature in our everyday lives. Their willingness to protect the one environment that we have is a beautiful example to all of us.</paragraph>
