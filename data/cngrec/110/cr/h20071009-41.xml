    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, because I was detained by an important event in my district, I was unable to vote on <bill type="hr" number="32">H. Res. 32</bill>, regarding human rights and gender-based persecutions, and <bill type="h" number="400">H.R. 400</bill>, the "War Profiteering Prevention Act." Had I been present, I would have voted "yea" on both bills.</paragraph>
