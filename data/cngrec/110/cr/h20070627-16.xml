    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring attention to recent reports that the United States commanders in Iraq are rejecting the recommendations from Army mental health experts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address the rising number of returning war heroes with mental health problems, Army psychologists have said that troops need a 1-month reprieve for every 3 months in combat, a suggestion that's been brushed aside by these commanders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Denying troops the rest they need is another irresponsible move in a long line of policies that show a complete disregard for the well-being of our troops, such as being sent to war without adequate armor, being forced to complete multiple deployments, and when wounded, being subjected to a bureaucratic mess such as Walter Reed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I've only been in Congress since January, yet, this week, I made my sixth call to the spouse of a wounded or killed soldier in this war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm tired of this war. My constituents are tired of this war. The American people are tired of this war. It's time to put the health and well-being of our troops first. It's time to bring them home.</paragraph>
