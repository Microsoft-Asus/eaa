    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about problems that have arisen on the border between Egypt and Gaza.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the Hamas military took over all power in Gaza there has been massive smuggling of arms into Gaza along the border with Egypt, often by the use of tunnels that are proliferating along the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Egyptian government has made efforts to curb the smuggling by closing the border between their country and Gaza and by assigning more security personnel to patrol the border. However, the border remains porous in many areas and weapons continue to find their way across the border and into the hands of Hamas fighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With fears of refugees pouring into Egypt from Gaza and fears that Hamas will escalate its attack on Israel, this situation has become both a security and a humanitarian concern. Egypt has vowed to partner with Israel, the United States, and the European Union to work toward a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While part of the solution will be immediate increases in security forces at the border, a long-term solution is also needed. Egypt must take responsibility for the actions of its own people, and Israel must support Egypt's good-faith efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can come to some resolution of this problem.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
