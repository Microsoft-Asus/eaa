  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>With brave American soldiers dying in record numbers, I have just two questions for the President: Just whose posteriors are we kicking? And how do you know?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Sunnis and Shiites killing themselves and each other, plus an incompetent Maliki government, we don't know who we are fighting much less where we are kicking them. And while we are tied up in Iraq, al Qaeda thrives in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the President's turn of phrase will go into the Blooper Hall of Fame with other Bush golden oldies, like "last throes," "links to al Qaeda," and "mission accomplished."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a time when American success meant defeating Nazis, tearing down communism's iron curtain, and walking on the Moon. Supporting our troops meant honest safeguards, not trash talk. How low have our standards fallen when the President points to the debacle he created and says, "This is what I am proud of"?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Americans believe in a country that is capable of much higher standards. And if America were really kicking butt, the President wouldn't need to say anything. Everyone would know it.</paragraph>
