    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is a cause for celebration in the Fifth District of Pennsylvania today. This year marks the 75th anniversary of an American icon, Zippo lighters. In 1932 George Blaisdell developed the first Zippo lighter in a garage in Bradford, Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, though most products are disposable or available with limited warranties, the Zippo lighter is still backed by its famous lifetime guarantee: "It works or we fix it for free." A motto of a company that truly believes in its great product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In almost 75 years and nearly 450 million lighters later, where last year alone 50,000 lighters a day were produced in Bradford, Pennsylvania, Zippo lighters are a legacy of good business, and almost 70 percent of them are exported all around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today George Duke, Mr. Blaisdell's grandson, owns the company and is chairman of the board. Gregory Booth is Zippo's president and CEO. I know them both and appreciate their resolve to keep Zippo lighters manufactured in America and, more importantly, in Bradford, Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend them for their devotion to the people of Bradford and congratulate Zippo and the Zippo family for 75 years of great business.</paragraph>
