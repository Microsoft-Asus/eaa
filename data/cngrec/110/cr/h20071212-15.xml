    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week, congressional Republicans refused to join us in supporting energy legislation that will provide real relief to the American consumers. Instead, Republicans once again showed that they have no problems doing the bidding of both Big Oil and the utility companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, Washington has dragged its feet, denying that there was actually an energy problem. This new Democratic Congress is taking our Nation in a new direction. Our energy security plan is about producing more clean and renewable sources of energy right here in the United States. Over the next 10 years, this bill will create 10 million new green jobs by investing in renewable energy, with tax incentives for solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal technology. This investment will not only  be good for our economy, but it will also help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and will allow us to finally address global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this House has acted. Now it's time for the Senate and the White House to acknowledge our energy problems and join us in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
