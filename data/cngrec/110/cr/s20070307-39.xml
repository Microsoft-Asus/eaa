    <paragraph>Mr. President, we just approved the new Ambassador to Afghanistan. I do recall yesterday we approved the new Ambassador to Iraq. That is pretty good work of the Senate. These are two very important diplomats. They have their work cut out for them. I congratulate both of them.</paragraph>
