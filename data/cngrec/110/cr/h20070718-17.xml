  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democratic leadership in both this House and the United States Senate have made a conscious decision to bankrupt the domestic United States auto industry by forcing an antiquated CAFE standard on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I just want to remind my colleagues what this industry has meant to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 100 years ago, Henry Ford built the Model T, which brought automobiles to the masses, created opportunities that built America's middle class, and fundamentally changed our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, Michigan was known as the Arsenal of Democracy because we had the manufacturing capability to build the armaments that literally led the world to peace. For 2 years we didn't even build automobiles because we were building tanks and jeeps and B-24 bombers. And as we surrender our manufacturing capabilities to Japan and China, we had better hope that we never need the ability again to build armaments because we will be at the mercy of these foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 9/11, when everyone was concerned that our economy would go into a tailspin, the American automobile industry, the domestic auto industry,  offered zero interest financing, which, as GM said, has kept America rolling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never apologize for defending the domestic auto industry against the Democratic leadership.</paragraph>
