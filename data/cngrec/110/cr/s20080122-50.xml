  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, America's first Greek-letter organization established by Black college women. It is with great pride that I join my friends Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, Congresswomen DIANE WATSON, and Congresswoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON in extending our congratulations to all of its members on this tremendous occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 15, 1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority was founded at Howard University in Washington, DC, by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, who envisioned AKA as a source of social and intellectual enrichment for its members. Over the past century, AKA has evolved into a nationwide organization of college-trained women working to improve the socioeconomic conditions in their cities, States, and countries throughout the world. Today, the sorority serves through a membership of more than 200,000 women in 975 chapters  in the United States and several other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September 2005, along with my colleagues in the House, I had the pleasure of cohosting a reception on Capitol Hill for the House AKA leadership and nearly 100 members. I was reminded yet again of the remarkable strength and unwavering dedication of AKA to improve the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AKA's significant contributions to the Black community and to American society over the past century are widespread. From election reform and safety to and health care and education initiatives, AKA has raised money for and spread awareness about issues that directly impact countless lives across the country. In addition to advancing these services, AKA maintains a focus on strengthening the quality of life for its members. AKA cultivates and encourages high scholastic and ethical standards,  promotes unity and friendship among college women, alleviates problems facing girls and women, maintains a progressive interest in college life and continues to demonstrate the power of Ethel Hedgeman Lyle's vision a century later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today marks not only a moment for celebration but also a time to give thanks to all members for the significant contributions AKA have made to our communities and America over the past century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AKA's members have built an enduring legacy of leadership and service that has made a profound contribution to our history and to our future. As the women of AKA celebrate this significant milestone, I add to the chorus of thanks and praise for your 100 years of groundbreaking achievement and the many accomplishments yet to come.</paragraph>
