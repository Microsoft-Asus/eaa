    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a study by Harvard University and the Project for Excellence in Journalism has reaffirmed what many of us have long observed: Media coverage of Democratic Presidential candidates has been far more abundant and favorable than coverage of Republican Presidential candidates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The study found that 49 percent of all stories involved Democratic candidates, while just 31 percent involved Republican candidates. In addition, Democratic Presidential candidates received twice as much favorable coverage as Republicans, and Hillary Clinton drew nearly twice as much media coverage as any Republican nominee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until we hold journalists to the highest standards of their profession, unfair reporting will continue to influence elections and undermine our democracy.</paragraph>
