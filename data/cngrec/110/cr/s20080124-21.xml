  <speaking speaker="300019" topic="RECOGNIZING THE VILLAGE OF EASTLAKE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize and congratulate Leon N. Weiner &amp; Associates for their success with the Village of Eastlake in Wilmington, DE. For almost 60 years, Leon N. Weiner &amp; Associates has been doing outstanding work for the housing industry in Delaware and surrounding areas. Their work on the Village of Eastlake has made such a positive impact that the readers of Affordable Housing Finance Magazine recently named it the Nation's best affordable home ownership development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Eastlake neighborhood, which was built in 1943, was locally known as "the Bucket," meaning if people lived in Eastlake, they had hit the bottom of the bucket. The 267-unit public housing development, one of many in a crime-ridden neighborhood, became dilapidated despite the best efforts of the Wilmington Housing Authority. Violent crime and drug abuse grew to proportions exceeding some of the worst per capita crime rates in the Nation. In 1997 alone, Wilmington police were called to Eastlake  over 5,000 times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a decade of work, Leon N. Weiner &amp; Associates transformed the site, which is about the size of three city blocks, into the Village of Eastlake, an affordable housing project consisting of 70 rental and 90 home ownership units. Furthermore, their work here has helped jumpstart additional affordable housing projects in the city of Wilmington. A nonprofit and a for-profit firm have teamed up to build 72 town homes in the neighborhood, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All 90 units--62 town homes and 28 duplexes--at Eastlake consist of three bedrooms. The homes are reserved for households with widely varying incomes--as low as 26 percent of the area median income up to a high of 115 percent. Fifty-nine homes are reserved for households earning between 26 percent and 80 percent of the area median income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of Eastlake could not have been reached without the added help and efforts of many other entities, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, PNC Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, and the State of Delaware, which provided much needed funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I wish to recognize Leon N. Weiner &amp; Associates. Their work in the Eastlake community is commendable and most deserving of Affordable Housing Finance Magazine's Reader's Choice Award. They are an invaluable asset to our community, and I wish them all the best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a point of personal privilege, Leon Weiner, who passed away in 2002, was a personal friend of mine for over three decades. In fact, he was one of the first people I met after enrolling in the University of Delaware's MBA program in 1973. More importantly, throughout his life he was one of the strongest voices in this country calling for the creation of affordable housing for all Americans. He fervently believed that all families need and deserve a decent place to live, and he worked tirelessly  to ensure that government, the private sector, and nonprofits work together in pursuit of this goal. Unfortunately, he did not live to see one of his last dreams Eastlake become a reality, but it serves as a fitting memorable to him and to the team of dedicated men and women he led at Leon N. Weiner &amp; Associates. Together, they demonstrated and continue to demonstrate that it is possible to do good and do well at the same time.</paragraph>
