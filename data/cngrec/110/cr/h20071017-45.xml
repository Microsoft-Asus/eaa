  <narrative>GITMO VS. FEDERAL PRISON -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11696]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we hear much hype about how bad GITMO prison is. That's where we keep prisoners of war, those terrorists that have been captured on the battlefield that have tried to kill Americans. The uninformed have compared the place to a gulag and a dungeon. I have been there and the place is neither.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Be that as it may, some POWs are treated better there than our Border Agents Ramos and Compean, who were sent to Federal prison for shooting a  border drug smuggler. This is the case where our government let a drug dealer go free and put border protectors in prison for 11 and 12 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most POWs at GITMO are not in solitary confinement. But the border agents have been in solitary confinement for most of their sentences. The POWs get 9 hours a day of exercise, including soccer. The border agents spend 23 hours a day in their cells. The POWs watch Arabic TV. The border agents watch no TV. The POWs receive the same medical treatment as the United States military, but one border agent was assaulted in prison and didn't see a doctor for 5 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, only in America do we treat terrorists and POWs better in GITMO than we do border agents who went to prison for protecting the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
