    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pleasure that I introduce Bishop Earl J. Wright, Sr. as the guest chaplain for the day. The bishop is very well known in Detroit, and we have known each other since the 1950s, even before Coleman Young became the first African American mayor of our great city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has a number of responsibilities, but the one that I enjoy bringing to the membership's attention is that he is a founding and supporting pastor of Miller Memorial Church of God in Christ Number 2, located in Haiti. And, of course, we are honored to have his lovely and gracious wife, Dr. Robin L. Wright, who is the senior supervisor of the Church of God in Christ's Japanese Jurisdiction. In addition to being an evangelist, she is also a writer and a great help to the bishop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have known each other across the years, and I remember coming to him the first time I ran for Congress, and with the late Bishop Bailey, I was able to prevail in my very first election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bishop has shown himself as a true disciple of Christ, relying heavily on his favorite scripture, Romans 4:21: "And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform." He exemplifies service to his fellow man, allowing his words to always bring grace to the hearer. He constantly speaks words of hope, spreading the good news to all. He practices evangelism that reflects Christ-like compassion to reach the world with the gospel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Earl Wright, Sr. is a wonderful man of God, and I'm happy to know him and to welcome him to the floor of the House of Representatives today as guest chaplain.</paragraph>
