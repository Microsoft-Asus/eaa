  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="CONGRATULATING KATELYN BOWLES AND RILEY MILLER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate Ms. Katelyn Bowles and Ms. Riley Miller on receiving the Prudential Spirit of Community Award. Sponsored by Prudential Financial and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the Prudential Spirit of Community Award recognizes middle and high school students who perform outstanding community service at the local, State and national level. Each year, two students are chosen as State honorees from each of the 50 States, and the District  of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Bowles, a senior at Montgomery County High School in Mount Sterling, KY, has been recognized as one of the Commonwealth top youth volunteers. She spearheaded a campaign to renovate the Mount Sterling C&amp;O Train Depot, an integral part of the community tradition. By initiating a business plan between Future Business Leaders of America members and local government agencies, Ms. Bowles successfully secured $200,000 in grants for the project, including $153,000 from the Kentucky Transportation  Cabinet. Additionally, she managed to recruit fellow high school students to help with much of the renovation, scheduled to be completed next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being chosen as a State honoree, Ms. Miller, an eighth grader at Drakes Creek Middle School in Bowling Green, KY, has been selected as one of America's top 10 youth volunteers. She is recognized for her outstanding efforts in raising $50,000 for childhood cancer research over the past 3 years. Having lost two younger brothers to leukemia, raising money for cancer research is a particularly important mission for Ms. Miller. Last year alone, Ms. Miller managed 29 lemonade stands  with over 200 volunteers across Bowling Green, raising $19,000. This incredible feat demonstrates her exceptional dedication, organizational skill, and enormous capacity for leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Bowles and Ms. Miller have proven themselves to be exemplary students and volunteers, deserving of the Prudential Spirit of Community Award. They are an inspiration to the citizens of Kentucky and to student leaders and community volunteers everywhere. I look forward to seeing all that they will accomplish in the future.</paragraph>
