  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 308(a) of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in the resolution for energy legislation that meets certain conditions, including that such legislation not worsen the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for energy legislation. Therefore, pursuant to section 308(a), I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> printed in the Record.</paragraph>
