  <narrative>HONORING SUPERINTENDENT DAN NERAD -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6015]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for those, like me, who believe in the invaluable resource that is our public schools, it is a bittersweet time in the Green Bay School District. Dan Nerad, the superintendent of the largest public school system in my district for the past 7 years, is leaving to assume a similar position in Madison, Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dan began his career in Green Bay 33 years ago. He is known for his intelligence, for his integrity and for his candor. He tackled the toughest problems of our time in Wisconsin--school security and the achievement gap between minority and Caucasian students--while at the same time dealing with a shrinking financial resource.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While his leadership will be missed, he is to be congratulated for taking the next step in an already distinguished career. Green Bay's loss will almost certainly be Madison's gain. He leaves an indelible mark on our children, on our educators and on our community. And I wish him well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Superintendent Dan Nerad.</paragraph>
