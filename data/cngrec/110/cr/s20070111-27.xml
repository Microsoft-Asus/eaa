  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Maine native and member of the U.S. Army who has served our country for nearly 30 years with both honor and distinction. On this day of his retirement, COL Jyuji D. Hewitt will leave his post as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command, where he has worked steadfastly to ensure that our military services maintain the logistics and resources necessary to complete their missions and protect our country from the gravest of threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known by his fellow comrades as a man of candor and respect, Colonel Hewitt has amassed an impressive list of accolades and accomplishments throughout his career, which has taken him all over the world, to Germany, Korea, and Japan. However, his journey began in his home State: at the University of Maine-Orono. Shortly after graduating in 1978 with a bachelor of science in chemistry, Colonel Hewitt earned his commission as an officer through the ROTC Program. He then went on to earn a master's  degree in systems management from the Florida Institute of Technology, a master of sciences in physics from the University of New Hampshire, and a master's degree in strategic studies from the U.S. Army College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his education, Colonel Hewitt went on to fully utilize his expansive knowledge of science and military affairs by serving overseas as a nuclear policy officer, as well as program manager of the Defense Special Weapons Agency and Army Material Command liaison officer. Those whom he worked with appreciated his stringent managerial style, which often reflected both his personality and his acute understanding of business management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Balancing his time as a husband and father of two, Colonel Hewitt returned to the United States where among other leadership assignments, he served as a school instructor and team leader at the U.S. Army Ordnance Missile and Munitions School at Redstone Arsenal, AL. After joining the Joint Munitions Command as a commander of installations in Oklahoma and Iowa, Colonel Hewitt's ascension through the military ranks culminated in September 2005, with his promotion as Chief of Staff, a position of  great responsibility to the welfare and security of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel Hewitt's military awards and decorations are numerous, for they include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Meritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Army Achievement Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as he retires from the armed services, Colonel Hewitt deserves the highest of praise for his endless contributions to the military and the United States of America. His dedication and service is not only an asset to our Nation but serves as an inspiration to all Americans who know the price of freedom. Our Nation owes him a tremendous amount of gratitude, and I extend Colonel Hewitt my personal thank you for his service.</paragraph>
