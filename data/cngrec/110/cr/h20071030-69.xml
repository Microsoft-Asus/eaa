  <narrative>2007 COMMEMORATIVE COINS: LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL DESEGREGATION AND JAMESTOWN 400TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12209]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, passion for collecting things as children is something that we have all gone through. Each of us has perhaps collected coins or stamps. Not everyone collects stamps, not everyone collects coins, not everyone collects insects; but all of us appreciate the value of courage. And I rise tonight, Mr. Speaker, to talk about a coin that is now available for sale on the usmint.gov Web site, the commemorative coin honoring the bravery and courage and great public service of the  Little Rock Nine, the nine African American students that desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957. This year is the 50th anniversary of their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This side of the coin depicts a group of school children going to school with no other purpose than to get educated and act like kids. We sometimes forget that the Little Rock Nine 50 years ago were kids. They were children, demonstrating great bravery in trying to overcome the obstacles imposed by adults. And the coin on this side says "Liberty." The nine stars are to represent the Little Rock Nine. And it says: "Desegregation in Education, 2007, In God We Trust."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reverse side of this coin, it is a $1 coin, depicts Little Rock Central High School itself. It is still considered one of the Nation's most beautiful high schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Mr. Speaker, each year the Congress may authorize two commemorative coins. One of the coins that we authorize for sale during calendar year 2007 is this coin honoring the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School. The other one was by the late Representative Jo Ann Davis of Virginia honoring the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, our beloved colleague Jo Ann Davis, who recently passed away. Both coins tell a wonderful story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage the Members and encourage the public to go to the usmint.gov Web site and consider purchasing these coins as holiday presents, as a way to pass on the legacy of the story of the bravery of these nine students desegregating Little Rock Central High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the reasons I am interested in these coins being purchased at the usmint.gov Web site is because $10 of  every coin purchased goes to support telling that story of Little Rock Central High School. It is now a national historic site. The school is still functioning, one of the great robust high schools in Arkansas. There is a national park visitors center there. The gas station that was there in 1957 has been restored across the street. So many  ways to this story, but they can always use more money. There have been about 160,000 or so of these coins sold, and $10 of every coin goes to help tell this story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is a beautiful coin. When you see the coin itself, it's just exquisite in the detail. It is a silver dollar and they make wonderful presents. But, more importantly, they make a wonderful way of telling the legacy and telling the story of the bravery and courage of these nine children that are now adults, in their 60s, who overcame the prejudices that involved segregation of schools in 1957.</paragraph>
