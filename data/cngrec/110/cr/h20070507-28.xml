    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on April 7 in St. Louis, Missouri, the Michigan State Spartans beat the Boston College Eagles 3-1 to win the 2007 NCAA Hockey Championship, affectionately known annually as the Frozen Four.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The win gave the Michigan State hockey team their first championship in 21 years, and Spartan forward Justin Abdelkader rang it off the post and scored with 18.9 seconds to snap a 1-1 tie and bring home the championship for Michigan State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They scored three goals in the final 10 minutes of the game, and Spartan goalie Jeff Lerg was spectacular, making 29 saves and allowing only one goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Spartans won the hearts of underdogs everywhere. Their win capped an improbable four-game run by the third-seeded Michigan State team, who few considered to be championship contenders. In fact, the Spartans are only the second number three seed to make it to the championship game and the first in history to win it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justin Abdelkader was the 2007 Men's Frozen Four MVP, and the championship is Head Coach Rich Comley's second. He also won as head coach of Northern Michigan in 1991. He is one of only three coaches to have won titles with two different teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the second straight year that Boston College has lost in the championship game, and I did want to take a moment to highlight their achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, they lost in the finals to the Wisconsin Badgers, but prior to this year's championship, they had won 13 consecutive games, piling up a 29-11-2 record. They had multiple All-American candidates and two players who received All New England honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to the Spartan's head coach Rick Comley, Assistant Coaches Tom Newton, Brian Renfrew and Rob Woodward. I also want to recognize Michigan State University Athletic Director Ron Mason, President Lou Anna Simon and, most importantly, the Spartan players for their amazing season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412235" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Rogers), and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400342" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I also want to thank Bart Stupak from Michigan for working with us on this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to represent Michigan State University in the great State of Michigan. It is truly an extraordinary school with a proud history of world-class academics and championship athletics. Known for its quality in faculty, its research, it is certainly one of the finer universities, a proud tradition in  land grant institutions in this great State who is now headed by President Lou Anna Simon, who has done a tremendous job at the university in so many  areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But last month we got to witness Michigan State's winning tradition once again, this time on the biggest stage in college hockey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 7, the MSU hockey team won the Division I NCAA National Championship. The Spartans defeated Boston College by a score of 3-1, as we all know, and the winning goal came with only 18.9 seconds left in the game. It's no fun unless you make it close. Well, our Spartans certainly got our heart rates up that particular day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a hard-fought game against a top-ranked opponent, but as many of you know, the Spartans' specialty is winning. They came out on top.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Spartans scored three goals in the third period to spur a dramatic, comeback-from-behind victory. Justin Abdelkader scored the game-winning goal and was named MVP of the NCAA Frozen Four tournament. Chris Mueller put the game out of reach with an empty-net goal with just 1.2 seconds left on the clock. Goalie Jeff Lerg made 29 saves, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania discussed earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon their return to East Lansing, showing the school spirit, certainly the community's support, there were over 4,500 fans turned out for a parade and a rally at Munn Ice Arena on the campus of Michigan State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to the championship game, the MSU hockey squad burned through the NCAA Frozen Four tournament. The Spartans defeated Boston University, Notre Dame, University of Maine to reach that championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the tournament, the Spartans played top-notch defense against the Nation's best teams. They were 17 for 18 on penalty kills. Jeff Lerg made 104 saves and allowed only five goals in the tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you a little bit more about this historic championship season. The Spartans won the national championship for the third time in school history, the first since 1986 when current Athletic Director Ron Mason coached the team. Michigan State's Rick Comley, in his fifth year as head coach, won his first national title with Michigan State and the second national title as head coach. The Spartans compiled a 23-13-3 record and won the national championship as a number three seed in a field  of 16 tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many reasons to be proud of this Spartan team, and there are many reasons Michigan State fans are so proud of their hockey team and their university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michigan State remains the all-time winningest program in the history of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Former Head Coach Ron Mason has 924 victories, making him the all-time winningest coach in NCAA history. Current Head Coach Rick Comley has 714 wins, ranking fifth of all time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a Spartan and represent that fine Michigan State University, and on behalf of myself, the entire Michigan delegation, Bart Stupak for his special assistance, I would like to congratulate our head coach, Rick Comley; his hardworking staff and assistants; and the best hockey players on the ice, the Michigan State Spartans; and certainly their fans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Go Green.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Michigan. I know there is no greater Michigan State fan in this body than him and how thrilled he was when they brought home that title. So congratulations to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill was sponsored by Congressman Stupak from Michigan, and he apologizes for not being able to be here. We had a change in the schedule due to the budget discussion that we had that went on for an hour or so. He wanted me to point out specifically how happy he was for Head Coach Comley, whom he has known for his years at Northern Michigan where he won his first championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield back my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="325">H. Res. 325</bill>, as amended.</chair>
