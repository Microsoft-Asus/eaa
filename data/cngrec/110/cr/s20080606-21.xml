  <narrative>IN REMEMBRANCE OF JAMES BYRD, JR. -- (Senate - June 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5362">S5362</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to remember a life that was untimely taken and to recall a horrific hate crime that shocked a nation. Ten years ago this week James Byrd, Jr., was dragged 3 miles--chained to the back of pickup truck--on a rural road in Jasper County, TX, to his death. It was said that a blood trail of body parts and personal effects stretched over 2 miles, with Byrd's severed head, right arm, and neck found almost a mile from where his tattered torso was discarded. Byrd's  face had been spray painted black.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>James Byrd was a victim of the cruelest form of racial intolerance. He was murdered for no other reason than for the color of his skin. To think that such a senseless crime could occur in the wake of so many of our Nation's civil rights milestones is disheartening. It is also a stark reminder that much work remains to be done in protecting minorities and ending intolerance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No American should have to live in fear because of their sexual orientation, race, gender, national origin, or disability. As a nation, we cannot afford to become complacent. We must forever strive to reach the golden rings  of democracy--that is, equality, opportunity, freedom and tolerance. We must also remain vigilant and guard against individuals and groups that seek to marginalize and terrorize whole groups of individuals. That is why, as I have  done many times before, I come to the floor to urge my colleagues to enact Federal hate crimes legislation this year. We must pass this legislation and send a message that crimes of intolerance and hate are especially deplorable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government's first duty is to defend its citizens and to defend them against violence and harm associated with intolerance and hate. I have introduced legislation, the Matthew Shepard Act, with my colleague Senator TED KENNEDY, to ensure that the Government has all the resources necessary to investigate and prosecute hate-motivated crimes. The Matthew Shepard Act would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation of protecting all of its citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this anniversary of the death of James Byrd, let us renew our Nation's commitment to protecting all Americans regardless of their sexual orientation, race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, or color by passing the Matthew Shepard Act.</paragraph>
