  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the matters before the Senate have been here. There are no restrictions on any amendments that have been offered. We disposed of some campaign finance amendments that were offered yesterday. I know the amendments were offered in good faith, in good conscience by the authors of the amendments. I agree with the author of those amendments, that we need to take a look at campaign finance reform, but I think it  should be done in the  right way and that is to have hearings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we need extensive hearings on these matters. And both Senator Bennett and Senator Feinstein have agreed to do that. So if there are other campaign finance matters, we would approach those in the same manner as we did these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very important we finish this legislation. We are going to do the very best we can to do that, and we are going to finish it next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I told the Republican leader, late last night, that I am thinking of filing cloture tomorrow or Tuesday on this matter. I think people have had every opportunity to offer amendments, to debate those amendments. I am sure there will be others that will be offered and debated, I hope, today. It is an important piece of legislation. But I hope people would do their best to direct it toward what we are trying to do; that is, ethics and lobbying reform.</paragraph>
