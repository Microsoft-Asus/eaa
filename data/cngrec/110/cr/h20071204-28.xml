    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we stand united in this House as Americans without regard to political party so that we may honor the memory of the 32 people who lost their lives last year in the tragedy at Virginia Tech. The Nation mourned the loss of these innocent young people, and people across America responded generously in every way they could, including sending financial donations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a time of need, you can always count on the American people to open their hearts and their wallets and to show the world what it means to practice the common good. The Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund was established, and the American people collected and sent over $7 million to aid the families, establish scholarships, and help the Virginia Tech community through this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, our role in the people's House is a legislative one. We can make a difference by passing <bill type="h" number="4118">H.R. 4118</bill>, which will ensure that all the money received from the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund is not subjected to Federal income taxes. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill and, in so doing, rededicate themselves to strengthening our collective will to create a more just and civil Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, the tranquil campus of Virginia Tech and the town of Blacksburg was shattered by the actions of a lone gunman. The horror that the Virginia Tech community has experienced is something that every parent, every American, hopes never to learn has affected their families and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this horrendous and unspeakable violence showed the worst of mankind, it also showed what those of us who have been a part of Virginia Tech community for years have always known; the students, the instructors, the administrators, and the citizens of Blacksburg care deeply for one another and take great pride in their community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in the worst circumstances, the Virginia Tech community showed great compassion for their fellow man and did what they could to help each other. Liviu Librescu, a survivor of the Holocaust, blocked the doorway of his classroom so that his students could climb out of the windows to safety. Ryan Clark, a resident advisor in the West Ambler Johnston Hall, rushed into the hallway to help his fellow students when the first attack came, and became the second victim. And I was deeply saddened to  learn that one of my constituents, Henry Lee, a graduate of William Fleming High School in Roanoke, was one of those who died in the attack on Norris Hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days and months following this tragedy, the Virginia Tech community and Hokie Nation saw an outpouring of love and support from people around the country. The university saw donations come in excess of $7 million, as people sought to give aid to those affected. As time went on, the university had to decide how to use the money donated as a result of this horrific act, and the university made a wise and selfless choice. They decided that the best way to disburse this money was to put it  in the hands of those who experienced and lost the most as a result of this unspeakable violence. So, recently Virginia Tech distributed the money to 79 families or individuals. These are the families that have lost the most and have experienced emotional trauma that no one should ever have to experience. This money, given by the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the university has acted graciously to help the families, we have discovered that there is a new problem the families are facing, this time by the Federal Government. It has become apparent that the funds these families received will become significantly reduced because of taxes. These are funds some families desperately need to pay medical bills, funeral costs, and to simply rebuild their lives. The last thing these families need to worry about is an additional tax burden. And I guarantee  that those who gave so generously want their money going to help those directly affected, not paying taxes. I do not believe that these funds should be taxed or that it is Congress' intent that they should be taxed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, Congress passed Public Law 107-143. In this law, there is a provision that makes qualified disaster payments exempt from taxes. There is no doubt that the Virginia Tech tragedy was, in fact, a disaster. Ask any member of the Virginia Tech community, Hokie Nation, or citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and to them it unequivocally was. In fact, the Governor of Virginia declared so that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite this well-intentioned law that Congress passed to make tax-exempt payments from qualified disasters, the families and the university have all been told it is likely these funds will be taxed. It was not the intention of the Congress that disaster payments should be taxed; and so, I am proud to join with my neighbor from the Ninth Congressional District, Congressman Rick Boucher, who actually represents Blacksburg and Virginia Tech, in introducing this legislation that seeks to  have these funds, like those resulting from any other disaster, made tax exempt. I ask Members of this House to join us in passing this bill and help the Virginia Tech families rebuild their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tragedy at Virginia Tech will never leave our minds, but we in Congress have an opportunity to help rebuild this community. I ask all Members of Congress to join us in supporting this legislation. Let us help the families and those so personally affected as they seek to rebuild their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before speaking on this measure, I wish to engage the gentleman from Washington State in colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides that certain payments transferred from the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund be excluded from the gross income of the recipients of those payments. It is my understanding that, in providing for the exclusion, it is intended that both the transfer of the amounts by the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund and the making of the payments by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University are considered to be consistent with the exempt purpose of these respective entities, and that donors who  made contributions to the fund are, in principle, allowed a charitable contribution deduction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask the gentleman if this is also his understanding of the intent of the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, it is.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As my friend and colleague and neighbor from Virginia, Congressman Goodlatte, mentioned in his remarks, I have the privilege of representing Virginia's Ninth Congressional District in which Virginia Tech is situated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 16 of this year, a tragedy of a scale and senselessness that defies explanation befell that university, and it came to a campus that is known across our Nation for its friendliness, peacefulness, and for the normally close association that is found there among faculty and students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the wake of the tragedy, Virginia Tech President Charles Steger and the professional staff of the university reacted with poise, with dignity, and with strength under the most difficult and challenging circumstances imaginable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The skilled first responders of the town of Blacksburg, of the university's own security staff, and of Montgomery County, Virginia provided an outstanding service that saved lives and that prevented the loss from being even greater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the intervening time, much healing has occurred. Virginia Tech has a proud tradition of teaching, learning, and research. That tradition endures. Following the violent and senseless act, campuswide and communitywide determination and cohesion emerged. The resilience of southwest Virginians and the spirit of the region in which we live that has helped to make Virginia Tech a great institution is assuring for the university a strong recovery and an even stronger future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days following the tragedy, the university established a fund for the benefit of the tragedy's victims. It is called the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund. In an outpouring of sympathy and generous support from Virginia Tech alumni and friends across our Nation, more than 21,000 financial contributions totaling $8.5 million were made to the fund. Last month, Virginia Tech distributed these funds to the victims of the shooting in varying amounts based on the severity of the injuries that were  sustained. Approximately $7 million in direct cash payments were made. An additional $1.5 million in the form of scholarships and tuition assistance were disbursed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as Congress acted in the wake of the Oklahoma and 9/11 tragedies to declare donations to the victims of those tragedies to be tax exempt to the recipients, the bill before the House this afternoon would declare that payments from the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund not be taxable income to the victims and their families who received these payments. The colloquy in which I previously engaged with Mr. McDermott clarifies that it is our intent both that, in principle, contributions to the  fund be eligible for a charitable deduction, and that payments from the fund not be taxed to the payments' recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and his able and very helpful staff, for the outstanding assistance they have provided to me and to my partner Mr. Goodlatte in the process of bringing this measure to the House floor today. I want to thank Subcommittee Chairman McDermott for his assistance and for his gracious allotment of time to me this afternoon. And, I thank my friend and colleague and  neighbor in southwest Virginia Bob Goodlatte, the principle coauthor of this bipartisan measure. Mr. Goodlatte and I have consulted over the past several months in the shaping of this legislation, and I thank him for the partnership that we have on this measure and on many other initiatives to improve quality of life in the region that we both represent. It is truly a pleasure working with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before the House is also coauthored by our Virginia colleagues, Mr. Cantor, Mr. Scott, Mrs. Drake, Mr. Wolf, and Mr. Davis, and I want to thank them for their cosponsorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of <bill type="h" number="4118">H.R. 4118</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all were deeply affected by the tragic events of this past April at Virginia Tech. Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those who  lost loved ones and to those who are struggling to recover from their injuries. The days, weeks, and months since that dark day have been a time of healing for the Virginia Tech community, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the Nation. I am moved by the outpouring of compassion  and generosity that have been displayed since this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Virginia Tech University established the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund in order to aid in the healing process and generate financial support for those affected. Thousands of individuals gave graciously in the hope of assisting the victims' families in their time of need. In fact, Virginia Tech has distributed millions from the fund to the families of the 32 deceased victims and 47 injured students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The least that this Congress can do in assisting these families is to exempt payments made from the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund from Federal taxes, and I would like to thank Congressman Boucher for his leadership in crafting this bill and bringing it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from the Ninth Congressional District of Virginia (Mr. Boucher), a good friend and colleague, for his leadership in introducing this legislation. It's been a pleasure to work with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is, I think, fair to say on behalf of not only all members of the Virginia delegation, but all Members of Congress, our heart goes out to the families of the victims and to the Virginia Tech Community who suffered this horrendous tragedy. This is just a small way that we can make right a part of that by ensuring that the generosity of thousands of Americans across the country to the Virginia Tech Hokie Spirit Fund will see that money in its entirety go to the benefit intended by those  who donated it and for the purposes designated by the family members of the victims of this tragedy. So again, I thank Congressman Boucher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Cantor for his leadership on the Ways and Means Committee, as well as the effort that Congressman McCrery, our ranking member, and Chairman Rangel made in bringing this legislation to the floor as promptly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to also thank the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, and the staff of Congressman Boucher and myself for the hard work that they put in to making sure that this was done and done in a way that would benefit the families of the victims of this tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize myself for 1 minute to close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge approval of this measure. It would simply make payments to the victims of the tragedy that occurred in April of this year at Virginia Tech tax exempt to the recipients of those payments. Congress responded in a similar way following the Oklahoma City and 9/11 tragedies, and we ask that the House accord similar tax status to the payments that were recently made from the Hokie Spirit Memorial fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank all who have assisted in the construction of this measure. Particular thanks to my colleague, Mr. Goodlatte, for his leadership and hard work in bringing this measure to the floor today. And thanks again to the Chair and the subcommittee Chair of the Ways and Means Committee and their very capable staff for the excellent assistance and cooperation they provided to us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when an act of random cruelty bewilders us and pulls us down, exceptional displays of generosity, courage and heroism can serve as a potent counterforce. They comfort and replenish the bereaved, and they remind us of the extraordinary selflessness our people are capable of. Nowhere has this been truer than in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw numerous examples of students and faculty risking and giving their lives to spare others of the murderer's wrath. We saw a shaken Hokie Nation come together to begin a long healing process. But we also were moved by the outpouring of support from a deeply sympathetic Nation. Donors from across the country pumped over $7 million into the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund, which makes direct contributions to the victims and their families, as well as to scholarships in the victims' names.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, recipients have to pay taxes on their donations, an injustice that we hope this bill will promptly correct. There can be no denying that the kind folks who made contributions did not intend to enrich the Federal government's coffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many of the families and victims still suffering from the tragedy, this funding is urgent. As the grisly images and unprecedented horror of the Virginia Tech massacre recede further from the public's view, we mustn't turn our backs on Hokie Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="4118">H.R. 4118</bill>, a bill that will exclude from gross income, payments received by the grieving families and victims of the tragic Virginia Tech massacre from the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, April 16, 2007 is a day that will forever be seared into the collective memory of the American people as a day of terror, tragedy, loss, and mourning. It was a day when we were reminded of the frailty of life; and a day when we were reminded how much we, as a Nation, value the sanctity and freedom of our schools, colleges, and universities. For on that day, we learned that because of the murderous intentions of one person, the lives of 32 students and faculty members at the Virginia  Polytechnic Institute and State University had been snuffed out. One of the victims of this tragedy, Matthew La Porte, was a 20-year-old student from Dumont, New Jersey, and a constituent of mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of this tragedy, and in response to the generosity of people across the country, Virginia Tech founded the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund. Many donors contributed to this fund in memory of the victims of the massacre, and in support of those who survived it. Today, the fund has received contributions of over $7 million. And while no amount of money can ever replace the loss of a loved one, this legislation will ensure that all of the victims, families of victims, and survivors of  this tragedy receive payments from this fund without interference from the Internal Revenue Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is during times of great tragedy that the kindness and generosity of the American people is most apparent. It is in that spirit of generosity, and in the memory of all the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre, that I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="4118">H.R. 4118</bill>.</paragraph>
