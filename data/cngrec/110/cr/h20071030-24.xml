    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud this weekend's ratification of the contract between the United Auto Workers and Chrysler. The new contract creates a stronger domestic auto industry and modernizes the relationship between the Big Three and labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ratification by the rank and file signals a new day for the domestic auto industry that has been struggling for market share with its foreign competitors. And sincere congratulations to President Ron Gettelfinger of the UAW and his entire team on a job well done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The industry still faces many challenges, but this new pact between the UAW and Chrysler and an earlier deal with GM means that both sides have come together to move the industry forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good-faith negotiations proved that all of the stakeholders put the future of the domestic auto industry first as they worked towards manufacturing competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement secures jobs and allows the parties to move forward and to continue to create quality products and compete in the global marketplace. Again, congratulations. Well done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
