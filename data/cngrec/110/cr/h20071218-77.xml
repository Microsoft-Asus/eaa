    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember a spiritual warrior for her constituents and those who could not fight for themselves, JULIA CARSON. She served 6 years in Congress, but her experience here far outweighed her time here. She always remembered where she was from and how she got there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a tough lady. She spent her initial swearing in in the hospital recovering from double bypass surgery. She was a wonderful personal friend who I enjoyed spending time with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have my JULIA CARSON story. I remember a few years ago, we were going to an event at the Army-Navy Golf Club. We were going to a program, a celebration, and our driver got lost and made a wrong turn. We ended up on the seventh fairway. We were going up the hill, and the car couldn't go up and it couldn't go back. I panicked, but she was calm during this entire process. We eventually were rescued by the Capitol Hill Police. I will never forget that experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA CARSON was a classy lady, very classy. And I loved the way she dressed and the way she held herself. Like Paul in 2 Timothy 4:7, she fought the good fight and she finished the course. But most important, she kept the faith. JULIA, I will miss you.</paragraph>
