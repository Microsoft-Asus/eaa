    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Obey, Subcommittee Chairman Olver, and Ranking Members Lewis and Knollenberg. I also would like to thank them especially for their leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we understand that budgetary constraints are necessary and that budget challenges are a reality, just as invidious discrimination in housing is a reality. This is why Congress passed the Fair Housing Act of 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination not just on race, color and national origin, but also on religious, sexual status, disability and familial status. However, nearly 40 years after the passage of this act, 4 million fair housing violations occur annually, tens of thousands of complaints are filed, and most violations aren't investigated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Violations occur in the rental market when qualified renters are denied housing based upon invidious discrimination. Violations occur in the purchase market when qualified buyers are denied loans, pay more for loans, or are steered to the subprime market when they qualify for prime loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why we need to fund the Fair Housing Initiative Program to the level authorized of $26 million. The Fair Housing Initiative Program allows for testing. This will allow us to have persons who are equally qualified, perhaps one is disabled and one is not, to go out and seek a loan or a rental property. If the disabled person is denied, and the person that follows who is not disabled receives the loan or the property, then we are gathering the empirical data necessary to show that the discrimination  exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment would add $5.82 million to the bill to bring it to the $26 million authorized level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the need is there, the authorization exists, and the time to act is here. Let us keep the American dream alive for all persons who are qualified. Let's do our part on our watch to prevent invidious discrimination in housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is. My hope is that the gentleman and I would be able to work together to see if there is some means by which it can be accommodated.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="FAIR HOUSING ACTIVITIES">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will continue to yield, I thank the gentleman for that willingness to withdraw his amendment and for highlighting the issue that we have before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We simply could not increase this amount this year because of the budget constraints. The budget proposal here is the same as the 2007 enacted budget and slightly above the budget request by the administration. And the offset, the offset is in a place where there really isn't money to take from the offset to do this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first I want to give my thanks to Chairman Olver and to Mr. Knollenberg for doing a wonderful job on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I intend to withdraw this amendment, but if I can just take a moment or two to discuss the importance of HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control, I would like to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funding is crucial in reaching our goal of eliminating childhood lead poisoning nationwide by 2010. The grants provided by HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control allow cities and States to correct serious lead hazard in low-income and high-risk homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, Mr. Chairman, this is not just an isolated problem. Lead poisoning affects over 250,000 American children under the age of 5 each and every year. High levels of lead in the blood have been linked to childhood asthma, brain damage, hearing loss, hyperactivity, developmental delays, and in extreme cases, exposure to lead has caused seizures, comas, and even death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district alone, over 2,000 children fall victim to lead poisoning every year. Over half of all the homes in Niagara and Erie counties were built before 1950 and are therefore very likely to contain lead. And just in Erie County, 1,000 children have unsafe lead levels in their blood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Rochester is among the top 10 cities in the United States with the worst lead paint problems. In 2004, 900 children in Monroe County were reported to have high blood lead levels. We have a city ordinance in effect to try to deal with that, but we have not enough money obviously to take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The grants are so important. They are targeted to help the most vulnerable of our citizens, children under 5 years of age. But in order to be more effective, they have to have adequate funding. Since the bill before us only funds the Office of Lead Hazard Control at $130 million, we wanted to put in this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I commend the chairman for putting together this thoughtful and solid bill, and I hope we can work together in conference to try to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> At the end of title II (before the short title), add the following new section:</chair>
  <chair> Sec. __X. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, approve additional Moving to Work Demonstration Agreements, which are entered into between a public housing agency and the Secretary under section 204 of Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (as contained in section 101(e) of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134; 42  U.S.C. 1437f note)), but at no time may the number of active Moving to Work Demonstration Agreements exceed 32.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400277" topic="NOT VOTING--15">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Moving to Work program has enabled Public Housing Authorities, PHAs, to create jobs for residents, add affordable housing stock, and help families build savings. Such efforts have gained recognition as being very successful in serving more families and helping recipients to self-sufficiency. The innovation and flexibility of the Moving to Work program helps more families realize self-sufficiency through locally oriented programs instead of HUD's  one-size-fits-all approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these benefits, only 24 of the more than 3,000 PHAs in the Nation are participating in the Moving to Work program. This amendment merely clarifies existing law in order to eliminate confusion at HUD about the number of PHAs authorized to be designated as Moving to Work. Congress has authorized 32 PHAs to participate in the Moving to Work program. Despite this clear intent to have 32 PHAs be designated as Moving to Work, due to what I view as a misinterpretation at HUD, there are only  24 agencies that are currently allowed to participate in the Moving to Work program. Once PHAs leave the Moving to Work program, HUD has said that no new agencies can be selected to fill their vacancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This simple and straightforward amendment would clarify Congress's intent to require HUD to implement Moving to Work at its fully authorized level. The amendment directs the Secretary of HUD to promptly approve new PHAs to participate in the Moving to Work program whenever the number of agencies is less than the total number and level we have authorized at 32. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask to engage the chairman of Transportation and HUD in another colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have serious concerns about the administration's proposal to increase the Federal Housing Administration's multifamily mortgage insurance premium by 35 percent for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration proposed a similar increase last year, and rescinded it after hearing from Members of Congress and those in the industry most affected. I believe we again do not have sufficient information about the impact of this proposal on affordable rental housing for American workforces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Financial Services Committee Mr. Frank and I are currently circulating a letter to HUD among our colleagues opposing the increase in the premium. As of Monday, we have 106 Members of Congress on record opposing the increase. A similar letter sent to HUD was recently signed by 38 Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe an increase in the premium will impact the communities where housing would be built as well as tenants in those projects. HUD needs to perform a full assessment of the likely impact of such a premium increase on the volume of multifamily rental housing development, and the consequential effects of higher financing costs on rents to be borne by moderate-income residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This thorough assessment of the potential adverse effects of the proposed premium increase needs to be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees, giving Congress the opportunity to evaluate the proposal. This would need to happen before allowing the increase to go into effect by simple notice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. It would eliminate funding for the absolute worst performing line at Amtrak, the Sunset Limited, which runs from New Orleans to Los Angeles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1997, Congress passed the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, which required that Amtrak operate without any Federal operating assistance after 2002. Despite this commonsense requirement that they cease their fiscal irresponsibility and mismanagement, since Amtrak was supposed to be operating free of Federal subsidy, it has, instead, cost the taxpayers $3 billion in operating expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, people tuned in on C-SPAN to watch this debate may be wondering what exactly this $3 billion in taxpayer funding is paying for. Well, in the case of the Sunset Limited, it is being used to subsidize the travels of a very few passengers who want to take a train from New Orleans to Los Angeles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trip is scheduled to take 46 hours and 20 minutes to complete, that is, assuming the train is running on time. This occurrence is, however, exceedingly unlikely. According to Amtrak's most recent monthly performance report, the Sunset Limited was only on time 11 percent of the time. This makes the Sunset Limited the third worst on-time performer for any of Amtrak's 33 routes during 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps, Mr. Chairman, taxpayers should be happy when the train is not running, though, because when it is, the route loses an average of almost $30 million a year. This means that Amtrak and the American taxpayer lose $0.57 per mile for each passenger on this train. For 2006, it cost the Federal Government $524 per passenger on that route, more than revenue that was brought in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment is the first step to instilling just a small measure of fiscal discipline at Amtrak. Failure to do so will only allow Amtrak to continue misusing and wasting taxpayer dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is supported by the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens Against Government Waste. I hope that all my colleagues will join me and those taxpayer advocates in saving the taxpayers from throwing more good money after bad on the Sunset Limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to point out to the gentleman that the bill before us includes language that requires the Secretary of Transportation to review and ultimately approve or deny grant requests for each train route as part of the grant agreement. When grant requests are submitted to the Secretary, they include a detailed financial analysis and revenue projections, and the Secretary then determines whether to approve the grant request for the specific train route.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to make another comment here. All too often we forget about rural areas. Rural communities deserve transportation choices. This line serves a number of rural areas in the South and Southwest. But I do again remind that the Secretary has the authority to review the financials in relation to a particular route and to approve or disapprove of grant requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak has made some good moves over the recent past. They've reduced their debt by $500 million. They have exacted about $100 million of savings so far in their effort to reduce the costs of the long-distance routes. They've increased the amount of State investment that's involved in these routes, and they continue to show better revenue and ridership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the route to deal with individual routes, the way to deal with individual routes is through the language that's already in the bill, and so I'm going to oppose the specific effort to eliminate one specific route when the route is already in place in the legislation for the Secretary to make that decision.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, here we go again, trying to destroy passenger rail in this country. The United States used to be the best passenger rail system in the world. Now we're the caboose, and we don't even use cabooses anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long this Congress has given Amtrak just enough money to limp along, never giving them the funds they needed to make serious improvements in the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak was a first responder during Hurricane Katrina and used the Sunset Limited line to help evacuate thousands of gulf region residents while President Bush and his administration was nowhere to be found. Now they are becoming a key part of each State's future evacuation plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every industrialized country in the world is investing heavily in rail infrastructure because they realize that this is the future of transportation. But, sadly, as their systems get bigger and better, our system gets less and less money.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thought we spent most of last night on amendments to kill the operating account of Amtrak and then kill the capital account of Amtrak. The only thing that wasn't offered was burial funds for Amtrak. But now comes the dismemberment amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This route is part of a national passenger rail system. It's the only route connecting California to the Southwest, to the gulf, and on to Florida. This route touches one-third of the Nation's population. Many of the people living in those communities along this route have no other passenger transportation, mass transportation alternative than the Sunset Limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Texas talked about the time it takes to traverse that route. What he didn't say is that most of that time is spent by Amtrak on sidings waiting for freight rail trains to pass. Now, if you give passenger rail priority consideration on those routes, those trains would pass very quickly. We could cut a substantial, maybe a third or more of the time out of their passenger service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's happening here is, going back to the origins of Amtrak, when freight rail companies started as passenger rail service found they could make more money carrying freight than passengers, they were carrying U.S. mail on the overnight railway post office, they petitioned to the Interstate Commerce Commission to discontinue passenger service when U.S. Postal Service moved to carrying their mail by truck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So one by one, they discontinued passenger rail service, dumped it all in the hands of the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to keep Amtrak servicing. Defeat this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to point something out. Last night the committee, while most Members were able to leave for dinner, the committee had to stay here and work until 10 p.m..

    <paragraph>Under the House rules, the committee could have chosen to rise and we could have moved to final passage without considering any of the other amendments that are still pending. The committee chose not to do that, out of fairness.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee for their indulgence here. I just wanted to make sure that Members who have earmarks that are being challenged here have the ability to come to the floor and are able to defend them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, Mr. Chairman, would strike $300,000 from funding for the Belmont Complex in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Belmont Complex is a local recreational center. It offers an Olympic-size swimming pool with a 150-foot water slide and an indoor skating rink and arena. The center has an adult hockey team and also offers indoor soccer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To generate money, the center sells advertising space on the ice. A dashboard ad costs about $800. The center also charges $5 a day for admission to the pool. Individual pool memberships for the summer season are also available, and they can run up to $77.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, apparently, despite all the available revenue streams, the Federal taxpayers are being asked to pay $300,000 for this recreational center to rebuild or renovate the center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bad news is I don't think any of us are given a free pass. We aren't given a season pass. That is something that is just for the locals. I think the entire project should be for the locals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reading through this, it struck me that virtually every Member here in this body has probably a dozen or so of these recreational centers in their district that we could, with the same justification here, come to the Congress and say we need a Federal taxpayer subsidy for this. We are not charging enough for people to come in, where our local funds are low, so we are going to give the Federal taxpayer the chance to pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We simply can't do that, obviously. We can't fund all the recreational centers across the country. So why do we choose this one? Why do we pick winners and losers here? Is it just because there is a particularly powerful Member who is behind it who can say, hey, I am going to get funds for my district for this recreational center? What happens to all the other ones? What do you tell the recreational center down the street just across the district line? You're out of luck? You have to charge more  for your season passes?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It just doesn't seem fair to me. This isn't the road we should go down. And if we have turned over a new leaf, and we are doing something different in terms of earmarks, then let's do something different instead of the same old same old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are told that we are going to have a process that vets these a little better. There are, I believe, about 1,500 earmarks in this bill. We just got word of what they were just a couple of days ago. And so it just doesn't seem that the process is changing all that much. It looks too much now like it did when Republicans were in charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think that we ought to change it, and that is why I am offering this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the gentleman offering this amendment doesn't happen to be here at the moment; so let me try to point out what is involved here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, the Belmont Complex does provide recreational opportunities and conference and meeting space. Yes, it is a facility that is used for Chamber of Commerce meetings, and banquets, and business, and seminars, and training and testing for displaced workers, and local union meetings and negotiations, emergency rescue training, voter registration drives, local business-to-business job fairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the county, Armstrong County in Pennsylvania, which is one of those in the northern part of Appalachia that is struggling hard, losing population, by the way, if I remember the map exactly correctly. I was from Pennsylvania in an earlier period of my lifetime. These are all purposes that are important to the process of keeping the economy going in that community and that county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But most important to this particular earmark is that a 2003 fire damaged much of the building, and these funds are needed to make continual interior and exterior renovations and to make the facility handicapped-accessible. Those are important specific things that go beyond the other bits and pieces that are pulled together in this complex. The main building within the complex has had fire damage and needs this money for repair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I just want to point out that the great explosion, the truly irresponsible explosion, of congressional earmarking began shortly after the party which is in the minority gained control of the Congress in 1995. And so during that period of time, we have gone from zero earmarking in the Labor, Health, and Education budget to over $1 billion a year. We have tripled the number of earmarks in the defense bill. The number of earmarks in this legislation, while it has been reorganized a couple times,  has gone up in similar kind of proportion. Yet this year, this year, we are reducing the number of earmarks and the number of dollars involved in those earmarks by 50 percent from what they were under the last time that a budget was put through completely with earmarks under the leadership of the gentleman's party. So we are trying to clean up a mess and get a good strong measure of the earmarking process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this one, I think, is legitimate for its purposes, and I hope the amendment will be defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me just say if you can justify this earmark for a recreational center to help them basically defray cost of memberships or to rebuild or renovate, you could do that for any recreational center in the country. There is nothing that I can see, and I wish the sponsor of the amendment would have come to the floor to actually defend it or shed some light on what makes this special, why there is a Federal nexus here that doesn't exist with other recreational centers across  the country. I wish we  could have had that debate or not. So we have to assume that this is no different than any recreational center anywhere in the country. So if you can justify this one, you can justify any of them. And we simply can't afford that, and we shouldn't continue just to say, well, we have cut the number</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This process is out of control. It remains out of control. And this earmark is a great example of that. If we can approve earmarks for this kind of thing, anything goes. Katy bar the door.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it was not my intention to speak on any of these earmarks, but the discussion that has gone on between the chairman and the gentleman from Arizona I was listening to upstairs, and it struck me that there needed to be some addition to this discussion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The suggestion that earmarks exploded as of the time the control of the Congress changed in 1995 and began to expand, et cetera, et cetera, is accurate, accurate, but for reasons entirely different than the gentleman from Arizona either realizes or understands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fact that the other party controlled the Congress for 40 years, and over all those years their chairmen, their subcommittee chairmen, their very high-ranking Members around here with years and years of power had developed very solid relationships with the second and third level in the various agencies around this town. And there weren't earmarks; there were phone marks. Key staff and otherwise were instructed to call those second- and third-tier people within the agencies and let them  know what they thought the priorities should be. There wasn't a need for legislative earmarks because phone marks had a very significant impact upon the process. And we tend to ignore that reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the majority did change, the new majority found that that second and third level of bureaucracy weren't nearly as responsive to people with Rs after their name, or Republicans, and thus they began giving some specific direction as to what their priorities were, thus the term called "earmarks."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, I think the gentleman does his party a disservice by suggesting that this was our fault. The reality is that even the earmarks where they are represent in the neighborhood of 1 percent of all the discretionary spending available in the appropriations process, and that while the Constitution says that appropriations should begin in the House of Representatives, to suggest that Members having ideas as to what priorities ought to be and even putting it in legislation is wrong, it seems  to me, in connection with that, the gentleman is wrong.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me just respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is we went from about, as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee often points out, from zero earmarks in Labor-HHS to some 1,400 last week. Much of that was under my party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Democrats are as much to blame probably as Republicans are. The difference is as Republicans, we pretend to stand for limited government. We should be saying this isn't what we should be doing. If the agencies are out of control, we need to rein them in through the oversight process rather than to try to compete with them in terms of wasteful spending.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I had not intended to speak on this issue either, but I feel required to respond to one thing that the gentleman from Arizona said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He indicated that it was too bad that he had only had 2 or 3 days during which time he could review the earmarks in this bill. I simply want to say if he feels badly about that and wants to know why that is the case, all he has to do is look in the mirror along with a number of his other colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do I say that? Because I tried about a month ago to make clear to the House that I thought the Appropriations Committee staff had had insufficient time to take a look at and screen a number of these earmarks, especially those that came early in the process. So I offered up another option, and what I proposed is that the committee simply be given more time to screen those earmarks, and that before the Congress adjourned in August, we would then publish all of them, and any persons who had  doubts about them would have more than 30 days over the August recess, and our staffs could have reviewed each and every one of them for a much longer period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman and others on that side of the aisle chose to belittle that proposal, suggesting that we were trying to, quote, "hide earmarks until conference." Not so. All we were trying to do was to give the staff and any Members who were interested additional time in which to review those earmarks. Our friends on the other side decided that they would rather criticize than agree to that, and so we acquiesced in their desires to have earmarks in each bill as they came to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We felt that there would be ample protection for Members because we also included a reform that would have required persons in the conference to be present and voting on every single item rather than having to endure what has happened in the past when large amounts of legislation were slipped into conference reports without a vote of the conference after the conference is over. But our judgment was not followed, and so as a result, we have this very limited time for Members to review projects  as they come through in regular order. I'm sorry about that. But I would say to the gentleman, no one in this House can have it both ways. We've tried to accommodate the wishes of the House. Either way, we're doing the best we can. And if the gentleman doesn't like it, I think, as I say, all he has to do is look in the mirror because it was comments from people like him that required us to follow this procedure in this manner.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Let me just say, in response to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, this isn't the best process. I appreciate having a couple of days and being able to come to the floor. The problem is, under what was proposed by the chairman, we would have had more time, yes, but we wouldn't have had the ability to challenge individual earmarks. So that was a trade-off that we were unwilling to make. And I still maintain that we made the best decision here. But I think it would be nice  to have more than a couple of days to actually look at these, but I appreciate that the Appropriations Committee is doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would prohibit $250,000 in Federal funds from going to the Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center in Prosser, Washington, and reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm sure people like to be wined and dined, but I think this earmark goes a little too far. I think that this is another example of, if we can justify economic development here, then we can justify just about anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We often complain that the Federal Government, the agencies spend willy-nilly, they're wasting money here, they're wasting money there. They are, certainly. One amendment that I wanted to bring today but got it too late would be one to simply cut the account that provides economic development earmarks because I think the Federal agencies do waste money in this regard. But instead of reining that account in and saying you shouldn't be doing that, we're kind of competing with them and saying we're  going to do our own economic development earmarks. I just fail to see a Federal nexus that exists here that wouldn't exist with other organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can justify anything in terms of economic development. The act of spending money by itself inherently means there is economic development. But where do we choose? Do we just choose this one or that one? It just doesn't seem to be a very good process, particularly without a real Federal nexus here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the gentleman, in his opening remarks, said something that currently should be expanded. Current law within HUD has an Office of Economic Development, and its responsibility, and I want to quote what its responsibility is, it "works with public and private sectors as well as not-for-profit organizations to provide financial and technical assistance to local communities to develop and implement their own economic development and community revitalization strategies." Now, that's current  law. If the gentleman believes that that agency shouldn't exist, then certainly he can introduce a bill, and we can have a worthy debate on that. But that is existing law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is within that context, then, as this relates to my district, which is a very diverse agriculture area, labor intensive in many of the specialty crops, but there is a new industry that is emerging in my district, and that is the wine industry. It's only about 35 years old. Historically, the wine industry in this country has always been in California. This is emerging in my district, and it has the benefit, then, of economic development to expand, to bring more tourists into this area,  which means there's more hotels, more restaurants. That is the very definition of what economic development is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me be very, very clear on this. This project is fully consistent with requirements for projects normally and routinely funded under this program and existing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I might add, it is named for an individual who has been widely recognized as the father of the Washington wine industry. He is the one who convinced farmers to transfer some of their lands to growing wine grapes. And, frankly, they've been very successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been $5 million raised by other governmental agencies and quasi-governmental agencies to build this center. This is part of that. What it demonstrates to me is that there is a strong commitment of this wide community that identifies this as a local economic development project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while there has been a lot of discussion with the earmarks this year, and I suspect we will have more of those discussions, I firmly believe that within existing laws and within the context of economic development, this falls into a category that I feel very, very comfortable with in saying that we ought to earmark dollars for this center because it will expand the economic development in this largely rural area that I have the privilege of representing. So, to me, it is an example of what  the economic development initiative is supposed to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Washington wine industry revenues are estimated at about $3 billion a year. The industry employs, I believe, about 11,000 people. Over 2 million people visit Washington wineries every year. That's just the point I was making. This is an industry that does pretty well. And I just wonder why the Federal taxpayer has to be involved here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public/private partnerships, there is nothing bad about that on its face; but not every public/private partnership is justified, particularly when that partner is the Federal Government. I just still fail to see a nexus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, we should actually be providing more oversight of the Federal agencies that expend these economic development grants because a lot of it is wasted. I'm sure a lot of it is wasted in my own district. But we shouldn't be trying to compete with that account by earmarking our own funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me restate again that it is existing law within HUD of this office that provides for economic development. I am simply following the law and exercising my right as a Member of Congress, who is part of the writing of the appropriation bills, to earmark what I think is important for my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if the gentleman wants to, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, if he wants to have a debate on whether that office ought to exist, well, I think that is worthy of debate. In fact, I would have suggested to the gentleman that maybe he should have defunded completely the whole office; therefore, he could have been at least consistent rather than picking out one project that I think is worthy, following what the requirements are of the Economic Development Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, I would urge my colleagues to oppose the Flake amendment as it relates to the Walter Clore Center.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as mentioned, this amendment would strike $400,000 in the bill from the North Central Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the certification letter submitted by the sponsor, the commission will receive Federal funding to establish the Technology Revolving Loan Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Web site, the commission is a public agency dedicated to providing professional services to local governments. These services include economic development, geographic information systems, intergovernmental cooperation, land use planning, and transportation. The commission's funding comes from Federal grants and State and local money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This earmark brings up a lot of questions. First and foremost, why is this fund being created in one particular part of Wisconsin? I'm sure every Member of Congress would love to establish a revolving loan fund to help their local businesses. If it is deserving of Federal aid, why aren't others? Again, why do we pick and choose here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can the sponsor of this earmark assure us that once this is done, that once these monies are loaned out, that more monies won't be sought? Is this an earmark that will beget more earmarks? It seems that these are questions that should be answered. It's a dangerous slippery slope, I think, if we use Federal taxpayer dollars for parochial revolving loan funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I seek to control the time in opposition, and I reserve my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, here is just another example, and maybe the sponsor of the earmark can enlighten us, but as to what makes this different, what makes this deserving of Federal funds? Why are we helping to set up a local revolving loan fund for local businesses? What is to stop every Member of Congress from wanting that in their own district? Isn't this a slippery slope if we just allow taxpayer money to be used in this fashion? If you can use it for economic development, if that is the  criterion, any spending is justified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman has indicated, this provides funds for a revolving loan fund for North Central Regional Planning Commission. The purpose is to provide small low-interest loans for small business start-ups or expansions. It is targeted to enterprises which have little access to capital and need to change the technology which they use in production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The planning commission is established by county governments under State statutory authority. It provides zoning and economic development assistance to counties. The planning commission covers a 10-county area and three congressional districts, mine, the gentleman from the eighth, Mr. Kagen, formerly Mr. Green, and also Mr. Petri's district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are we providing funds for this area? Very simple: this is an economically challenged area. And I make no apology whatsoever in trying to provide some modest assistance to the area. We have a similar fund in two other parts of my congressional direct. In Chippewa County, for instance, 3 years ago we established a similar fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That fund has saved 58 jobs in the area. They have provided grants, very small grants, to businesses in question, and they have already received $200,000 in repayments. All of the repayments are current.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want to ask a series of questions about the gentleman's district. I make no apology for trying to provide small loans to domestic small business entrepreneurs. In the 10 years that I chaired the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I learned very quickly the value of small loans rather than large, megadevelopment projects. I see no reason why we shouldn't provide those same lessons here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it ironic that someone from Arizona would challenge economic development funds in Wisconsin. Arizona ranks 24th in the Nation in per capita Federal dollars spent in Arizona; Wisconsin ranks 48th. So the gentleman is exactly twice as well off in terms of State ranking than my own State. Arizona receives $41 billion in Federal funds out of the budget; my State receives $31 billion. Arizona receives $7,300 per person; Wisconsin receives $5,675 per person. That is a $1,600 per capita difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty-five percent of the difference in what our two States get is due to differences in Federal salaries and in procurement. Arizona gets $7 billion more out of the Federal Government because of money spent for procurement than does the State of Wisconsin. In fact, Arizona gets a lot more money than all of the States in the upper Midwest. Arizona, as I said, ranks 24th. Wisconsin ranks 48th in per capita expenditure, Michigan ranks 47th, Minnesota 49th, Illinois 46th, Indiana 45th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a per capita basis, Arizona gets 28 percent more out of the Federal budget than does Wisconsin. It gets 22 percent more per capita than does Michigan, 29 percent more than does Minnesota, 21 percent more than does Illinois, and 20 percent more than does Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also point out that I doubt very much that the Arizona delegation doesn't work very hard to see to it that giant defense contractors like Raytheon, Boeing, Honeywell and General Dynamics together receive almost $4 billion in funding from the Federal Government. I doubt very much that the delegations from those States don't work to get that money in their States. So I make no apology for this tiny pittance that we are trying to provide for my own State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I also want to say, however, I think it comes with considerable ill grace for someone from Arizona to question the expenditure of $400,000 in Wisconsin, when Arizona has been the principal recipient of the second largest Federal earmark in the history of earmarking in this country, the Central Arizona Project. For Arizona, we have already spent $4.3 billion. The total cost of that project is expected to be $5.6 billion. The President's request is at $27 million this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, that seems to me to be the pot calling the kettle black. I would urge a "no" vote on this amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to continue my observations about what the gentleman receives from the Federal budget. The Republican Study Committee said that the $1.5 billion that was provided to the D.C. subway was the largest earmark in history. In fact, the Arizona project is almost four times as large as the D.C. subway. Yet the gentleman is complaining about a tiny $400,000 economic assistance grant for my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also simply note that the median household income in the gentleman's district is $48,000. The median household income in my own district is $39,000, a $9,000 difference. A good portion of that higher median income lies in the fact that Arizona has a very large number of Federal installations in the gentleman's State. Fort Huachuca and several other Air Force bases inject enough funds to provide employment for 9,000 additional people, yet the gentleman is objecting to a small revolving  loan fund which provides help in keeping about 50 jobs in Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I make no apology in trying to get the median family income in my district just a mite closer to the much higher income found in the gentleman's district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield for a colloquy to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, the chairman of the subcommittee, for this colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in New Jersey, and all over the country, certain waste handlers and railroad companies have tried to exploit a supposed loophole in Federal law in order to set up unregulated waste transfer facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, the Surface Transportation Board, or STB, has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers and the ability to grant Federal preemption over other laws at any level, local, State or Federal, that might impede such transportation. But Congress intended such authority to extend only to transportation by rail, not to the operation of facilities that are merely sited next to rail operations or have a business connection  to a rail company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, certain companies have exploited this loophole to build or plan waste transfer stations next to rail lines and avoid any regulation from State or local authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Senate's efforts to close this loophole. They have passed an amendment in their version of the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, and I wanted to thank your subcommittee for recognizing this important issue in this bill's report language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had intended to offer an amendment, which I will not offer at this time, that would take the STB out of the waste management business by ensuring that funding for any decisions relating to waste transfer stations be eliminated. Again, you have dealt with this in the bill's report language, so it is not necessary to move this amendment at this time. But it is important that States and local municipalities have some say in this process.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412233" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to add a word of my support of Mr. Pallone's amendment. The issue of companies circumventing the law and the wishes of cities and towns in this Nation deserves to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, in Bensalem, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a firm wanted to build a waste transfer station. Given the potential environmental and health risks, both the local community and even the State voiced their objections to the proposal. As an end run around this, the rail company that would service the proposed waste transfer facility applied to the Federal Surface Transportation Board, or the STB, to, in effect, have the waste transfer facility declared a rail facility. This was an attempt  to supersede the rulings of the State and local entities that had already rejected the proposed waste transfer station. Fortunately, the rail company's application was rejected, but they can reapply to the STB at any time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just yesterday I stood with Bensalem Mayor Joe DiGirolamo and Pennsylvania State Representative Gene DiGirolamo and opposed this facility. Mr. Chairman, people in the local, State and Federal level are all opposed to this end run around the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, when Congress created the STB, it was never intended to allow decisions by the STB to be used to override the wishes of cities and towns across the country, and certainly not as a means of superseding health and environmental regulations of State and local governments. Yet that is exactly what is happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his excellent leadership on this issue, and thank Chairman Olver for providing me the opportunity to speak today and stand up for the residents of Bensalem and the Eighth District of Pennsylvania.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues from New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Communities in my home in New York, including the village of Croton-on-Hudson in my district, are also being threatened by companies who are hoping to exploit this loophole through the STB to process solid waste without facing regulation under environmental protection laws. This type of activity is clearly outside the mission and the purview of the Surface Transportation  Board, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and chairman to affirm that reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman and the gentleman from New Jersey for their leadership and look forward to working as we go forward with you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, to respond to this, last night, as the gentleman from New Jersey has already pointed out, we had an amendment being offered which was subject to a point of order. I had agreed that I would be happy to work with him, and I obviously will be very happy to work with the three Members who are part of this colloquy from New Jersey, from Pennsylvania and from New York, on this issue, which is an important issue and would require authorization legislation to do, and that is  why the point of order lay last night.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first respond. I had yielded back my time when the gentleman from Wisconsin talked about Arizona, the Central Arizona Project as an earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps in the debate at the time it was called an earmark, but it doesn't fit the contemporary definition of earmark. There was no project over the history of this body probably that wasn't debated through authorization, appropriation, followed up by oversight, than a project like that. I would have no complaint if some of the projects that we are challenging here today went through that process of authorization, appropriation and oversight, but that isn't what this is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contemporary practice of earmarking that we have fallen into, under Republicans and Democrats, has been to circumvent the careful process of authorization, appropriation and oversight. So that is the complaint here. So bringing up the Central Arizona Project whenever an amendment is offered to take funding away from an economic development in a local community is a specious argument, I would add.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would prohibit $50,000 in Federal funds from being used by the National Forest Recreation Association for the National Mule and Packer Museum and would reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the earmark description and certification letter submitted to the Appropriations Committee, the funding would be used for the construction of a museum to memorialize and help to preserve the role of mule teams and mule packers in opening and developing the West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The funding, however, will go to the National Forest Recreation Association. Obviously, you cannot build much for $50,000. I assume there is a partnership with local entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is much that we don't know about this. Does the location exist? Will it be owned by the National Forest Recreation Association? Are there corporate sponsors? How much is the total cost of the museum? Will the Federal taxpayer be asked to pay more later on?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems there is a 20-mule team museum in Boren, California. This is at least the second mule and packer museum we know of. Does that one receive Federal funding?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would simply say it is time for the American taxpayer to say "whoa" and  stand up for fiscal sanity and actually stop the practice of earmarking like we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to rise in opposition to this amendment. As Mr. Hastings said earlier, there is in current law the Office of Economic Development, which has the responsibility of working with public and private sectors, as well as not-for-profit organizations, to provide financial and technical assistance to local communities to develop and implement their own economic development in their community. That's current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want to change that, I agree with much of what the gentleman has to say, I just think this is not the right time and place to be covering it in this manner. But it gives me a little bit of a chance to talk about my district, and all 435 of us, I think, love to have the opportunity to talk about our districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a map here which shows my district. It is the second largest district in California, a little over 21,000 square miles. I live down here. This is Nevada. This is central to northern California. It is about 450 miles this way, a couple hundred miles this way. A little perspective: eight States would fit within this county, one of the largest counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this county, the town of Bishop, some of the community people have every year for the last 40 years celebrated what they call Mule Days, and about 50,000 people come to this community of 3,500 people. In this whole county that I said eight States would fit in, about 17,000 people live, and about 3,500 people live in the town of Bishop. They are great people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here are the eastern Sierras, Death Valley. We have the lowest spot in the 48 States and the highest spot. Death Valley is 280 feet below sea level, and we have Mount Whitney that is about 15,000 feet above sea level. It is a great district, just as each of your districts are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, and actually they have been working on this for a few years, Bob Tanner and some of the people in Bishop thought that they should have a museum to celebrate the mules. Ninety-five percent of this county is owned by Federal and local governments. They don't have any room. There are only a few acres in this town that could even be developed. They don't have the land to develop for economic development. They rely totally on tourism, restaurants, motels, packers that take people  up into the mountains. Mules have been an important part of this, and they want to establish a museum. They are asking for $50,000. L.A. City is going to donate $2 million worth of land, 8 acres. The county and the city are putting up a little over a million and a half dollars, and the people that live there are going to raise another hundred, $250,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing that I think we forget is that the people in Bishop pay taxes. They pay Federal taxes, and I guarantee you that during the time that Jerry represented them and the time I have had the opportunity to represent them, they have gotten very little back from the Federal Government for the taxes that they have sent here to Washington.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, this territory was a part of my district for some time, and the people are incredibly wonderful people. They reflect the best of the American West. And there is no doubt that they are the best and they are there in the West in no small part because of the mule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say that the gentleman is making a very, very important point. It is a long, long ways away from somebody else's district to become an expert in terms of a subject like this. It causes me just to smile, and so I intend to help the gentleman if I possibly can by voting "no" on this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you a little bit about mules because this is one of the things that they are going to honor in this museum. George Washington introduced mules into our country. He received a jack donkey in 1786 from the King of Spain, and he started breeding and using mules. Within a few years, he had 58 mules working on his plantation a few miles south in Mount Vernon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, mules have been used to develop the West. All across the Nation, they helped the pioneers move. They could go 30 miles a day where wagon trains could only go about 5. They were an integral part of the development of this country. Even today, we have 600 mules on special assignment serving in Afghanistan helping the Army do the things that they helped the Army do 100 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think $50,000, you know, is a good contribution to give to these people, the money that they have sent back here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to thank the gentleman from Arizona for the opportunity to come to the floor to discuss the American Mule and Packer Museum and the economic development impact it will have on my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me first start by saying that this $50,000 is not included in this bill to laud the humble and noble mule. These funds will be used to boost tourism dollars in the small city of Bishop, CA by helping to build a local heritage museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Bishop is located in Inyo County--which is geographically one of the largest counties in the country and is 95 percent owned by the federal government. Bishop is a classic western frontier city and has been squeezed out of all other industries by the encroachment of federal land, which literally surrounds it and limits the community to survival on tourism dollars. Those vitally important dollars come from visitors eager to see the great Wild West, ride out like our forefathers into  the Eastern Sierra, enjoy the natural beauty on a hike, or hire a mule packer to explore the federal forests in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $50,000 dollar grant contained in this bill for the American Mule Museum is a modest federal investment in a worthy economic development project and a good example of how federal seed money is leveraged to develop local projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every year, at the fairgrounds on Main Street, the small city of Bishop hosts a famous and popular heritage festival known as "Mule Days." Some communities have an Apple Harvest festival, some have Frontier Days. In Bishop, we celebrate "Mule Days." My friend from Arizona may not be familiar with the essential role Packers and their trusted mules had to the settlement of the west, but California's home state President did. Next to me is a picture of then-Governor Ronald Reagan acting as the  Grand Marshall to the Bishop Mule Days parade in 1974.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mule Days is the single largest draw to that community, bringing fifty thousand Californians and tourists interested in frontier life into downtown Bishop, where they shop, dine and stay during the festival. In addition to honoring their history, this museum would help expand that tourism by drawing folks in year-round, rather than just during the long Memorial Day weekend Mule Days celebration. The City of Los Angeles, a longtime landholder in our northern county, is going to donate an estimated  8 acres, valued at $2,000,000 for the project. Inyo County will spend an additional $1.5 million with the hook-ups, parking lots and access roads. Finally, this federal grant, directed to National Forest and Recreation Association, in Woodlake, CA (the non-profit overseeing the project) and private fundraising will be used towards the excavation and reconstruction of the famed Livermore Packing Station, and the surrounding corrals in Bishop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a federal interest in preserving the history of how the West was settled. There are many residents in the city and surrounding areas who are direct descendants of those pioneers who headed west. A museum dedicated to local heritage and mule packers that were so important to the founding of the area will be a proper place to preserve their artifacts and documents into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The residents of the City of Bishop, my constituents and federal tax payers are dependent on tourism dollars for their city funds. There are 480 separate EDI projects listed in the THUD bill ranging from $50,000 up to $500,000 with the majority of projects falling in the $100 K to $200 K range. The projects, with a few exceptions, are for the planning, land purchase, construction or renovation of facilities deemed to be important to economic development in both rural and urban areas. The construction  of a museum celebrating local history is a common theme throughout many of the projects. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and help preserve a piece of American history in a place that is deserving of federal assistance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I am happy to yield to the gentleman from California.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman very much. As you can see, when I start talking about my district, I get pretty excited. I have a lot of good things to say about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop is a classic western frontier city. It has been squeezed out of all other big industries by all of the other public lands that are owned around them, and they have to survive on tourism. So if they can add this museum, it will help their tourism and it will help bring people there year-round, which will benefit their economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me say that this is a partnership. It is not just Federal dollars, even though there is no such thing as "Federal dollars." It all comes out of our pockets, and the people in Bishop pay those Federal dollars back here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as I mentioned earlier, the City of Los Angeles is going to participate by donating the land which is worth $2 million. Inyo County will spend an additional $1.5 million to work on the project, and local people will raise the difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final thing I wanted to say is that there are 480 separate economic development projects in this bill. According to current law, that is what the law required. The chairman and the ranking member have gone through, their staffs, they have evaluated all of the projects requested. Bob Tanner and his friends in Bishop that requested this project wrote up their project. They sent it to me and Senator Feinstein. We included it in the request. They were one of the ones chosen, one of the  480. These projects range from $50,000, this is the smallest, to $500,000, with the majority falling between $100,000 and $200,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The projects, with few exceptions, are for planning, land purchase, construction or renovation of facilities deemed to be important to economic development in both rural and urban areas. This is a very rural area. The construction of a museum celebrating local history is a common theme throughout many of these projects. We followed the law. We did the things that are asked of us. I think this is a worthy project.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am glad the gentleman brought up Ronald Reagan. I think it was Reagan, when he was presented with the highway bill back in 1987, that had, I believe, around 150 earmarks as opposed to the highway bill we did later, in 2005, with 6,300. He said at that time, "I haven't seen this much lard since I gave away ribbons at the county fair." So Ronald Reagan certainly recognized that Congress, at least at that stage, before we even got into the contemporary practice of earmarking,  was out of control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to make the point, and I am glad that the gentleman mentioned, there is no such thing as Federal money. It is money given by the taxpayer to the Federal Government. Some of it funds the core functions of government. Some of it is spent on things that I don't think are the core function of government, and I don't think most taxpayers around the country do either, when you say this money is being returned, but it is not. As long as we are running a deficit, which is now 2, $300  billion, then the money is borrowed to pay for projects like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply don't think that we are giving the taxpayer a fair shake. I think we should stubbornly refuse to fund this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the amendment would prevent $200,000 from being used to fund the Huntsville Museum of Art in Huntsville, Alabama, and would reduce the cost of the bill by a corresponding amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there are, I think, 480 earmarks funded in the Economic Development Initiative account, at least 11 proposed to fund museums. There stands about a million dollars total for museums. This doesn't take into account projects described as cultural centers and other various exhibits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The spending initiatives do not illustrate any sort of restraint on our part on the Federal level. In the past, we have funded Faulkner museums, teapot museums. This year we are funding museums about mules and hunting and fishing museums. The Huntsville Museum of Art was named as one of the State of Alabama's top destinations by the Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel. They bring as many as 23,000 visitors for a single exhibit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, all of us have museums in our districts. All of those museums, I'm sure, if given the opportunity, would take Federal money to defray some of their costs. We simply can't fund all of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know why we have the account in the agency. Like I said, we should go after that one, but here we have to show some restraint. And every once in a while, I think the taxpayer would appreciate if we actually stopped funding for some of these earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on behalf of this project that Mr. Flake has attacked here. I'm the offerer of this project, the Huntsville Museum of Art, located in the city of Huntsville, Alabama, the largest city in my congressional district. This is a museum project that I think is very appropriate to the economic development initiative account.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This museum chose to locate in the downtown area of the city of Huntsville some years ago. In the 1950s, early 1960s, the city of Huntsville's population was around 30,000 people. Currently its population is close to 200,000 people, but like many downtown areas, our downtown had deteriorated. It was a target for crime. It was a target for all kinds of movement there that would not have been in the best interests of the core of a city of this size.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Museum of Art chose to locate its new facility there. It partnered with the community. It raised $8 million to build this facility that it's in. It is now in another expansion because of the success of the downtown area, because  of the momentum that it helped create. Students are coming into the downtown area. People are coming into there from the region 100 miles around the area, and it's really caused the city of Huntsville to renovate and revise  its downtown area. Business is coming back, and I think in terms of economic developments issues, it's accomplishing just what it should accomplish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I'm eager to defend this amendment and say that currently the $200,000 that we've been able to achieve through the economic development initiative, through this committee, and I thank the chairman and the staff and the ranking member and the staff for considering this project, will go along with another $8 million that will be raised from the community so that we can create exhibition space, so that we can create meeting space. This is not a routine museum expansion that this $200,000 will  go toward. It's a small amount of money that will be pooled with another amount of money to renovate a downtown area that is in much need of renovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I just will close on this one, saying again this is one of many museums that we are funding here. We simply can't fund them all. At some point it would be nice to give the taxpayers a gift and actually say we're not going to fund a particular earmark. We did it a couple of weeks ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an idle process. We've had one occasion already where I've come to offer an earmark, and the sponsor of the earmark beat me to the floor and offered an amendment to revoke his own earmark. So obviously there needed to be more vetting of that earmark. I would assume that there are others like it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is a process we should go through. I would urge support of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I don't want to get into the debate on this specific project, but I again want to simply note that I find it interesting that the gentleman from Arizona is questioning small economic development programs in other States when, in fact, as I said earlier, the second largest earmark in the history of the Congress is the Central Arizona Project, upon which we have already spent not $4.3 million, but $4.3 billion, total cost estimated to be $5.6 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also have in my hand, as a certain Senator from my own State used to say, 61 pages of military contracts that are let to firms in Arizona. We don't have in our State something like Fort Huachuca or Luke or Davis Air Force Base, and I'm sure that if we did, we would be experiencing the benefit to our economy that the gentleman's State is experiencing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I wonder if the gentleman has any idea what the $44,000 was spent on in a contract with Two Pals and a Gal?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no clue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't either. It would be interesting to find out. That's another expenditure in Arizona.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would further yield for a minute, perhaps the gentleman wasn't on the floor last week. I actually challenged an earmark that was going largely to my own district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arizona is just like other States in this regard. I don't object to projects that go through the process. I assume that the Central Arizona Project had a hearing or two. It was authorized and went through the process. What I object to is the contemporary practice of earmarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Taking back my time, I was here when we went through all of that with the Central Arizona Project, and I assure you that the project was not approved because of the merits. It was approved because of the persistence of the Arizona delegation, and if anyone thinks that a little politics didn't go into determining that $4.5 billion project, I'd like to sell them a couple of bridges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, all I can say is it is fine for someone who comes from a district as prosperous as yours to belittle or question these modest economic development efforts that are being provided around the country in districts that have a per family income of $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 less than yours. This is, after all, one country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just as I believe that the most fortunate human beings in this country ought to be willing to extend a helping hand for those who are least fortunate, I also think that those communities that are well off ought to be able to extend a helping hand to the communities that are less well off, and that certainly is the case with the number of the economic development projects that this committee is trying to fund, recognizing that we are, after all, all one country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400084" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, just briefly in close, this is a modest economic development initiative. It's very appropriate under this account, and it will allow this museum project to revitalize an area of downtown that is in much need of revitalization.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, just once I would love to hear the other side say, we have no objection to that amendment and will accept it, but I suppose I won't be so lucky today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would prevent $100,000 in funding for the Hunting and Fishing Museum in Pennsylvania and reduce the cost of the bill by a corresponding amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my staff and I have never had a hard time fishing for earmarks that seem to be fiscally irresponsible, but this one seemed to be a particularly easy catch. It seems that there is no museum that we will not fund. We have funded teapot museums. We've funded mule museums. We have funded rock and roll halls of fame. Now, we're being asked to fund a museum honoring the time-honored hobbies of hunting and fishing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the earmark description, the earmark would fund the development and creation of interactive, educational and historical exhibits. According to the Web site for the Hunting and Fishing Museum, the museum came as a result of its location in a forest area of Pennsylvania where hunting and fishing are already big industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I enjoy fishing and hunting as much as the next person, but I'm not convinced that the Federal Government has a role here. I'd like to have explained what the Federal nexus is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the National Association for Sporting Goods, the hunting industry did $2.8 billion in business sales in 2004. For fiscal year 2003, the fishing industry's retail sales totaled over $40 billion. With these kind of profits, why are these industries relying on the Federal Government to fund a museum honoring their pastimes? Are we not picking winners and losers when we select only a handful of museums to fund? Is this a fair and equitable process?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than that, more than being equitable, some say if everybody is given the chance and there's an account to do this, that it's okay, that it's justified, everybody's getting theirs, let me get mine. But I think, particularly for us on this side of the aisle who say that we believe in limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, it seems a particularly hard sell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm not making fun of the hobbies of hunting and fishing. As I mentioned, I do a fair amount of both myself. But here I just fail to see a Federal nexus and a Federal role.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I find it ironic today the maker of this amendment represents one of the more affluent parts of America, one of the parts of America that wouldn't be there, wouldn't be growing and prospering without billions and billions of Federal investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can start with the 336-mile diversion canal that diverts water from the Colorado River so they can irrigate the desert and make it a city. It seems to me that's a pretty expensive economic development project taking desert and making it grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mesa last year, his home area, $35 million of their budget is Federal money, and he keeps talking about the process. Well, I think I understand the process, and I'd be glad to debate the process with him any day, anytime, anywhere. I've been in business all my life, retailing. I served in local government 8 years, State government 19 years, Federal Government 11 years, and I understand process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rural America is not a part of the process of funds from the Federal Government. This bureaucracy you brag about how they allocate money and how they hand it out as if this was some pure process. Rural communities don't have planning departments. They don't have planning directors. They don't have consultants. They don't hire lobbyists like Mesa and Phoenix and Arizona do. They're fighting for their economic lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This little forest county is less than 10,000 people. I think the population went from close to 5,500 to 7,500 because we opened a prison there. It used to be the home of an Evenflo Bottle Company, and those people would like to see a little investment in economic development in that community. It used to be the home of a glass plant. It used to be the home of a cabinet factory. They're all gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a beautiful area, some of the most beautiful parts of America. It is the best hunting and fishing in America, and tourism is the only tool they have that's working. This Hunting and Fishing Museum is another tool to try to keep hunters and fishermen and travelers and visitors to visit that part of the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another thing, its interactive displays teach young people about hunting and fishing. We have a lot of people today that don't have fathers at home teaching them to hunt and fish. The Hunting and Fishing Museum is going to have classes. They're going to have classrooms. They're going to teach young people the joy of hunting and fishing. I find you take a young man and you teach him to fish, you teach him to hunt, you get him involved in a sport, he's less likely to be in crimes, drugs and on  the streets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a part of the fiber of America. There is no urban museum that isn't loaded with Federal dollars to build it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Rural museums don't have that same pathway. I defy a museum in America that doesn't have Federal funding in it. Because a little community asks for 50 or 100,000, this is some sort of a crime?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm sorry. I'm not going to apologize. I served Forest County as a State House member, a State senator and now a Congressman. I ran a business within 10 miles, and many of these people were customers of mine when I had a supermarket. These are good people fighting for their economic lives trying to build this museum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State has allocated $4 million, but they have to get matching money. This $100,000 will get them another $100,000 from the State, because as they raise money, they get money. I gladly debate this museum. It's a good investment for the future for Forest County and for America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, nobody is suggesting that it is a crime to support this kind of earmark, nor would it be a crime to actually deny funding for it. That's what the process is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My complaint, and nobody has suggested either, that there's this pure process at the Federal agency level. It's dysfunctional. We haven't provided the type of oversight that we need to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that there is an account over there to actually fund economic development projects suggests to me that it's out of control, that that's what we are about, what we should be about. We control the Federal purse strings. It should be in our interest actually to rein in spending over there rather than trying to compete with it and say if they do effect spending on this project or that, whomever has the district, that we shouldn't compete with that here and say, well, we can do one, one-up  them with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If they had funded another hall of fame, we should say, is it the Federal Government's role to fund these? That's what I am questioning here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we can fund teapot museums and mule museums and hunting and fishing museums, what is off limits? What would come here that we could say we are not going to fund that? We could fund a mule museum. How about a donkey museum. Is that out of line? Where do we say enough is enough, and where do we say let's give the taxpayer a break?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>According to the Department of Transportation in 2005, his area received $580 million for its construction of a $1.4 billion, that's a pretty big percentage, of a 19.6 mile light rail system serving metropolitan Phoenix.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why should people from Forest County have to pay that? I should make that argument. We can use it. Mass transit gets huge amounts of money, and Arizona gets lots of that. The largesse goes to the urban areas that have the ability to get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing about the earmark process, I am not saying it's perfect, but I have  never asked for an earmark that I wouldn't defend publicly in any setting. I am proud today to ask this Congress to give $100,000 to the Hunting and Fishing Museum in little Forest County, that is trying to rebuild their economic base, enhance their tourism and teach our young people the value of wildlife and fishing and hunting and the beauty of the area. That's a noble issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will gladly support the ability to help that rural county. I ask support of this Congress for this earmark.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would take $300,000 from the Friends of the Cheat Rails-to-Trails program. The Cheat Trail is one small part of the 13,600 miles of trails built by the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. The program's mission is to create a nationwide network of trails for former rail lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program is a nationwide effort, yet this earmark is aimed directly at one trail in West Virginia. This is not the first time Friends of Cheat have bypassed the Rails-to-Trails program for funding. The House approved a $300,000 earmark for the Cheat trail just last year. If the trail is in such need of funding, isn't it coming from the funding and the many grants allocated in the Rails-to-Trails program?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is another problem I have with the contemporary practice of earmarking. If we set up processes at the Federal agency level, and we set up accounts, often when people apply to that account, and apply for a grant and don't get it, then we in Congress will go and give them that project anyway through an earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we are telling the Federal agencies, here is a process that you should go through that is merit based, that is competition based, and then fund those who don't get a contract, what are we saying? If we have a problem with a Federal agency's process or program, then we should amend them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should change them. We should call the agency heads before us and say explain why are you doing this, why are you giving money to this organization and not that one, but not to circumvent the process and basically add to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rails-to-Trails program has over 100,000 members, receives Federal, State and private funding. It was created over 20 years ago. I think that if this organization was to apply to the program, they are quite capable of finding funding. There is funding there.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400281" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in a way, I hardly know where to start here, but I might start with the gentleman's question that he poses time and time again, not only today but in previous days: Is it the Federal Government's role to fund these projects?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has several different arguments against projects. When projects of a very significant nature are pointed out that are going on in his district, he says, oh, well, in the past they were authorized, appropriated, and he says they have oversight. To what extent, we don't know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the point is, they went through a process here in Congress. Article I, section 7 doesn't say what process it should go through. It says that it's the Congress' job to do that. Every Member of this body is looking at their congressional district and thinking about economic developments and what are the needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are in a transition economy, transitioning from a basic industry, manufacturing economy to a new economy, tourism is a very important part of that new economy, of that vision into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen a lot of projects from industrial areas that fall into that category, whether they are museums, whether they are trails, whether they are any of those kinds of appurtenances, if you will, that contribute to the economic development in the tourism realm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, if the gentleman's question is, is it the government's role, the Federal Government's role, to fund these projects, which he asks over and over again, as the alternative argument against these projects, then it has been answered over and over and over again. It is the Federal Government's role to do it through this body. Constitutionally, it is our responsibility. Article I makes that very clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just want to point that out and then speak and thank the gentleman for the opportunity to stand up to speak for Friends of Cheat, because they are doing just that. They are laying the kind of infrastructure that is necessary and crucial to that new economy, and that aspect of our economy in the future of West Virginia is going to be tourism. He has allowed me to speak to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I speak to it, I would like to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his leadership and review of this project. I know his staff has spent hours on it, because my staff has spent hours on the projects that we have approved. But this funding will be used, as the gentleman said, to acquire land and develop a trail in order to create those kinds of infrastructure that are attractive and make usable the bounty that is West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for allowing me the opportunity to speak in favor of this project. I want to compliment him for the tremendous assets that are going into Arizona. I am extremely impressed; it's an affluent area. His predecessors have worked very hard, as has been pointed out here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing the matter with that, and there is nothing the matter with the process that those projects went through. Nor is there anything the matter with the projects that we are talking about here today have gone through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for bringing this amendment, and I appreciate the gentleman from West Virginia coming down to defend this particular language that's here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we need to take a look at this thing from a perspective that's perhaps broader than this particular project, that being that the issues that have been raised here in this Congress will be discussed again and again throughout this appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if the project has merit, it should have merit. It should be able to succeed in its efforts without being specifically identified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think it has a fair amount of weight to drag with it, in that that trail has been there a long time. It could wait awhile longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would submit that the issues that surround the particular district that the gentleman represents should be considered in light of this particular appropriation. The report that came out in the Wall Street Journal that's a little more than a year old, about land that has been purchased along the river that happens to be the same river that this trail runs along, I don't know that it's adjacent, brings a question to mind as to whether or not the gentleman  from  West Virginia will be able to follow through on statements reported in the Wall Street Journal that say any claim whatsoever that says these investments are in any way related to my actions as a Member of Congress is categorically false.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't deny that statement. I don't actually take issue with that. I would just ask the gentleman if he could suspend his aggressive effort to fund this project until such time as these questions that surround this Cheat River project could be resolved.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me just close. Let me say, again, I fail to see the relevance of the number of defense contractors that Arizona has or the amount of Federal money that goes there by contract, by competitive bid or otherwise. How is that relevant to this process?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, there is something wrong with the process when we have thousands and thousands and thousands of earmarks, when we have 1,500 and just a couple of days to review them before we come here to the floor. There is something wrong with that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said before, we can try all we want to conjure up some justification for the contemporary practice of earmarking. But if we think the taxpayers across the country are buying it, we are drinking our own bath water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are believing our own press releases if we think that's the case, because they're not. They're not believing it, and they shouldn't. There is no noble pedigree to this kind of earmarking. There really isn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to appropriate money in this fashion is simply not becoming of this Congress. We are better than that. We should have more respect for the institution than that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would prohibit $300,000 in Federal funds from being used by the Houston Zoo in Houston, Texas, for an educational broadcast program and would reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the earmark description in this certification letter, this funding would be used to develop an educational broadcast program to provide interactive distance learning, first to the neighboring institutions at the Texas Medical Center, and ultimately expanding the program to regional school districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the sponsor's letter, this program would enable children and students to ask questions of and converse with zoo experts in real time, replicating an in-classroom dynamic, but in an exciting and unique manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should say the Houston Zoo is the permanent home of 4,500 animals; the zoo attracts more than 1.5 million visitors a year; general admission is $10 for an adult, $5 for a child. In fact, according to the City Navigator, annual revenue for the Houston Zoo in 2006 totaled $39 billion. In 2006 alone, the Houston Zoo had over $43 million in net assets and nearly $20 million in excess revenue. It has a membership base of over 28,000 households. Corporate sponsors include Continental Airlines, Shell  Oil, JPMorgan, BMC Software, Conoco-Phillips, FedEx. The list goes on and on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, here, if we are going to start to fund programs at zoos like this, where does it end? Virtually every Member has a zoo or some type of wildlife preserve in their district. Where do we say enough is enough?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of the time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Here again, let me simply say there are a lot of zoos around the country, a lot of zoos that every one of which would like to receive Federal funding. Where do we say enough is enough? Where do we say this zoo is worthy, they have two tigers; this one only has one lion? The tigers get it? I mean, where do we have some kind of equitable process rather than Members just being able to designate funding of this type? We simply cannot continue to go on in this fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, somebody will probably point out Arizona has a lot of defense contractors and gets a lot of Federal money. Again, I fail to see the relevance of that argument here. Let's throw the taxpayers a bone here, if you will, and let's finally say we are going to stop funding for one of these earmarks and actually return to fiscal sanity. We are running between a $200 billion and $300 billion deficit this year. Remember, money comes into Washington, we don't have enough to fund the programs, and  so we are borrowing money to actually pay for programs like this. We can't continue to do that. I urge support for the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400089" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am not sure what standard the gentleman from Arizona follows, but as a member of the Appropriations Committee, as a guardian of the public Treasury, representing the people of Houston, I have approached all spending requests from the perspective as someone who has a second mortgage on the house and all the credit cards are topped out. My starting answer on all spending requests is "no," and "yes" has to be earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have published all of my appropriations requests on my Web site for many years. I published both my request letters as well as the final result of those requests that the members of the committee have graciously agreed to support because they know that any request coming from me and my office has already been carefully screened. I won't submit requests that haven't already passed my very careful scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I approach the request from the perspective of there is not enough money in the Treasury to do it; the starting answer is "no," and "yes" has to be earned; the request has to fall within the functions of the Federal Government, and it has to be something for which there is no other source of revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to represent the Texas Medical Center. I am proud to represent the Houston Zoo. This $300,000 will be used by the zoo. They are matching it, providing a 3-1 private match to these dollars that are going to go exclusively into providing live video feeds to critically ill children and children that are dying of cancer who otherwise would have no interaction with the outside world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Texas Medical Center is recognized around the world as probably the greatest concentration of medical talent anywhere in the world. God forbid anybody within the sound of my voice comes down with cancer or a dreaded disease; but if they do, there is no better place to find a cure for that than at the Texas Medical Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are a child with terrible burns, trapped in your room and unable to get out and visit the zoo personally, there  is no television channel in Houston for you to see what goes on at the zoo. The zoo is going to use these dollars to construct dedicated transmission facilities to these dying children, critically ill children in their hospital rooms so they can talk to the feeders, people actually working with the animals, observe the animals around  the clock. And, certainly, your mental attitude is a tremendous part of getting well and recovering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This request was the only one that I submitted on behalf of the Houston Zoo. They submitted a lot of requests to me. In fact, I think the appropriators will find that most of the requests from me will take about one page, because I am very careful and only submit a very few. I am proud of all of them. They are all on my Web site. And I can tell you, this is one that I am very grateful to the chairman Mr. Olver and to the ranking member Mr. Knollenberg for supporting. They know  they don't get many requests from me, and this one certainly is one that is appropriate to help these dying and critically ill children revive their spirits in interacting with and seeing what marvelous work the Houston Zoo is doing, which is, of course, right next door to the Texas Medical Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to encourage Members to vote against this amendment based on the merits, but then also because the amendment doesn't save any money. I am one of the most fiscally conservative Members of this House and proud of it. I voted against all of these big new spending programs over the last many years, whether it be the farm bill; I voted against the farm bill, billions of dollars for AIDS in Africa as money we don't have; voted against the No Child Left Behind because that is an intrusion  of the 10th amendment sovereignty of the States and money we can't afford to spend; voted against the Medicare prescription drug program. I have voted against most of the big spending programs that have been driven through this House, because I truly believe that I have got a responsibility to my daughter and future generations to try to keep Federal spending at a minimum, diminish the size, power, and cost to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Jefferson, my hero, said, apply core republican principles, with a small "R," keeping most power and responsibility at the local level. If you apply core republican principles, the knot will always untie itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am always looking for ways to save money. So I would ask Members to vote against this amendment first on the merits; and then, secondly, because unfortunately, once again, Mr. Flake's amendment doesn't save any money. He is not reducing the overall 302(a) allocation of the bill. So this is another phantom savings that is not going to result in a savings of one nickel for taxpayers by cutting out the live video feeds to these dying and critically ill children in the medical center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am sick and tired of phony amendments that act like they are going to save money. I have already scrutinized this, along with every other request from my office. I am proud of the work the zoo is doing and the work the medical center is doing. And you can expect me to be out here vigorously defending the work of this committee investing in the sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank you, Chairman Obey. The chairman of my Subcommittee on the Sciences, Mr. Mollohan, is here. Our ranking member, Mr. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. God bless them for the investments they are making into sciences and NASA and medical and scientific research. That is our Nation's insurance policy. I will be out here vigorously defending them against anyone attempting to cut those investments into sciences or NASA or in medical research. That is this Nation's insurance  policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I especially resent somebody coming out here and offering a phony amendment that is not going to save one nickel of taxpayer money; because this $300,000 is not being taken out of the overall spending, it is just going to be spent by bureaucrats.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, again, I do not want to comment on the particular project under question, but, again, I just want to make a point to my friend from Arizona. And I love the State of Arizona. It is a beautiful State. I go there every year to visit some friends. I think it is absolutely wonderful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when I came to this Congress, I believe there were four congressional districts in Arizona, four Representatives of Arizona in this House, and there were 10 Representatives from the State of Wisconsin. Now, almost 40 years later, Wisconsin has eight congressional districts, eight Representatives, and Arizona, I believe, has a similar number. That means that Arizona has grown at an incredibly rapid rate, and an awful lot of money from a lot of other States has helped finance that economic  growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I return to the Central Arizona Project. I am not expressing a judgment about that project one way or the other, but I do know that it is one of the two or three most expensive earmarks in history. And I would simply suggest that I find it ironic that the gentleman has chosen to go after several projects today in States whose economies are far less prosperous than the gentleman's own State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would question whether or not there is any greater purity in a highway, for instance, being built on the basis of a determination by two or three persons from a given State that knows the area, I don't know why that is any less pure than to have some partisan bureaucrat in the agency decide.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Chair asks the gentleman from Wisconsin to suspend for one moment.</chair>
  <chair>Pursuant to the Chair's announcement of earlier today, the Committee will now observe a moment of silence in memory of Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson.</chair>

  <chair>The gentleman from Wisconsin may continue.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="MOMENT OF SILENCE OBSERVED IN MEMORY OF OFFICER JACOB J. CHESTNUT AND DETECTIVE JOHN M. GIBSON">
    <paragraph>As I was saying, I don't know why one should assume that a decision to build a highway or any other project, if made by partisan bureaucrats or politically appointed bureaucrats in an agency, I don't know why that is any more pure than a decision being made out in the open by Members of Congress, who I think know their districts as well as any bureaucrat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So all I would suggest is that while I am certainly not fond of the earmarking process, I am also not fond of the idea that somehow those of us from States not quite as prosperous as the gentleman's need to be embarrassed by the fact that we are asking for a little better deal in terms of Federal money spent in our districts, especially when the gentleman's State is above the national average in terms of the amount of Federal dollars spent in his own State.</paragraph>

  <chair> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</chair>
  <chair> Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to eliminate, consolidate, de-consolidate, co-locate, execute inter-facility reorganization, or plan for the consolidation/deconsolidation, inter-facility reorganization, or co-location of any FAA air traffic control facility or service, with the exception of the reversal of the transfer of the radar functions from the Palm Springs Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) to the Southern California  TRACON.</chair>

  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today with Representatives Poe, Filner, and Bono to offer an amendment prohibiting the Federal Aviation Administration from eliminating, consolidating, colocating, or planning to consolidate or colocate any terminal radar approach control center, or TRACON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment is virtually identical to the amendment that was overwhelmingly approved by the House in a bipartisan fashion by almost 100 votes just last June. Yet, since the House went on record of opposing further consolidation, the FAA has done virtually nothing to address our concerns. Even more, it has accelerated its consolidation efforts while shutting out stakeholders from the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the TRACON system guides airplanes within a 50-mile radius of the airport on their takeoffs and final approaches. The FAA has embarked on an ambitious consolidation and colocation plan which will significantly limit our air traffic capacities in the future. I warn that this policy is shortsighted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is now rumored that the FAA's current consolidation proposal seeks to eliminate or consolidate nearly 50 TRACONs in over 30 States across the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In some instances, entire States will be left without any approach radar system within their borders. In other instances, consolidation runs the risk of placing undue stress on nearby TRACONs already having to deal with larger airspaces and staffing shortfalls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Florida, the FAA is planning to consolidate the TRACONs of Miami International, Ft. Lauderdale International and Palm Beach International airports into one TRACON. Note that all three of these airports are within a Federal high-risk urban area, and smack dab in the heart of Hurricane Alley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once this plan is implemented, if a terrorist attack or natural disaster were to strike the Miami TRACON, then all three international airports would lose their approach radar system. Controllers in Jacksonville, an airport more than 350 miles away, will be forced to direct approaching aircraft throughout virtually the entire State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Realize, Mr. Chairman, this is not a question of whether or not consolidation can technologically be done. It can be done and it is being done. On the contrary, this is a question of should it be done and what risk is Congress willing to run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, in the instances where consensus is possible and consolidation could be appropriate, the FAA is still refusing to involve stakeholders in the process. To that end, this amendment appropriately exempts the TRACONs of Palm Springs and southern California from the limitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opponents of our amendment likely will argue that the construction of some new control facilities, including one in my district, will be delayed and funds lost if we do not allow consolidation. To them I say, why can't we keep those funds available until all stakeholders can reach a viable solution? Congress does it all the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some point to the FAA authorization bill as the appropriate place to address this issue. And I have great respect for the chairman of that committee with whom I've had a conversation. If that's the case, though, why do we keep throwing money at the problem in this bill? At the very least, we should tie this money to smart policy and a transparent process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA's TRACON consolidation runs the grave risk of leaving our air traffic system vulnerable during critical times and setting a dangerous precedent for a process that excludes stakeholders from decisions that impact their lives. This is not a risk that Congress should be willing to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the major problem, other than lack of funds, related to aviation in this country for the next period of time is the great growth in traffic. We are expecting total traffic to pass 1 billion passengers within the next 10 years. Over the last 10 years it has risen from, gone well above 500 million passengers per year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this amendment will make the cost of providing facilities and equipment in order to be able to meet that great growth in traffic much higher than it otherwise would be. The modern equipment that is necessary, most of the present towers need to be upgraded, the equipment needs to be upgraded, towers need to be built for the next generation of air traffic control to deal with all of that huge increase in expected traffic. The towers themselves are expensive. The electronic equipment, the facilities,  what you call the STARS systems for control, all of these are expensive items, and the expense of the process burgeons if we do not make other kinds of efficiencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this amendment would halt all of the modernization of air traffic control facilities, both TRACONs and towers, and the equipment within those facilities. Consolidation has already gone on very successfully in some parts of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Florida has suggested that there are problems in safety, potential problems in safety. Look, in California they have consolidated to now two TRACONs covering the whole State for the 30-plus million people in California and the roughly 40 commercial air systems, airports that are there. So that kind of consolidation has gone on also in New York, also in Chicago, also in Atlanta, in all of those places, some of the most complicated air traffic systems in the country. The most  complicated ones have already been undergoing consolidations, and this proposal would stop that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would cost us $85 million in savings from planned and designed and in construction consolidations that are already in process. It would cost another $110 million in funds which would expire, because funds for FAA facilities and equipment goes on a 3-year cycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there would be $225 million in construction funds that will be placed on hold. It is an extremely costly endeavor, and it is generally wrongheaded, really. We have to have this consolidation because it's critical to the efficient dealing with our movement of air traffic in this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Without a great deal of enthusiasm, I oppose the amendment of the gentleman, although I supported it last year. But this year we have in place in our FAA reauthorization bill a process that will cure the problem the gentleman has brought to the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, the FAA has not been responsive to the gentleman from Florida. Worse, they have been dismissive. They have not consulted with him or with his airport or with the community that he represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the legislation that the gentleman from Illinois, chairman of the subcommittee and I have fashioned with bipartisan support, we have a process in place. Once our authorization bill is enacted, that will require the FAA to consult with communities, with airport authorities, with the Members of Congress on these consolidation proposals and report back to the Congress. We'll get another crack at it. We'll do it in due course and due appropriate process, not the way FAA is proposing to do it,  certainly not with a base-closing commission approach that the administration offered to the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just today the gentleman from Illinois held a hearing on the wretched conditions in a great many of our air traffic control facilities, which the FAA is ignoring under the guise of modernization of air traffic control system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, come on. That's not happening for another 5 to 10 years. Meanwhile, people have to sit there and suffer through mold and rain and mildew and, in northern Minnesota, in my district in Duluth, snow coming through the windows, or flies in the air traffic control tower in the winter. Come on. That's not taking care of our facilities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I, too, am opposed to this amendment. A number of planned and paid-for capital improvement projects will be delayed or completely cancelled if this amendment goes through.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I'm pleased to join Mr. Oberstar who chairs our committee, and as the ranking member, and you'll hear from our ranking member on the Aviation Subcommittee, also opposed to this amendment and, I believe, Mr. Costello, who's the Chair of the Aviation Subcommittee, which I previously chaired, is opposed to this amendment. So rarely have we had such bipartisan support in opposing an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Oberstar said, too, maybe this may be well-intended to try to deal with some problems we've had in the past, but let me tell you, this amendment can have some very severe consequences. We're talking about closing down the modernization of our air traffic control system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here's the headline of today's Washington Times: "FAA Target Airline Delays." I can't come to the floor and not be besieged by Members who haven't been delayed by flights. If you really want to close down our Nation's aviation system, pass this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have successfully done these consolidations in the past. We'll do them and modernize and get the latest equipment. However, a moratorium on consolidations through January of 2009 will cause FAA to lose $110 million of expiring funds this year that are targeted toward modernizing these facilities, and nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in construction costs will be placed on hold for projects currently in process across the country. This would be a disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the airports affected are planning to make improvements, and all of this attempt to get our aviation industry moving and air traffic moving and modernization of the system will come to a grinding halt. May be well-intended, may try to solve a problem that the gentleman from Florida has experienced, but this is not the solution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I join with my colleagues on the committee who have studied this matter in opposing the amendment before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this morning the Aviation Subcommittee conducted a hearing on our aging air traffic control facilities, some of which are in very, very bad condition, and this amendment would move us in the wrong direction rather than the right direction. The impact of the amendment would be, according to the FAA, that it would lose some $110 million in funds that have been programmed to modernize the facilities that it needs to maintain to keep our system moving. And this will expire if the amendment is  adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average age of FAA towers is some 27 years and in route centers are 43 years. They need to spend some $30 billion over the next few years to modernize the facilities and maintain them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I realize that it's a well-meaning amendment, but it would set us back and delay the efficiency and mobility of our population, and could even result in some increase in risk in the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons, I would urge rejection of the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am strongly a proponent of this amendment. I represent southeast Texas. We have a TRACON at Houston Intercontinental Airport. We have one in Beaumont, 90 miles away. And I am not convinced that the consolidation of these two TRACONs in Houston is a good idea for safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also concerned about the fact that we have more and more planes in the air, but yet the FAA wants to have fewer and fewer facilities in the United States to control that aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also concerned, as the gentleman from Florida is, about security. Down in southeast Texas, what I represent, I represent the number one refinery in the United States, the number two refinery in the United States. Twenty-two percent of the Nation's aviation fuel is produced in my area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And if there was some tragic event, some terrorist attack on Houston and the Intercontinental Airport, who would be controlling the skies? Some TRACON unit in Oklahoma City and New Mexico? I think not. I think it is good that we have two TRACONs in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, lastly, I am not convinced that this would save any money. Just as we went through with the BRAC military base closures, we are finding that that did not save the taxpayers any money, especially with Ellington Field in Houston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for all those reasons I think this is a wise amendment for safety and security, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400170" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, going forward, my colleagues argue that we would lose $110 million that expires at the end of this year for FAA. I remind my colleagues that this is the United States Congress, and I have been here when we have extended the kinds of funds that would be made allocable to agencies by time. If we wanted to, the $110 million that has been discussed could be extended for 2 or 3 years, and FAA could be delayed in that particular undertaking with reference to so-called modernization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What they did in this particular measure, after we passed the measure last year, FAA then accelerated their process rather than sitting down and talking with the stakeholders such as the Members of Congress or pilots or air traffic controllers or airport operators or aviation operators and the general public; absolutely no discussion, and then put forward the measures that have come out now. That is the primary reason that I am on the floor. Sixteen thousand controllers and engineers believe  this to be the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the Record I will include a letter from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION, AFL-CIO,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 23, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote Yes on the Hastings-Poe-Filner-Bono Amendment to THUD Appropriations</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: As the President of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), representing over 16,000 controllers, engineers, architects, nurses and aviation safety professionals, I urge you to vote yes on the Hastings-Poe-Filner-Bono amendment to <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill>, the FY08 Transportation Appropriations Act. Representative Alcee Hastings offered a very similar amendment to last year's TTHUD bill to prevent the FAA from consolidating Terminal Approach Control (TRACON)  facilities, and it passed with 261 bipartisan votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, NATCA and the FAA have worked in tandem to identify air traffic control facility consolidations that could potentially make sense and to ensure that the process involves the important input from vital stakeholders. Unfortunately, the FAA is no longer taking into consideration the legitimate concerns of stakeholders such as Members of Congress, pilots, air traffic controllers, airport operators, aviation operators, and the general public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NATCA believes that the FAA must consider air traffic control facility consolidations/colocations using a transparent process  because the Agency has an obligation to involve stakeholders in any Agency effort that could affect the safety and efficiency of the airspace. A full risk-assessment, including the Homeland Security implications of placing all of our radar functions in one location, must be conducted and made open to public scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A moratorium on consolidations is necessary to provide the opportunity for Congress to evaluate the specific operational need for proposed consolidations and prevent the Agency from moving ahead with flawed consolidation plans without a defined policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope that you will support the efforts of our nation's professional air traffic control workforce in keeping our National Airspace System the safest in the world by supporting this amendment. Vote yes on Hastings-Poe-Filner-Bono.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400082" topic="NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the Hastings amendment, joining the chairman of the full committee, Chairman Oberstar; the ranking member Mr. Mica; and Mr. Petri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hastings is exactly right. The FAA has done a very poor job of communicating with Members of Congress and stakeholders on its plans to consolidate and relocate facilities, but halting the process at this stage is not the answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, what we need is an open, continuous, and defined process, and that is exactly what we have in the reauthorization bill that the Transportation Committee passed just a few weeks ago. It allows affected stakeholders to work together with the FAA to develop criteria and make recommendations that will be submitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register for proper review and oversight. Any objections or changes made to the recommendations must again be submitted to the Congress.  Congress does not relinquish its role, but, instead, can provide thorough review, oversight, and input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that preventing consolidation and relocation is not the answer. We just held a hearing this morning, the Aviation Subcommittee, in which we discussed the FAA's aging traffic control facilities. Many of these facilities are 40 years old or older, and they are exceeding their useful life expectancy in not meeting current operational requirements. This has resulted in the GAO's giving many of the facilities a score of fair to poor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must ensure that the FAA make the investments needed to maintain the current existing infrastructure, including in some cases consolidation and relocation, to ensure that the current system can continue to operate in a safe and reliable way. I believe the best course of action is to address this issue through the reauthorization bill, and that is exactly what we have done in passing the bill out of committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the Hastings amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out that the gentleman from Florida has made the point that the House passed last year legislation doing this. That was never acted upon and was not included in the CR, the final CR for the 2007 budget. That was adopted in the House version of the bill, but it was not carried through to the CR. So there is no precedent of merit there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the crux of our problem is that we have a huge growth of air traffic that is expected within a 20-year period. From 1995 to the year 2015, we will have gone from half a billion passengers to a billion passengers, and that is in the commercial traffic, plus all of the increase in general aviation. We cannot sit with our head in the sand and not modernize all these facilities, the towers, the facilities, the equipment, the control systems that are necessary to deal with that increase  in traffic, and that has to be done. It has already been done in some of our major parts of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Texas has concerns about Texas. The authorizing language which the T&amp;I Committee has reported out includes a system to look at those cases to review and to set up a system for reviewing how those systems will be set up in additional places as the consolidation of TRACONs and the modernization of these facilities and the reequipment of these facilities must go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think that that part of it is a red herring, truly. In the case of Chicago and New York and Philadelphia and Washington and California, our heaviest traffic locations in the country, and Atlanta besides, we already have these consolidations in place. And in the case of California, 40-some-odd airports and their tower facilities have been included now in 2 TRACONs where there used to be 8 or more TRACONs in the State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the number of TRACONs is going to come down. It must come down, and we must get on with this modernization of the facilities and equipment that otherwise would always be very costly. It must be done.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to come to the floor today with my colleague from New Jersey, Morristown, and also my other colleague here as well from Connecticut, CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, as we propose an amendment that will ask the FAA to basically more closely consider how their proposed airspace redesign plan will impact upon the quality of life of the residents of the State of New Jersey, from Connecticut, and also from the State of New York as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we all recognize that the skies over our area are more crowded than ever before, and air travel is, obviously, a worthy goal. But the FAA must make noise and air pollution a top consideration whenever they work to redesign their airspace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Residents of the communities across the five States are facing a threat now to the quiet of their communities and also to the value of their homes as well. The residents of my area, the Fifth District of New Jersey, are especially concerned about this. Just recently we held what you call a town meeting of sorts, and nearly 1,500 people came out to the public hearing up in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, and that was just about a month ago. And they came out to voice their concerns directly to the  FAA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA received comments from all present, but wouldn't it have been a lot better if the FAA had taken those comments before they drafted their preferred alternative? The citizens who came to that meeting left with a deep concern that the FAA just is not listening. So this amendment is really here to help force the FAA to listen to those people in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as noise in these communities increases, there is a very real possibility that the values of their homes are going to decrease. Residents are concerned their communities are going to be drastically affected by the fact that the FAA is simply trying to save 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes from the travelers' air time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in conclusion, we are simply asking now through this amendment that the FAA reconsider their preferred alternative with an eye towards protecting the communities and considering that at the same time that they consider the air travelers as well.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this and the previous amendment go together. Together, if these two amendments pass, our air traffic control system will be set back years in the process from which they have been going forward in trying to modernize both the air traffic design and the TRACON facilities to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA has spent more than $50 million on airspace redesign in the New York, Philadelphia, New Jersey, western Connecticut area already. They have posted hundreds of outreach meetings to understand the needs and concerns. In addition, the design has undergone independent analysis by the inspector general throughout the process, and the FAA has adopted each of the IG's recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what are the benefits, what are the purposes of the airspace redesign? Well, number one, we have got this huge expected increase in traffic that I have already spoken to twice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the air traffic region that is being described here, and this amendment only affects that region, not the whole country, only that region, but that air traffic system, that airspace system, is the system where the greatest delays, the greatest delays, are happening as we speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The redesign of the airspace would allow for a major reduction in delays, first of all. By so doing, there would be less noise. They would be able to fly at higher altitudes, and use a gradual glide pattern in rather than stepwise glide patterns in, and use the whole airspace so that the net reduction of people who are affected by noise, by the levels of noise, is very large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, environmentally if you are not flying around for long periods of time in the airspace and under delay and in holding patterns and sitting on the tarmac with the engines going, then you are saving a lot of fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There will be much less fuel burned, therefore, much better air quality control in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these taken together, along with the fact that if you've got delays in that major area where so much traffic occurs, then there are backups with delays all over the country. So the air space design issue is a critical issue in totality for our modernization of our traffic control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I oppose the amendment, and I hope it will not be adopted.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia metropolitan area has the most complex air space in the United States; that means, the most complex air space in the world. Four of the Nation's five airports reporting the worst on-time performance are Newark, LaGuardia, JFK and Philadelphia. Holding time is five times greater than any place in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The percentage of flights that arrive in Newark over an hour late is 15 percent of all the fights. Seventy-five percent of the Nation's domestic and international flights are affected by delays and inefficiencies in the New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia air space, no matter where they're going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have international flights arriving from the transatlantic corridor. You have flights arriving from Canada, flights arriving from South America, flights arriving transcontinental from the United States on the east coast merging into this area. Sure, there are awful noise impacts upon residents, but the redesign will save noise to some 619,000 people, shifting it elsewhere, shifting it away from other people. FAA has held over 120 public meetings since they began the process of the air space  redesign. This will save 20 percent of delays and 12 million minutes a year. This is important to the Nation, not just to this region.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I, too, oppose the amendment. I agree that we need to do something with the problems that are out there. We have to strike a balance between our neighborhoods and our close-in airports. And I know that Mr. Garrett spoke about 1,500 people showing up for a hearing and/or town hall hearing, some kind. That's a lot of people, so there is a lot of grief and upset out there. But the traffic delays of the New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania airports, as has been pointed  out by Mr. Oberstar, are the worst in history, and I think it's less than 50 percent of the flights were on time. The FAA does need to act.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It is, again, rare that we have the chairmen on both sides of the aisle, the appropriation and authorizing committee, all uniformly in opposition to an amendment. But let me tell you, if you want to close down air traffic in the United States indefinitely in the Northeast, adopt this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this isn't something that we just cooked up, that we're going to redesign the air space in the Northeast corridor. We started on this in 1998. We haven't redesigned the air corridor in the northeast United States since 1988. Imagine not expanding the roads or the transportation system in the Northeast since 1998 and the congestion you would have, and that's exactly what we've got.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I've been to the districts. I've been to Mr. Garrett's district, Mr. Fossella's district. I've been to Mr. Shays' district. And I continue to work with Members, when I chaired the Aviation Subcommittee, and now as ranking member, and we will work with them, but we have got to redesign the air space. Imagine having no expansion highways. Now, planes are no different than highways; they run in corridors. But we haven't changed it in the Northeast corridor since 1988.  We have been working on this redesign since 1998, some 10 years. We have got to make these changes and move forward with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we need to listen to the people. We need to make certain that we don't harm their environment, their noise levels, and take into consideration as many of the points that have been raised. But I urge you to defeat this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First of all, let me say that there is no one in this body who pays more attention and is more hardworking in defending the interests of his constituents than Mr. Frelinghuysen, the author of this amendment. But the fact of  the matter is that it's not in the national interest to stop this study in its track. They're not doing it just because they want to. They're doing it because the Nation has grown. The system is at capacity. It needs to be  redesigned to accommodate the movement of people by air through this New York region. If we don't do it, they will have to go by train, and that's almost at capacity. And the roads are congested. It will slow down our economy. It will impact and affect the growth of the whole region if this can't go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, I would urge people to defeat the amendment. We will work with the Member from New Jersey and others to make sure they're sensitive to local noise concerns, but this is not the way to do it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>For well over 15 years, I've been an advocate of reducing aircraft noise over northern New Jersey. I have attended dozens of public hearings, had meetings with FAA officials, responded to thousands of letters from constituents whose lives have been negatively affected by the existing air traffic patterns and related noise. I have been more than a proponent of a design of air space over New York and New Jersey metropolitan area, the first such redesign conducted by the FAA, but I have actually  been working on funding for this design plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me say, I respect Mr. Oberstar. I respect all of the big guns that are out against this amendment. But the issue is, and Mr. Oberstar mentioned it, is that the FAA has always been dismissive of aircraft noise concerns. We're not trying to say that we shouldn't be concerned about airline safety and too much congestion, and we don't want to do damage to our airline industry, but for those in the flight patterns now, what they propose negatively affects our constituents  in northern New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite honestly, the FAA, if you will pardon the expression, has been blowing us off for a long time. They've been dismissive. So this amendment is all about sending a wake-up call to Administrator Blakely.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise today in opposition to the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Mica said, the last comprehensive change to the air space Northeast corridor occurred in 1987 and 1988. Since that time, the traffic has grown significantly. Delays and inefficiencies in the New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia metropolitan area must be addressed as they have reached an all-time high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eighty-six percent of the delays caused by the New York center were due to the air space volume. Let me repeat that. Eighty-six percent of the delays caused by the New York center were due to air space volume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first quarter of 2007, the five airports with the worst on-time performance were Newark, LaGuardia, O'Hare, JFK and Philadelphia. Four of the five airports are part of the air space redesign. The New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia air space will handle 15 to 20 percent of all of the air traffic in the Nation by 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FAA has a specific process in place that it must follow in implementing the air space redesign. Over the course of the project, the FAA has held over 120 meetings to allow stakeholder input, many of which were not required by law. My colleagues, Mr. Andrews, Mr. Sestak and I have asked the GAO to look into the air space redesign to make sure that the FAA has followed the law in implementing this redesign. However, I do not believe that we should be halting the project at  this time. It is too critical to our system not to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should not pick winners and losers in the air space redesign debate. This amendment is asking us to do just that. And for that reason, I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400139" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and rise in strong opposition to this amendment, with much due respect to my friend and colleague from New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in large part it has been echoed, but let me repeat it. If anybody who was sitting on a runway, whether you are across this country, especially in LaGuardia or Kennedy, and in particular, Newark Airport, you would be stampeding this House to ensure that this redesign go through. The reason being, as has been detailed extensively, and who knows it better than the riding public, is that congestion is at all all-time high and only will get worse unless this plan is put in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second, and perhaps I would, quote, in clean hands talk with respect to air noise with the people of Staten Island, that practically every plane that takes off to the south goes over Staten Island. So I can appreciate those who don't want more planes going over because the people in Staten Island suffer every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The preferred alternative in the plan will reduce traffic from Newark Airport from about 20 minutes to 12 minutes; will reduce air noise, as I said, over Staten Island; will reduce costs to airlines by $248 million by 2011; and a 1999 study showed that by 2010, we would hurt the U.S. economy by about another $4 billion, and the preferred alternative outlined in the plan could save our economy as much as 7 to 9 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important and imperative that this plan go through. The riding public deserves it. Those sitting on runways now deserve it. Those waiting to get to Newark or any other airport deserve it. And I would just urge a speedy and urgent opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400142" topic="">
    <paragraph>Before yielding to my colleague from Connecticut, this appropriations bill relating to the FAA has always carried language directing the FAA to deal with the issue of air noise. It has been repeatedly ignored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Shays of Connecticut.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Frelinghuysen-Shays-Garrett amendment should be adopted. The big guns, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee involved in transportation and, the ranking member and the chairman of the full Transportation Committee, and the ranking member are all against it. And what they're doing is sending a message once again to the FAA that they can continue to be arrogant, that they can continue to ignore the public, that they can continue to do whatever they want as it relates clearly to safety  and efficiency, but they don't have to care about anything else. They don't have to care about quality of life. They don't have to listen to anybody about quality of life, particularly as it relates to impact of noise. They can ignore us as they have continued to ignore us throughout the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So now what you will have in LaGuardia is planes taking off twice as often. They will veer to the left, then they will veer to the right. They will veer to the left, they will veer to the right. They won't run these planes over Long Island Sound. They will run them right over individual homes. They don't care. They don't listen. They don't give us an opportunity to speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have constituents who have attended hearings, but are told, Listen to us. You can't testify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we want the FAA to come and allow testimony, they say we'll come to Danbury (where the planes are at 8,000 feet), but we won't come in to Stamford where they're 4,000 feet. They don't want anyone to know what they're doing. We need to pay attention to them. We need to give some authority to those in the community who have a different view ..... to those who are concerned about noise and quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the [Frelinghuysen/Shays/Garrett] amendment that would prohibit funding for the Federal Aviation Administration to implement its New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia Airspace Redesign for one year until FAA Reauthorization is complete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let me say I understand the FAA's desire to improve efficiency at LaGuardia, Newark, Teterboro, Philadelphia and JFK. I represent a great number of business travelers who are frustrated by long delays at many of these airports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that being said, however, I strongly oppose the FAA's Integrated Airspace Alternative that would route more air traffic over residential neighborshoods. Over the past few months, the FAA has zeroed in on this proposal as its preferred alternative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout this time, I have shared my concerns and the concerns of my constituents with the FAA, particularly the fact that the plan brings more planes into the region at the expense of the region's quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly disappointed the FAA has not implemented any noise mitigation strategies in the district I represent, or in many districts throughout the Northeast, despite the wide swath of land over the Fourth District that will be adversely impacted by planes flying as low as 4,000 feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though there is no mandate to consider quality of life issues, the FAA simply must not ignore the hugely negative impacts of air noise in this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that if the FAA had to consider the quality of life impacts of the Integrated Airspace Alternative, it would never have concluded that airspace redesign was the appropriate first attempt at relieving air traffic congestion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me there are other solutions that should be considered before implementing such a radical alternative that negatively affects so many thousands of residents throughout the Northeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my judgment, a one year delay to this plan is appropriate. We are working to reauthorize the FAA this year. I am hopeful we can give the FAA authority to implement other solutions in the authorization process, and protect precious quality-of-life. I urge adoption of this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In May, the Appropriations Committee included language in the FY07 supplemental to impose requirements on the Department of Transportation before they open the U.S. border to Mexican trucks, giving them free range across the United States of America. This language by the committee was the first step in ensuring that the Department of Transportation considered safety and security ramifications before allowing cross-border traffic and before rushing into a pilot. And unfortunately,  the Bush administration immediately declared that they were in compliance with the law, making no changes in their program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is a paper-based program. They have not inspected physically one Mexican truck. They have not interviewed one Mexican driver. In Mexico, they have no system of drug testing, unlike the United States of America, and no certified drug-testing laboratories, unlike the United States of America. They have no hours of service in Mexico. Mexican drivers are frequently required to drive as long as 72 hours. They take drugs to do it. They freely admit that in the Mexican press.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to support Congressman DeFazio's amendment and appreciate the chairman's willingness to consider it. Coming from the Midwestern part of the country, we literally have had Mexican trucks end up in our region, how, we don't know, where the driver was actually moving the steering wheel with a vise grip. Now, how does that get to the State of Ohio all the way from the border with Mexico? Something is really broken in the system already. We should not  expand anything. We should fix the problem that we have today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, has worked tirelessly on the issue of cross-border trucking in this Congress and I commend his determination in probing the details of the Administration's plans to open the U.S.-Mexico border to truck traffic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I strongly support this amendment, I am at the same time extremely disappointed that Congress must take yet another step to compel the Administration to do the right thing and protect the safety of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of Congress face growing frustration with the Administration's clear desire to  open the U.S.-Mexico border at any cost, with minimal regard for the safety of the traveling public, and little attention to the concerns raised by the House and Senate. Today's amendment is the culmination of a mounting effort to ensure safety and to hold the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") accountable as the Department reveals its plans for opening our  nation's southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 23, 2007, Secretary of Transportation Peters announced the start of a one-year pilot program to grant 100 Mexico-domiciled trucking companies unrestricted access to U.S. roads, beyond the commercial zones at the U.S.-Mexico border. DOT has acknowledged that this pilot program is the first step to full border opening. This announcement had generated a groundswell of opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since February, Congress has tried to shed some light on this pilot program. On March 13, 2007, the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit held an oversight hearing on the pilot program. Chairman DeFazio and I have asked the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation to review the proposed pilot program for compliance with all applicable motor carrier safety and hazardous materials laws and regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 29, 2007, Representative BOYDA introduced <bill type="h" number="1773">H.R. 1773</bill>, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, of which I am a proud sponsor. This legislation limits the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to unilaterally open the United States-Mexico border to truck and bus traffic under the ruse of a hasty pilot program. Instead the bill provides the U.S. with an opportunity to test, evaluate, and learn from the impacts of allowing Mexico-domiciled trucks on our highways, but only once  a strict set of prerequisites are met and only under a specific set of conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the beginning of May, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ordered the bill reported to the House by a vote of 66-0. The House passed the bill on May 15, 2007, by an overwhelming vote of 411-3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The message to Secretary Peters has been clear: proceed with caution and do not open the border to Mexico-domiciled trucks until sufficient checks are in place to ensure that they meet U.S. motor carrier safety laws. Yet, DOT opposes the safeguards included in H.R 1773. It continues to charge ahead, and intends to start the pilot program as early as next month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agency seems to have little regard for what findings or shortcomings may come to light in the reviews required to date by Congress. DOT has been unwilling to make changes to its plans to bring the proposed pilot program in line with the strict criteria strongly supported by the House. As a result, we must take this action today to bring this program to a standstill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to question whether DOT is truly ready to open the border, and whether adequate systems are in place to make sure Mexican carriers meet our strict federal safety requirements. It is well-established that Mexican law does not require many fundamental elements of highway safety that are required for U.S. vehicles and drivers, including hours-of-service restrictions, drug and alcohol testing, and commercial driver's licensing requirements. Data collection issues and tracking violations  of Mexican drivers while operating in the U.S. also remains a challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States is bound to live up to its commitments under the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"). However, nothing in NAFTA suggests that we must allow Mexico-domiciled motor carriers to operate throughout the U.S. if they pose a safety hazard to our citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Launching a cross-border pilot program represents a major shift in transportation policy. It is the responsibility of DOT to ensure that any program that allows trucks from Mexico to enter the United States must be conducted with the safety of the American people as the highest priority. We must not forget this in a rush to open the border.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to prevent HUD from implementing a new rule that will effectively close homeownership opportunity to many American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In today's housing market, one of the primary barriers to achieving the dream of homeownership is the lack of accumulated wealth and disposable income. Fortunately, some nonprofit organizations have developed programs to provide down payments to qualifying families. Such programs empower individuals and families who lack the necessary funds for down payment and other related costs, but can afford the monthly mortgage payment to become homeowners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These down payment assistance programs have proven successful in expanding ownership opportunity to low- and moderate-income families. In the past, HUD has permitted the use of these programs in conjunction with FHA-insured loans. Recently, however, HUD issued a proposed rule that would effectively eliminate seller-funded down payment assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very concerned about the impact of this proposed rule on homeownership in this country. Rather than going too far, I believe we should develop reasonable and fair criteria by which these programs can continue to operate while also protecting the FHA insurance fund. If there are legitimate problems that have been identified by HUD, then let's work together to fix the problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I offer today with Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee Chairman Waters and Mr. Al Green of Texas would prohibit funds from being used to implement this proposed rule. It would give Congress time to work with HUD to preserve down payment assistance programs while imposing strong regulations and oversight. This amendment will would allow us to put the control in place that will weed out the bad actors, while still allowing those who help millions become  homeowners to continue their good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to preserve homeownership opportunities for all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment which would overturn HUD's urgent attempt to halt these scam practices by the so-called nonprofits that operate under the veil of helping people get mortgages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the guidance of the Inspector General, and in coordination with the Treasury Department, HUD is moving to crack down on so-called nonprofits that offer to pay the down payment so that families can purchase a home. This amendment would overturn that effort and cost the taxpayers some millions of dollars in defaulted loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there may be honest nonprofits, and I am sure there are, that genuinely want to help increase homeownership, this program does have many problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the default rate for mortgages in which the down payment is paid for by nonprofits is three times the national average. That is the default rate. This has cost millions and is a source of instability to the fund, and, according to HUD, is a major reason that the FHA fund is rapidly heading to a deficit situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, there is no free lunch. The mortgages are simply turned upside down with the down payment added to the price of the home. They are not free to the homeowner. Further, expensive fees are often added to the costs of the mortgage by nonprofits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Treasury Department is moving quickly to revoke the nonprofit status  of many of these organizations, but HUD needs to act now and needs to get this rule out as final.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose any attempt to delay the rule and oppose this amendment. I think that if the Federal Government is so concerned about how a program is operating that it feels compelled to draft a regulation, I think we should carefully review the situation before we rush to overturn that effort. Frankly, we have not done that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Miller-Waters-Green amendment to <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill>. On June 22, 2007, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, which I chair, held a hearing on homeowner down payment assistance programs. That hearing provided a window into down payment assistance programs that I had not seen before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hearing was prompted by the issuance of the HUD proposed rule on May 11, 2007, to terminate down payment assistance programs. I applaud HUD for extending the comment period for the proposed rule, but that is not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Down payment assistance provided by charitable organizations to low- and moderate-income individuals and families to purchase homes has been a mainstay of HUD and FHA since 1999. In fact, we heard testimony that 30 to 40 percent of FHA loans used some type of down payment assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was even more astonishing was that HUD proposed a similar rule in 1999, only to have never finalized it. Indeed, HUD's failure to finalize a rule gave de facto approval for the continuation of many down payment assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Down payment assistance is often used in conjunction with HUD's mortgage insurance under the 203(b) program administered by FHA. Down payment assistance programs have helped nearly 1 million low- and moderate-income persons become homeowners, providing an instant source of equity for them. Homeownership would be out of reach to thousands of homeowners without down payment assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, HUD's issuance of the proposed rule on May 11, 2007, would eliminate the use of down payment assistance programs. FHA opposes the use of direct or indirect funding provided from the sale of property, and that is fine. But an across-the-board rejection of all down payment assistance programs without further review, analysis or clarification from HUD is unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Down payment assistance programs do not need to be the scapegoat for, as what one HUD called it, the "looming shortfall" in HUD's fiscal year 2008 budget. I believe if HUD is left to its own devices, this is exactly what will happen to down payment assistance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support down payment assistance programs meeting Federal requirements. Therefore, I ask that you join Gary Miller, Al Green and me in supporting the amendment to prohibit HUD from implementing the proposed rule with any funds from this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment because it is a good amendment, and HUD's language is bad language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, since 1997, this program has assisted literally nearly 1 million families with down payment assistance. In my district alone, it has helped more than 600 families. This program is a privately funded down payment assistance program. I think that is important for us to highlight, a privately funded down payment assistance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, there is some concern with reference to the appraisals, but that can be amended and fixed by way of a program similar to what the VA has. The VA has a blind pool appraisal process. With a blind pool appraisal process, you can get the appraisals that are fair market value, and you will save the program that has helped so many families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This program is viable. It helps community development. It is meaningful. It helps needy buyers. It is workable. It can work through HUD, and it is achievable without this language. I suggest that my colleagues vote for it. Let's save this program. Let's vote for this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I respect my good friend's argument on behalf of Treasury and HUD; however, I want to remind my colleagues that it has been just a few years ago that Treasury and HUD came to us and asked us to implement the American Dream Down Payment Assistance Act, which means the Federal Government will give individuals the down payment and closing cost money necessary to be able to own a home that otherwise they would never be able to own a home where they can make the payment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument made to us is the private sector is doing it. We can implement upon what the private sector is doing, and with the government's participation, we can put even more people into homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now, if we have a problem as some say with appraisals that are not being factual enough, then let's implement the same underwriting criteria that FHA will use on zero downpayment and FHA uses on the American Dream Downpayment Act. If you can come up with a reasonable appraisal to give Federal dollars to somebody to buy a home, why can you not come up with the same criteria for a reasonable appraisal to help the private sector put people into homes?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Green made a very good point. We put a million people into homes with the Downpayment Assistance Program provided by the private sector, and the argument made in committee was 15 percent of these loans that were made are troubled. Now, that does not mean that 15 percent are being foreclosed upon. That means 15 percent might have missed a payment at one point in time or had some other problem at some other point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But on the other side, you have 850,000 people, families who own a home today, who built up equity they would not have otherwise have had renting a home and now have a home that had it not been for the private sector would have been renting an apartment or be in section 8 or in government housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If that 15 percent relates to 4 or 5 percent in foreclosures, and if that 4 or 5 percent has something to do with underwriting standards being used that do not meet the criteria they should meet, or if appraisals are being implemented that do not meet the criteria they should meet, let's get together as a Congress first in committee, let's deal with the problems and rewrite the law and bring it before this House and debate it, and let's make sure that the bad apples and those that my friend said  are practicing scam practices are eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to think that we are going to eliminate the possibility in the next 4 or 5 years for a million families to own a home, or have them come to the Federal Government and ask for a downpayment when they could also go to the private sector and ask for a downpayment, it seems some way disingenuous and unrealistic for us to do that. If there is a problem, let's fix it. If FHA can offer a zero downpayment loan under given underwriting criteria, and we use the same underwriting criteria for a downpayment  assistance loan and the person owes $200,000 with zero downpayment and $194,000 with the downpayment assistance, they are better off with the program.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there are a number of earmarks in this bill that are somewhat similar to this one. I will be the first to admit I don't know all that much about the Edmonds Center for the Arts. But as I follow these typical earmark debates, I know that soon there will be a Member to come to the floor to tell me he knows his district better than I do. Mr. Chairman, I concede the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will also tell me that this body has the authority to provide for this earmark. Mr. Chairman, I once again concede the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure they will come down here and say good things can be done with the money. Mr. Chairman, once again, I will concede the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They will also tell us well, it is a very small portion of the Federal budget. Mr. Chairman, I will concede the point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is what I will not concede: the money is a very small portion of the Federal budget. But I fear again that earmarks in general, and perhaps this category in specific, become a larger portion of the culture of spending which is harmful to the Nation. We need to look at it very closely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often amendments are brought to the floor that many Members will say this is just draconian. We can't manage to spend less money here. Okay, so we offer earmark amendments and people say, well, it is just a small portion of the Federal budget. It is kind of like either the porridge is too hot or the porridge is too cold. When is the right time to offer an amendment to try to save taxpayers money?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is money that under the certification letter the funding would be used for renovation of the Edmonds Center for the Arts. Again, there are a number of earmarks that do this. I assume, frankly, there are Members of both parties that are requesting this funding. But it needs to be put in context because every time we so-called "invest" in a project like this, there is somebody out in America that is being divested in order to pay for the investment. So we have to look very closely at  where this money is coming from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Member after Member comes to the floor to tell us we should do everything we can to preserve the Social Security trust fund. We know under our unified budget today that as long as we are running a deficit, and unfortunately we still are, it is declining due to lots of tax revenue, but we still have a deficit. We know that this expenditure is going to come ultimately out of the Social Security trust fund. Yet so many Members come to the floor to decry the practice. So is this money going  to the Edmonds Center for the Arts worth raiding the Social Security trust fund? I believe not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we know that the Democrats, Mr. Chairman, in their budget resolution, it contains the single largest tax increase in American history. Over 5 years if we don't figure out a way to stop it, the average American family will have an average $3,000 a year tax burden. That is money coming out of their pocket that they could have used for their arts, their entertainment, and their transportation; but they are being divested in order to invest in centers for the arts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, I have no doubt that the sponsor of the earmark knows his district better than I do, just like I know my district better than he does. In talking to people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, they think their tax money might be used for better purposes. And if it is going to go to art centers, they kind of prefer that Mesquite Art Center be funded. They prefer the Henderson County Performing Arts Center be funded. They prefer the Lake Country Playhouse in Mineola  to be funded; and they prefer the Kaufman County Civic Theater in Terrell, Texas, be funded, and the list goes on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that we are threatened with the single largest tax increase in history, a vote for this is to raid the Social Security trust fund. And already with the spending we have, we are due to double taxes on the next generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Congress has the right to do this. I don't question our authority; I question our wisdom in doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>This is a misguided amendment. It is quite a surprise that of all of the decent efforts to help communities across the country, for some reason the gentleman picked this one. That is something beyond at least my understanding. The particular project involved here is a community center that is involved in a whole host of youth projects, including the Edmonds Boys and Girls Club, the Sno-King County Youth Club, the Triple Threat Basketball Club, the Brighton School, the Cascade Symphony  Orchestra, the Edmonds High School Multi-Class Reunion, the Olympic Ballet Theater, the Sno-King Community Chorale, and Edmonds Community College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know why those seem like such un-American activities to the gentleman, but to our community and to the country at large, those are integral parts of our communities. I may note this is not a situation where somehow there has been some sort of Federal largesse, that is an intrusion into the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an effort where we have multiple parties that have been associated with funding this project. This is not just the Federal Government. In fact, it is less than 10 percent of the entire project. It is financed with Federal funds. It is largely a matter of local development, including a variety of local corporations. So where we have less than 10 percent in this final phase, why this has been selected doesn't make sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now there is a difference, I suppose. I hold a press release from the author of the amendment dated February 28, 2007, announcing that the city of Winnsboro, Texas, had received $100,000 in Federal funds. The author of the amendment said: "I am excited that some of the hard-earned tax dollars sent to Washington are flowing back into the county." There is a difference, I suppose, between that money flowing to Edmonds, Washington. In that case it was money going to the proponent of this amendment.  In this case it goes to a different one. I am not sure I understand the difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess the difference is the money that went to Texas was chosen by the bureaucrats. The money that is selected here has been chosen by the United States House of Representatives. Now, I don't know why the proponent believes there is some intrinsic genius of the bureaucrats. Some believe all bureaucrats are smarter than all Congressmen, or the least wise bureaucrat is smarter than the most intelligent Congressman. Some may hold that view; I don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a valid community purpose here. We have a small Federal commitment, and we have a useful thing that is helping kids at risk as well as community development. I note that an economic evaluation of this particular project showed that it would have significant economic value as well as community value in helping the kids in these local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would commend this small investment of Federal dollars in this community.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield time to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Shuler).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today on behalf of myself and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1941, the United States was building up for World War II in dire need of new sources of energy. The Tennessee Valley Authority obtained Federal authority for construction of a hydroelectric dam in Swain County, North Carolina. This construction required that an important road be flooded. In a 1943 agreement, the Federal Government promised to rebuild the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 64 years since the agreement was signed, no road has been completed and no settlement was offered to the people of Swain County. The 2001 Transportation bill provided $16 million to study the environmental costs of building this new road. The National Park Service will complete this study in September.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the financial and economical costs are too high to build this road. The National Park Service has said that the final environmental impact study will recommend a cash settlement with the people of Swain County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators ALEXANDER and DOLE have amended the Senate version of this bill with language to allow the Park Service to use remaining funds from this study for this solution. This commonsense solution enjoys strong bipartisan support in the North Carolina and Tennessee House delegations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, would you be willing to work with me and Congressman Wamp to ensure that this bipartisan language is included in the final conference version of this bill?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the gentleman for bringing this issue to our attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixty-four years is a long and, it seems, quite unreasonable time to wait for the government to resolve this issue. So I pledge to work with you both on this issue as we move forward in this process and conference this bill with the Senate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, and I would like to thank my colleague ZACK WAMP for his hard work along with this bill, and I certainly thank the chairman for your hard work and your dedication.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield now to Mr. Crowley from New York also for a colloquy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation and want to commend you and the ranking member and your staffs for the hard work that has been put into this bill. I would also like to engage you, as you mentioned, in a colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased the committee included $15.8 million to hire and train new air traffic controllers. This will go a long way in helping to ensure the safety of our skies. However, I believe that more needs to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that we have 1,100 fewer fully certified air traffic controllers than we did on 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my concerns were underscored by a recent incident at La Guardia Airport, which is in my district in the Seventh Congressional District in Queens. As you know, La Guardia Airport is one of the busiest airports in the Nation. Over 1,000 flights a day and 27 million passengers a year frequent the airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 5 of this year, two planes nearly crashed on the runway. While a catastrophe was narrowly avoided this time, many questions remain as to the cause of the incident, including whether it was due to a staffing shortage, a lack of well-qualified air traffic controllers, or simply pure human error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we must examine the incident at La Guardia while we also examine the larger issue, which is determining how we must address the impending air traffic controller shortage. That is why I believe that Congress must fund a study by the National Academy of Sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This study would examine what factors are contributing to air traffic safety concerns, including human factors, increased traffic activity, and the technology and equipment at our Nation's airports. Ultimately the report will recommend how to address this issue, particularly with regard to staffing standards and whether we need to train more air traffic controllers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I intended to offer an amendment today to fund this study, but it would have been subject to a point of order. So instead, Mr. Chairman, I am hoping we can agree to work together as this legislation moves forward to find a way to address this issue and potentially fund this study.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is a vital public safety concern that we must address. I understand that the FAA has been working with the National Academy of Sciences and has factored in many of its recommendations from the Academy. The FAA is also working with Mitre algorithms, models and base assumptions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, want to ensure that the skies remain safe, and I will work with the gentleman to ensure an adequate number of controllers exist in that area.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if I could just respond, I want to thank the chairman, and as you know, if we don't address this issue, the next incident at La Guardia may not be a near miss, but rather a tragedy, one that I hope we would avoid. And I would imagine if it were a tragedy, we would be having a different conversation than this colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman for his time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 21 offered by Mr. Hensarling:</chair>
  <chair> At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the following:</chair>
  <chair> Sec. 410. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used for parking facilities. &lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to the order of the House of today, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment is aimed at limiting funding for parking facilities within this bill, which is not including Federal facilities that might be included within bills dealing with our military bases, GAO, national parks, what have you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, apparently there are about 15 or so of these earmarks covering Members of both parties, and again, as I said earlier, Mr. Chairman, I know that the funds represented are probably a small portion of Federal spending, but I think it is good, I think it is wise that this House pause from time to time and look at the fiscal challenge that we are facing and to remember, if everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I have no doubt that parking facilities are needed all over America, but I doubt the wisdom within the confines of this bill of using Federal taxpayer money today to pay for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's take a look at the challenge that we're facing, Mr. Chairman, and just don't take my word for the fact that we have a great fiscal challenge. Let's listen to our Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke. He said recently, without "early and meaningful action" to address spending in Washington, "the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened; with future generations bearing much of the cost."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's listen to the Brookings Institute, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought: "The authors of this book believe that the Nation's fiscal situation is out of control and could do serious damage to the economy in coming decades."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's listen to the General Accountability Office: The rising costs of government spending, specifically entitlements, are "a fiscal cancer" that threatens "catastrophic consequences for our country" and could "bankrupt America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's listen again to the GAO: "Absent policy changes on the spending and/or revenue sides of the budget, a growing imbalance between expected Federal spending and tax revenues will mean escalating and ultimately unsustainable Federal deficits and debt  that serve to threaten our future national security as well as the standard of living for the American people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal budget continues to grow way beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it, and seemingly, the only standard for spending the people's money today is do we have a noble purpose, and can some good use be made of the money. But, Mr. Chairman, that standard is not sufficient. It's not sufficient when we're threatening future generations with a fiscal calamity. Sooner or later, this body needs to say enough is enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost every State in the Union, I think, save but two or three, are running a surplus. We're running a deficit, and what are we doing? We're funding local parking facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Chairman, I'm not here to debate the constitutionality of doing that, but, again, I'm here to debate the wisdom, given the fiscal challenges the Nation faces, and all too often I fear that this body is more focused on the next election and not the next generation. But the Comptroller General has said we're on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, fiscal responsibility has to be included in each and every bill, and we have a bill that's growing about 6.7 percent. Let's somewhere draw a line in the sand on behalf of American families, on behalf of American taxpayers, on behalf of future generations and just say, you know, today the Federal taxpayer and future generations are not going to have to pay for parking facilities. It's all this amendment is about, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the author of this amendment is undoubtedly trying to get at some egregious earmarks that are funded in this bill or in some other bill; however, in drafting a provision that is so broad in scope that what we have is an amendment that's careless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are legitimate parking facilities that can be built using Federal funds, and I use an example, for instance, the parking facilities that we have with elder housing projects, built in various places around the country, but this amendment would kill that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law Federal funds can be used to fund park-and-ride facilities and other activities aimed at encouraging carpooling and vanpooling. In fact, these activities are of such a high priority that they're eligible for 100 percent Federal funding and require no State or local match. Similarly, Federal funds are used to build safety rest areas along our interstates. This amendment would put an end to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons and others, this amendment must be defeated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would just point out that this bill funds what we call the 811 program, housing for disabled. Now, I don't know why we would want to say that we would vote money to build housing for the disabled but no parking. Have we found a new group of totally mobile disabled?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mean, this amendment would say that if you got funds under the 811 program to build housing for disabled people, you couldn't provide parking for vans, for transportation. I'm really baffled as to the scope, and I do think that telling people that they could not provide parking at a disabled housing facility is a very poor idea.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this money's going to have to come from somewhere. So, again, I would invite the committee chairman to tell us, is this part of the largest tax increase in history? Is this coming out of the Social Security Trust Fund? Is this going to be debt passed on to future generations? Where is the money going to come from? Does it reach that purpose?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I cannot believe that the only parking lots that are made available to those who are disabled are somehow coming from the Federal taxpayer. I just don't believe it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the answer to the gentleman from Texas is when you have federally funded housing for the disabled, the parking that goes for the disabled and the service vehicles comes from that money. So the gentleman says, why does the Federal Government have to pay for parking? I don't know who else the gentleman thinks is going to pay for parking at housing that is built for people who are disabled.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parking facilities are eligible under a number of our surface transportation programs, funded out of the Highway Trust Fund. In the SAFETEA-LU legislation, we authorize funding for parking facilities to encourage commuters to park their vehicles and use public transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congestion is a growing problem all across this country. It costs us $68 billion a year. The more cars we can get off the roadway and more people use public transportation, the better off citizens are in their drive patterns. And the parking facilities encourage carpooling, vanpooling and use of light rail and commuter rail and local bus transit operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, because they're funded with Highway Trust Fund moneys, no fees can be charged at these parking facilities, so they're not revenue-generating activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, we have imposed very strict standards for highway safety for long-haul truckers. Hours of service have been limited so that roadways will be safer, but those long-haul truckers, working long hours, need safe places where they can rest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The hours of service limitation requires them to stay off the roadway before they become fatigued. That's why we have parking facilities to accommodate over-the-road truck drivers, as well as passenger vehicle drivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the parking facilities we provide under the SAFETEA-LU national transportation program is in the best public interest, in the interest of public safety and in the interest of roadway safety, to the best interest of the driving public, reduces congestion, and we ought not to take this broad brush stroke and strike the spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No, we carefully considered these issues in the course of fashioning the SAFETEA-LU in the House and the Senate and conference and on this House floor. Let's keep existing policy in place and defeat this misguided amendment.</paragraph>
