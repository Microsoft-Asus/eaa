    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush once again threatened to veto a bipartisan agreement that will provide health care insurance to 10 million low-income children. The President should talk to our Nation's Governors, 43 of whom have voiced support for a strengthened CHIP reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican Governor of Utah, Jon Huntsman, said, "CHIP is a much needed safety net for uninsured kids, and Congress showed tremendous foresight in authorizing it a decade ago. Uninsured children are the State's number one priority."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican Governor of Wisconsin, Tim Pawlenty, said, "We as Governors also want to make sure that the current population, and hopefully some reasonable expansions, could be covered."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Republican Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger said, "We cannot roll back the clock on the program that has helped to ensure children who need it most to have a healthy start in life."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Republican and Democratic Governors alike recognize the importance of this program. I hope the President will listen to these Governors and reconsider his veto threat.</paragraph>
