  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the award of a Congressional Gold Medal to our former colleague, Senator Ed Brooke, is eminently well-deserved, and I urge the Senate to approve this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To all of us who know Ed Brooke, he was an outstanding Senator, a true statesman, a champion of equal justice and opportunity for all, and a man of great conscience and compassion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Brooke was born in Washington, DC, not far from these Chambers on Capitol Hill, and he graduated from Howard University. He had studied medicine, intending to become a physician, but realized that he was more at home in the fields of literature, political science, and history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After finishing his degree at Howard, he served our country in World War II as a captain in the Army's segregated 366th Infantry Regiment, which fought with great courage in the Italian theater. During his service, he distinguished himself not only as a gifted leader, but as a skilled defense counsel in court martial proceedings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Returning from the war, he enrolled in Boston University Law School and became editor of the Law Review. After graduating, he began a successful law practice in Massachusetts and continued his commitment to public service as well. He chaired the Finance Commission of Boston, and specialized in rooting out public corruption. His ability, energy, and dedication won him renown, and he was elected attorney general of Massachusetts, becoming the first African American in the Nation to hold such a  position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his two terms as attorney general, he became a leader in the battle against organized crime</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, he was elected to the Senate from Massachusetts, the first African-American Senator since Reconstruction. I vividly remember escorting him down the center aisle of this Chamber for his swearing in. At that time, the Senate was deeply involved in enacting the historic civil rights legislation of the 1960s, and I was touched by the magnitude and immense symbolism of that moment for Ed and his family, for African Americans, for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and for the Nation as a  whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When people question Ed about his significant place in history, his response is always spirited and unchanging. He didn't want to be remembered only as the Senate's African-American Member. During his campaign for attorney general, he had said, "I'm not running as a Negro. I never have. I'm trying to show that people can be elected on the basis of their qualifications and not their race."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed always saw himself in this light. Despite his other "firsts," he was first and foremost an American and a son of Massachusetts, and it was important to him that his accomplishments and talents speak louder than the color of his skin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Needless to say, his heritage uniquely qualified him to combat social injustice and stand as an eloquent voice for America's oppressed. He served on President Johnson's Commission on Civil Disorders, which investigated the causes of the race riots in American cities at the time, and the committee's recommendations became a central part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he spoke on the Senate floor in support of the extending the Voting Rights Act in 1975, he addressed this body with inspiring candor and sincerity. In a time of great turmoil and division, he was a symbol of hope for Americans of color throughout our Nation--hope that our country was changing, hope that the American dream was still alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who were intent on defeating the Voting Rights Act could not avoid pangs of conscience as Ed declared, "I cannot believe that in 1975, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, we are ready to say to the American people, black and white, red and brown, that they cannot be assured of the basic right to vote!" His point was irresistible, and the very next day, the Senate passed the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ed was passionate about opportunity for all. In his two terms with us, he set a high standard for public service and was a model of senatorial independence, supporting measures on both sides of the aisle that he felt strengthened our country, and improved the lives of all Americans. He was a champion of the minimum wage, a strong voice for Medicare and Social Security, and an effective defender of women's rights. The title of his autobiography, "Bridging the Divide," published earlier this  year, says it all. He bridged race, he bridged parties, and defied any conventional categorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember Ed discussing the difficulty of providing a home for his family after his return from World War II, at a time when race disqualified him from considering certain properties. His plight was characteristic of the struggle experienced by millions of Americans at that time. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 is a tribute to his leadership as a Senator, and long after he left the Senate, he continued the battle for fair housing and opportunity as leader of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, "We must come to see that the end we seek is a society of peace. That will be the day not of the white man, not the black man. That will be the day of man as man." Edward Brooke is the embodiment of Dr. King's vision. He was a great Senator among us, he is still a caring public servant. He is a great American, and he certainly deserves this very special tribute from Congress. I urge my colleagues to approve this award of the Congressional Gold Medal to  our former colleague, Ed Brooke.</paragraph>
