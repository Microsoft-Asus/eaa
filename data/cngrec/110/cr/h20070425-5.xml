  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, nine more soldiers are dead, and our soldiers can claim victory in Iraq. Madam Speaker, even after losing thousands of American lives and spending billions of taxpayer dollars, the Bush administration continues to demand an open-ended commitment of American troops in Iraq with no exit plan and no strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this Democratic Congress, the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, understands the responsibility of war. We understand the commitment to the American people, and, yes, we understand the needs of national security. Retired military officers support our plan and the new direction for Iraq to begin to redeploy our troops to begin to bring them home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Gates has gone to Iraq trying to stop the bleeding, but he believes that congressional debate is helpful, and he has said that the clock is ticking. Can the Bush administration understand that? The Pentagon has confirmed, through a Congressional Research Service report, that the President's comments about us stopping funding, the Congress stopping funding, is absolutely wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to save lives. We need to restore the confidence and the leadership in Iraq, but we need to claim victory for our soldiers. They have done their job. It's time to bring them home now.</paragraph>
