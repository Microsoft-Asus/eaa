    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the hardworking men and women of America have reason to rejoice. Today from the people's House, the House of Representatives, we have heard the call of the people of America, and we will today say that labor has dignity and the working people of America deserve a raise in pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a long time coming, about 10 years; too long in fact, too long. Fifteen million people will benefit. But the people who get the pay increase, they will not be the only beneficiaries. You and I will be able to claim a generous Nation that believes that all labor is dignified and must be honored with fair and decent pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poverty has increased every year over the last 6 years. The ranks of the uninsured have increased every year over the last 6 years; and something else has increased over the last 6 years, executive pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An average CEO makes more before lunch than the average minimum wage worker makes all year long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the House recognizes that all labor is important; all workers deserve dignity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the House recognizes that 37 million people living in poverty is not acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this should mark a new beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Toward concerning all--because a loving nation looks out for the health and wellness of all its people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's a step towards a livable wage--not just a minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Toward economic justice.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
