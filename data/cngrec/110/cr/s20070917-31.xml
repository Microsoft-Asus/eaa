  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I honor two of my constituents on a very special and rare milestone. Later this month, Mary and Bill Kirchner of Atlanta will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary and Bill were married on September 28, 1957, in Grosse Pointe, MI, bringing together two of that city's longtime families--the Fitzsimons and the Kirchners. The next 50 years took Mary and Bill from Michigan to South Carolina and finally to Georgia, where they have lived since 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill was a homebuilder in Michigan and on Hilton Head Island, SC, and later started his own property rental business on the island. Mary started her own successful business on Hilton Head called The Welcome Mat, then switched careers and put her salesmanship to good use selling real estate. When they moved to Atlanta, Mary and Bill decided to try an entirely new business venture by opening an antique consignment shop. Sixteen years later, Now &amp; Again remains a beautiful and popular shop in Buckhead.  In fact, my wife Dianne has been a customer. Although they have certainly earned the right to retire, Mary and Bill still run their shop 6 days a week with the help of a great staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While their professional lives have been an adventure, Mary and Bill made their biggest life-changing decision early on in their marriage. On a chilly February day in 1964, a nervous Mary and Bill arrived at an adoption agency in Michigan hoping to hear that they would be allowed to adopt a baby. Instead, the agency asked if Mary and Bill would like to go home with 6-month-old twin girls. The shocked couple said yes and forever changed the lives of those twins, Sarah and Joan, for the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their daughter Sarah is now married to Stephen Midas and works as a stay-at-home mom to four children in Chesapeake, VA, and also does some bookkeeping for Mary and Bill's shop. Their daughter Joan and her daughter live in Washington, DC, and Joan has gone from covering politics as an AP reporter in Atlanta to now working for some of those same elected officials she used to cover. I happen to be one of those, and Joan now serves on my staff in Washington. I know Mary and Bill are very proud of  both their daughters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with Joan, Sarah, Stephen and their children--Alex, Ben, Anna, Josie and Isabel--in congratulating Mary and Bill Kirchner on reaching their golden anniversary. Their marriage and their commitment to each other is an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
