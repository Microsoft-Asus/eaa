    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would now like to return to the pending business, the farm bill, which we have now been working on in the Senate for a period of time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The pending business is the farm bill.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will make a few general comments about the farm bill. It is a piece of legislation which is very important to the food and fuel security of this country. I have had the honor of working with Senator Harkin and his leadership of this effort, along with Senator Chambliss now, for at least 2 1/2  years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is truly historic for our country. Senator Thune, who is on the floor with me this afternoon, has also been one of those champions in trying to be sure we get a good farm bill for the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the heart of this farm bill, we are talking about opening a whole new chapter for America. It is not just a new chapter for rural America, this is opening a new chapter for the clean energy future for the United States of America. And title IX of this legislation, which has been supplemented with the resources that are coming from the Finance Committee and the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, will make this farm bill the best farm bill for the clean energy  future of America we have ever had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it will open a whole new chapter of opportunity for America as we try to deal with those forces that have kept us addicted to the foreign powers that control the oil of this world. It goes beyond energy, in terms of the new chapter we open here. It also deals with conservation, where the additional $4 billion or so that is in this legislation will help us embrace a new ethic forward in conservation; will make sure that that 70 percent of America which now houses the farms and ranches of America  remains the kind of land and water we can be very proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a very good bill in terms of conservation. It also is a very good bill in making sure the nutrition programs of this country are fully funded. We often remind the people of this country that even though it is called a farm bill, and people think about it as a bill that affects only rural America, it affects all  of America, and you see that particularly in the nutrition title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Conrad has come to the floor and often reminded our colleagues, about 67 percent of all the investment we are making in this farm bill is going into the nutrition title of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a significant investment to help those who are most vulnerable. There are significant additions we are making in this farm bill that will make our nutrition programs even better, that include the fruit and vegetable programs, which are very much a part of this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to remind the people of America that when we talk about the farm bill, we are talking about providing the best food that can be provided. This chart shows countries such as Indonesia, where 55 percent of disposable income goes for food. In the Philippines, it is 38 percent. In China, it is 26 percent. In America, it is only 10 percent; 10 percent of the money we spend from our personal disposable income goes for food. That means American farmers and ranchers are providing the  best food at the lowest possible cost. At the end of the day, that is what is at the heart of this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss for having brought us to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 3616.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment: Senators KERRY, SCHUMER, and STABENOW. This amendment will strengthen the provisions in the farm bill that came out of the Finance Committee. It is an amendment that deals with cellulosic biofuels. We all know that cellulosic biofuels come from a different feedstock than the conventional ethanol going into our engines today, and it offers great promise for a clean energy future. Conventional ethanol  typically comes from corn or soy, but cellulosic biofuels can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks, including agricultural plant wastes, such as corn stover and cereal straws, plant waste from industrial processes, such as sawdust, and energy crops which are grown specifically for fuel production, such as switchgrasses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cellulosic biofuels have an energy content three times higher than corn ethanol, and they emit a low net level of greenhouse gases. Thanks to the great work of scientists around our country, including the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO, we are on the verge of putting cellulosic ethanol into widespread use. The agricultural tax package reported out of the Finance Committee with the leadership of Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley helps us get cellulosic  ethanol into production by creating a tax credit equivalent to $1.28 a gallon, a number that is based on findings from the Department of Energy and structured on the enhanced credit we established in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The only trouble with a tax credit is that it applies to cellulosic alcohols rather than to all cellulosic biofuels. This may appear to be a semantic difference but it actually has a huge impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As currently proposed, specifying that the credit must go only to cellulosic alcohols unnecessarily limits the applicability of this vital incentive. In my view, Congress should not be picking winners from among the cellulosic biofuels and technologies that are out there. The fact is there is an entire new range of fuels technologies being developed in the United States to go beyond ethanol. These technologies would be able to make renewable blends for diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, boiler fuels,  locomotives, and marine use. Unfortunately, many of these fuels would not be eligible for the tax incentive under the current language which specifies that a fuel must be a cellulosic alcohol. Therefore, our amendment makes a simple change. It changes cellulosic</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we begin in earnest to debate the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007, commonly referred to as the 2007 farm bill. The naming of this bill is not without meaning. It is abundantly clear that agriculture and energy production are now inherently related and together will move our Nation toward greater food and energy security. Nearly all the controversy surrounding this farm bill is focused on whether farmers and ranchers should be receiving the assistance this  bill would provide, with very little discussion of the potential this bill carries to propel American agriculture into producing alternative fuels to lessen our Nation's dependence on foreign energy sources. The 2002 farm bill was the first farm bill to include an energy title. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee during the 2002</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The energy title included in the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 also includes an energy title that builds on the success of the 2002 farm bill. The incentives in this energy title will greatly benefit American consumers, our agricultural producers, and our Nation's energy independence. The farm bill before us was crafted in the spirit of bipartisanship in the Senate Agriculture Committee and was passed out of committee by unanimous consent. We all know the 2002 farm bill expired earlier  this year on September 30. I am pleased to report that after the agreement that was reached last week, both Republicans and Democrats will be able to offer amendments to this bill. More than 120 Republican amendments have been filed on this farm bill. More than</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a several-week delay, we are now on track to debating this farm bill in an open and fair manner on the floor of the Senate. America's farmers are making planning decisions for next year without knowing what type of farm programs will be available to them. Time is of the essence. We must move quickly and with purpose to finish this farm bill for not only American agriculture but also for the millions of people who receive benefits under the nutrition and other titles of this bill. This bill  will give our agricultural producers the additional security they need to move forward with production decisions and will help meet our food and energy needs for the next 5 years and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to share a couple of facts about the 2007 farm bill. The 2007 farm bill is 1,600 pages long, and it will cost more than $286 billion over 5 years. The very first farm bill passed 70 years ago was 24 pages long. The 2007 farm bill also includes the first farm bill tax title since 1933, adding an extra degree of difficulty and further reason for open debate. During the past 30 years, the farm bill has averaged about 2 weeks of floor time and required as many as 30 recorded votes. It is not  just America's farmers and ranchers who are waiting for the 2007 farm bill. Food banks, Food Stamp, and other emergency food program recipients are all anxiously awaiting this farm bill to pass. Their share of the farm bill stake accounts for more than 66 percent of total farm bill spending, and they are pushing hard to get this farm bill passed. Rural development incentives are also on hold until we pass the 2007 farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, a powerplant in rural America is delayed because funding for USDA's rural utility service is tied up in this farm bill. Our farmers and ranchers and millions of other Americans are watching and waiting anxiously for the Senate to debate this farm bill and move it on to a conference committee with the House of Representatives. I look forward to engaging my colleagues this week in a fair and open debate on this monumental legislation which will govern programs affecting rural America  for the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate my colleague from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, being here and managing this legislation on the behalf of the Democrats today, because farm bills are not political in their orientation, at least they have not been in the past. Farm bill debates don't end up being normally partisan debate. There are regional differences, differences between different commodity organizations. Everybody comes to a farm bill debate with different priorities, depending on what part of the country they  represent. But farm bills have never been partisan or resulted in the kind of partisan gridlock and fights that typically accompany other legislation in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Colorado and I have worked closely on a number of provisions in this farm bill, particularly the  energy title. Energy production has become an integral part of the success and prosperity of rural America. In fact, this farm bill starts moving us into the next generation of energy policy and renewable energy production. We have had great success with corn-based ethanol. We will have seen by the end of this year 7.5 billion gallons of production of corn-based ethanol literally, growing in the last 10 years from ground zero to where we are today, a remarkable tribute to the good work, the initiative,  and creativity of our farmers and those who are involved in ethanol production. I give them credit for where we are today. But we also have great potential as we move into the future. We have to put in place policies that will provide the necessary financial and economic incentives for those who want</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the issue of energy production, a lot of people look at a farm bill and look at the amount of money spent on production agriculture and say: Isn't that terrible that we are spending all this money on food and fiber. We do have in front of us a food, fiber, and energy security bill. I would argue with anyone, based on the statistics the Senator from Colorado put up earlier about the cost of food in the United States and what that means to our economy and the safety and quality of  the food we have in this country, that support for production agriculture makes so much sense. If you look at this bill in its totality, the overall funding and how much is spent on production agriculture, it is only about 14 percent of total funding in the underlying bill. If you look at where the funding in this bill goes, about 9 percent of it goes into conservation programs. Those are programs that are important to America. Probably the most important conservation policy that we will put in place in terms of the environmental stewardship we have a responsibility for will be found in the conservation title of this farm bill. There is a conservation reserve program,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conservation title is 9 percent of the money, and 14 percent of the  money goes into production agriculture. That leaves about 67 percent or about two-thirds of the funding in this bill going toward food assistance programs, Food Stamps, WIC Programs, those types of programs that support people who don't have access to good quality food and need that form of assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So food pantries, food banks, and all of those other organizations across this country that meet those types of needs are awaiting action by the Congress to address those needs and get them a bill that will enable them to move forward with the programs that help address the very important concerns and needs that people providing food assistance have in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill that is comprehensive. It is a bill that struck a balance as it came out of the Agriculture Committee. It was a bipartisan bill when it left the Ag Committee. I hope it can continue to be bipartisan as we debate it on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of people have different ideas about how to address farm policy in this country. A lot of people have very different notions of what ought to be in a farm bill from those the Senator from Colorado or I might have. But that is why we have the opportunity for a fair and open debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of the amendments that are going to be debated I will probably support, and there are many I will probably oppose depending upon how I view those amendments affecting the balance that has been struck in the bill and the way it would impact my particular State of South Dakota. But I think it is fair to say it is high time this debate got underway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have to say when you look at the cost of farm bills, it is important to keep in mind, as we debate this one, that much of the cost that has been associated with the 2002 farm bill in the form of the safety net--and by that I mean your loan deficiency payments, your countercyclical payments, your direct payments--if you look at the totality of the bill and the cost over time, in the last 5 years, $22 billion in tax dollars has been saved because of higher prices, which was the way that  program was designed to work. When farm prices went higher, the assistance kicked out. When prices dropped, the assistance kicked back in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we have had now is a fairly substantial period of good prices for our producers in this country. That has led to savings for the taxpayers--$22 billion in savings over the past 5 years, over the period of the last farm bill. In many respects, I attribute that to the success of the ethanol industry because the demand for corn has raised the price of corn in this country. As the price of corn has gone up in this country, as is typically the case, the rising tide lifts all boats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen wheat prices go up, we have seen soybean prices go up largely because there is only so much acreage out there that can be put in production. So we have seen sustained prices that have enabled us to save, under the 2002 farm bill, payments that otherwise would have been going out to the farmers of this country, to the tune of $22 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when people criticize the effect that the renewable fuel programs have on farm programs, and the costs, I think it is important to keep that statistic in mind. In fact, in a January 2007 statement, the USDA chief economist stated that farm program payments were expected to be reduced by some $6 billion due to the higher value of a bushel of corn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, when you multiply that across other commodities--whether it is wheat, soybeans--overall savings in the last farm bill was $22 billion, attributable in my mind, in many respects at least, to the energy policies that were put in place in the 2002 farm bill, the investment that has been made by those across this country in this growing industry that has enabled us to save money in the form of farm program payments. But just as importantly, it has enabled us to lessen our dependence upon  foreign sources of energy--7.5 billion gallons of ethanol by the end of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does that mean in terms of our dependence upon foreign oil? In 2006, the production and use of ethanol in the United States reduced oil imports by 170 million barrels, saving $11 billion from being sent to foreign and often hostile countries. By the end of 2009, ethanol production is expected to increase to 12.5 billion gallons, displacing even more of our Nation's petroleum use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Promoting clean, homegrown fuels and reducing our dependence on oil imports from dangerous parts of the world is more than just good policy, it is a matter of national security. So this farm bill, with its strong energy policy, moves us in a direction that not only builds upon the gains and the success we have seen in the form of corn-based ethanol, and the 7.5 billion gallons that have already been produced in the form of corn-based ethanol, but it opens the door to a whole new generation of  ethanol production in this country that is based upon other forms of biomass, whether that is corn stover or corncobs or switchgrass or wood chips or other types of biomass that we have an abundance of across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is just flat necessary and important and imperative for us to continue to diversify our energy in this country away from our dependence upon foreign petroleum so the American consumer can access the energy, the fuel they need to get to their jobs, to work, to recreate--to do all those things--in a less expensive way but, more importantly, so we are not dependent on countries around the world whose intentions toward the United States can be described as nothing less than hostile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, we kick off this debate. There are amendments I think that will be offered by some of our colleagues, some of which are already pending at the desk, others of which will be offered throughout the course of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. The Senator from Colorado, I think, perhaps, has someone to recognize for an amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Dakota for his leadership on this bill. As he said, this has been a bipartisan effort. This bill came out of the Agriculture Committee on a voice vote. And the Finance provisions, which have now been included in this farm bill, also came to this floor with a very huge bipartisan voice of support. So I am hopeful we can move forward quickly to get to a point where we do have final passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate and thank Senator Reid, our majority leader, for having worked with the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, having brought us together last week so we were able to finally move forward with a set of amendments that will get us moving in the direction where we can finally bring about a finality to this very important bill for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from South Dakota for his leadership, as well, on all the energy issues because we have worked a lot on these energy issues not only in the farm bill but in other aspects of our work here. At the end of the day, how we can have rural America help us grow our way to energy independence is one of the great opportunities we have as a nation. I look forward to working with both my Democratic and Republican colleagues as we try to do this effort on this bill through its energy provisions,  as well as trying to deal with the Energy bill, hopefully, later on in the week.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I call up my amendment, let me thank both the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from South Dakota for their leadership in getting this very important new ag policy to the floor. I, like they, have been frustrated the last month that we could not get on the bill and cause it to work its will. That is where we are today. We are on the bill, ready for it to work its will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do appreciate the comments the Senator from South Dakota has made and thank him for his leadership as it relates to the biofuels issue, to ethanol. Because of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we have expanded and accelerated--along with agricultural policy--this issue. As you know, if we can pass the Energy bill with the renewable fuels standard, we will go to potentially 15 billion gallons a year in ethanol in the outyears, and hopefully 15  billion  plus 6 billion in the outyears of cellulosic biostalk ethanol-based fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Energy bill cannot work its will, then the Senator from South Dakota and I and Senator Domenici from New Mexico, who just passed through, will attempt to put on the farm bill the renewable fuels standard, which is phenomenally important to the continuation and the growth of the biofuels that will make us increasingly independent of those rogue nations and of what I call the "petronationalism" that is sweeping the world, in the fact that if you are a small country and you produce  oil, you can take a big country like ours and jerk it around right by its nose, if you will, simply by pricing the oil that you know is so sacred to the developed world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, with the phenomenal runup in commodity prices in the last several years, in part because of what the Senator from South Dakota has said--the high value of corn, as corn moved out of feedstock, if you will, into a new kind of feedstock, to ethanol production--farmland and farmland values have gone up tremendously. A farm that had been a second- and third-generation farm--for which, a decade ago, a farmer or his son or daughter might have said: We can no longer afford to farm  it; we are going to sell it into development--all of a sudden that land, as part of our energy base and part of our food base has become increasingly important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. President, at this time I call up amendment No. 3640 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the bill talks about land, it talks about valuable farmland, it talks about valuable grazing land, and the issue is eminent domain. As we all know, the issue of eminent domain was elevated greatly as an issue following a highly controversial 2005 Supreme Court decision known as Kelo vs. The City of New London. Since that decision, we as a nation have allowed State governments and local municipalities to utilize eminent domain to force landowners to yield their property  to private development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a new phenomenon in our country. That has not been and was not the historic use of eminent domain. We are talking about land that maybe generationally has served America's farmers and ranchers for the purpose of food and fiber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As shown in this picture, here is an example of a beautiful piece of pastureland in Camas County, ID, for which one day the county and/or a city in the area could decide: Oh, gee, we like it for open space. It is open space today. As I would suggest, the economics of today would suggest it will remain open space for a long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But since the Supreme Court's Kelo ruling, farmers and ranchers in particular have become vulnerable to State and local municipalities taking their property for economic development, open space designations, or other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent, most vivid happening occurred in the State of Pennsylvania, where over a 3-year period in Pennsylvania, a county government has been in a struggle with a local family over an attempt on the county's part to purchase a section of their farmland. When the negotiations failed, the county moved to seize the land using eminent domain, with the goal of turning the land into a park or an open space along, I believe it was, the Susquehanna River. Very recently, after 2 years of dispute over  the value of the land, the county withdrew its request, leaving the family without any kind of deal, with the family having spent thousands of dollars and years on endless amounts of litigation and court costs. There were no winners, but the family that had the farm still owns the farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of the American Farm Bureau's president, Bob Stallman--he says it this way, and I think he says it accurately--No one's home or ranch or ranchland is safe from government seizure because of the Kelo ruling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are now increasingly hearing of incidents in which States and local governments may be pushing the boundaries of what our constitutional power was designed to accomplish. I read often of farmers and ranchers being forced to fight to save their land from local governments looking to take it. The Pennsylvania decision, of course, is a great example of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we in Congress need to bring back common sense in determining when we use the power and what it is appropriately used for; and, of course, I am talking about the power of our Constitution in respect to eminent domain. What are we talking about when we talk about common sense in State and local governments, what they should or should not do: Does it make sense to take open space out of the private sector and make it open space in the public sector by simply a taking, if you will, by  the power of eminent domain? There are plenty of ways to assure that farmland and grazing lands stay as open space if the county or the government wishes to reward the landowner and establish a relationship with that landowner for the purpose of keeping that space open and available. But just to use the power of government for the purpose of crushing that private property owner's right is simply wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American Farmland Trust reports that every minute of every day, America loses two or more acres of farmland, and the rate is increasing as our population grows and expands. This farm bill and what it embodies now will tell you that farmland will probably become increasingly more valuable for the production of food and fiber. In many instances, we don't have an acre to spare. When our county governments decide they want to take it for the purpose of simply changing its ownership, that is greatly  frustrating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, many of our parks in this country are facing major budgetary shortfalls. To unnecessarily add more parks using eminent domain makes the problem worse, and to take private land to do so simply makes no sense. If the city wants to create a park, go find a willing seller and a willing buyer. That is the way it has been done historically--not to use the power of eminent domain given them, if you will, by the Kelo decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is very simple. For this reason, in offering it, the amendment will deter State and local governments from taking working agricultural land against the will of the landowner only to designate the same land as open space for parks and similar purposes. It is a very targeted amendment. It addresses only cases in which private working agricultural land is taken and turned into open space--a park or a preservation or a conservation area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen, fellow Senators: It does not prevent States and local governments from exercising their right of eminent domain. What we are talking about is that it does not prevent nor deter the use of eminent domain such as taking for what we have always viewed as a legitimate public purpose: power lines, schools, and similar projects of public value; rights-of-way, when necessary, for roads and all of that type of use. It does not even tackle the issue of taking private land for private economic  development. That is the Kelo decision. That fight, I have to say, is probably for another day. I hope my colleagues of the Judiciary Committee would grab the value of private land-ownership in this country and change and allow us to work our will on the law and not give municipalities and local governments the right of eminent domain over economic development, for a private purpose. But, as I say, that is for another day and another purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does this amendment do? It creates a strong but targeted financial disincentive for the local governments to get involved. This will cause State and local governments to stop and think when considering forcibly taking the working land of a farmer or a rancher in order to keep that property as open space. Every farmer and rancher reserves the right to voluntarily, of course, enter into an agreement; as I mentioned earlier, a willing seller, a willing buyer, into a land trust for the value  of keeping land private and all of those types of things but to allow it to remain as it is for the purpose of openness. That is already going on. That already has well established law as it relates to how that land gets used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe land preservation is a worthy cause. However, farmers and ranchers should not be forcibly removed from their lands simply to prevent them from making a personal decision about their private property sometime out into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me end by saying it is necessary for Congress to discourage the illogical and unwarranted use of eminent domain. I think that is very clear. Many of us were surprised by the Kelo decision, and we saw new precedent being set as it relates to government's use of eminent domain. I believe it is both illogical and unwarranted to forcibly take working agricultural land only to designate it as land as an open space or for a similar purpose. A farm bill is an appropriate vehicle to accomplish this  goal to protect our private property rights and our Nation's farmers and ranchers, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank Cori Whitman on my staff for working this issue. I also note the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Public Lands Council, and many others are recognizing the risk and the threat to private operating agricultural properties and are supporting this amendment to become policy in the new agriculture policy embodied in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for listening. I hope to gain their support as we work this amendment through the process over the balance of this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think there are a number of people who want to cosponsor this amendment, but I will handle those later--except for the two Senators who are here; I ask that they be original cosponsors at this time, as well as the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will try to be as brief as I can. A couple of weeks back there was much talk about the need to keep only relevant amendments in order on this farm bill. While there was much left to interpretation of what exactly "relevant amendments" mean, there can be no question that the Senate should debate and vote on my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This farm bill is called the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. I cannot think of an amendment more relevant to the economic security of the American farmer and energy security of the American people than an amendment to increase the renewable fuels standard. Since we passed the first ever renewable fuels standard in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, of which I was proud to be the floor manager and the leader, we have seen a surge in ethanol jobs and a surge in the construction of plants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006 alone the U.S. ethanol industry supported the creation of 160,000 new jobs while producing 5 billion gallons of ethanol. These are American farm jobs which help produce American fuels and help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We are not aware of this happening because we have a gigantic country. As for 160,000 new jobs and 5 billion gallons of ethanol being added to the American workplace, that is happening because of the gigantic disparity that has occurred in the cost of oil now  versus a year and a half or two ago. That is why there is so much activity in foreign countries where we have seen a whole country saying: We are going to build a brand-new country from top up full of hotels and motels, banks, and the like. That is oil money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People say: Well, it isn't hurting us yet. They still have--they are buying up our bonds. Well, I believe it is hurting us. I believe it is part of the crisis--problem with the dollar--not crisis yet. It is also part of the problem with the gross domestic product of the United States in that it is not going to be as buoyant in the future because so much of our basic wealth is going out of our country, and the price of oil that we are paying to whatever country produces it and sends it to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what my amendment does is changes--sets an annual requirement for the amount of renewable fuels used in motor vehicles, homes, and boilers. It will require that our Nation use 8.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2008 and progressively increasing to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Now, you understand wherever we use the words "renewable fuel," that means something else other than the crude oil that I have just been talking about. It means it is getting produced here or under our control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning in 2016, an increasing portion of renewable fuel must be advanced biofuels. Beginning in 2016, increased cellulosic ethanol--advanced biofuels include cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, and other fuels derived from unconventional biomass feedstocks, like sorghum. The required amount of advanced biofuels begins at 3 billion gallons in 2016 and increases to 21 billion gallons by 2022.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Advanced biofuels do not have many of the challenges that conventional ethanol does. The inclusion of advanced biofuels strikes a balance that will allow America to begin diversifying our fuel supply, both in the short term and the long term. That is why when supporting these same provisions in the Energy bill, the Renewable Fuels Association said they "strike the right chord, " noting that "such an investment in our Nation's energy future promises to spur the creation of new, good-paying  jobs" across our land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I seek to offer and that I have offered consists of the very same provisions that passed the Senate in June during consideration of the Energy bill--the then-Energy bill. That was not the Energy Policy Act. It was the next major bill. Some may ask, then: Why do I seek to offer the amendment on the farm bill? My answer is threefold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One, it is clear that the Energy bill has slowed down, largely because the House has passed two major provisions--a tax increase and a renewable portfolio standard--that are untenable to many in the Senate, and they have slowed the bill down. They have brought forth a discussion from the President of the United States that is unequivocal; that if those two provisions are in the bill, he will veto the bill. That is the renewable portfolio standard and the tax increases that are in the House bill.  They are not only untenable to the Senate, we ought to make the point over and over that they are untenable to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what good is it to have that bill and say we are going to do it or else? What is the "or else?" We are going to do nothing. We are going to pass something that will never become the law. I wish we could do something different so we would not have to adopt this Domenici amendment because it will be adopted on the other bill where it already lies and languishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the House Energy bill in many respects weakens the renewable fuels standard in the Senate Energy bill. Besides, if the Senate makes progress on passing the Energy bill and getting it signed into law, there would be nothing to prevent a conference from simply removing this then unnecessary provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this amendment is relevant to the farm bill and necessary now to reinvigorate an ethanol industry that is looking to Congress to extend this mandate as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in one sense, we have been a victim of our own success. Thanks to the 2005 Energy bill, rural America has answered the call for increased ethanol production. In fact, we have now exceeded the original mandated fuel in our fuel mix. For example, in 2006, the ethanol standard was 4 billion gallons. I think the two Senators on the floor played an active role in that and are fully aware of that. In fact, our domestic production of ethanol is 5 billion, far exceeding the billions of  gallons we directed. We can do more, a lot more, and the American farmer is looking for Congress to do more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last year, the price of ethanol dropped nearly 40 percent. The reason for this is simple economics. We have an increased supply and diminished demand in the marketplace. As a result, the construction of new plants has been delayed, meaning new job growth has been diminished and rural communities are looking to us to take action. We cannot wait for the Energy bill while rural communities are losing their opportunities. This amendment is not simply just relevant to the farm bill, it is  necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment. I further ask our leadership go to work today, which I am sure they will, and tomorrow on the Energy bill that went to the House. It was sent back to us not as a bill but rather as a message, and it does not do justice to the biofuels for energy. They ought to fix that and, at the same time, take the taxes out and take the 15-percent electricity mandate for alternative fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask sincerely that our distinguished leader take the lead in that and see that gets done quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and thank the Senators for letting me proceed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, very briefly--because it is the other side's opportunity--I thank the ranking Republican on the Energy Committee for bringing this amendment forward. It fits well in the farm bill. Last Friday afternoon, I spoke to that again. Clearly, this is an opportunity we cannot pass by. I would like to see it in the Energy bill and see this concept grow to 2022 and get us to 36 billion gallons. Corn based and cellulosic is absolutely critical. This is a market we created by public  policy and with public support. There is no question about it. This is a market that can continue to grow and develop, as long as Government advances it and stays out of its way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from New Mexico for bringing up the amendment. It is appropriate on the farm bill. I hope our colleagues will consider it as a plus to the overall growth of domestic American agriculture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico  for bringing the RFS amendment to the floor. I urge my colleagues to figure out a way for us to move forward with the renewable fuels standard we in the Senate embrace because it is the right way to move forward with an RFS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at many of the concepts we have dealt with in terms of growing our energy independence, the fact is the renewable fuels standard is key in terms of how we get there. We worked long and hard in the Energy Committee to come up with the concepts included in the Energy bill. In my mind, when I look at the Energy bill, which is being discussed in its final forms in the negotiations between the House and Senate, there were five pieces to that bill. I believe we can get to a point where  we have a bill that becomes a final and good energy bill, which passes the Congress and gets signed by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we are close, as I understand it, to moving forward with CAFE standards in the legislation that makes sense to the people who are leading this effort in both Chambers. The biofuels program, which at its heart is the RFS amendment Senator Domenici was talking about, is something that is essential and a key component to having a good energy package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The carbon sequestration provisions we passed out of the Senate, I understand, have been accepted by the House. It is important to move forward with that. I know conversations are going on with respect to the renewable portfolio standards. I wish to make a quick comment on the renewable fuel standard. We spent a tremendous amount of time dealing with that issue in the Energy Committee because it was so important on how we move forward. There was a recognition among the witnesses before the committee  that there was a limitation with corn-based ethanol. The scientists and the experts are telling us we can get to about 15 billion gallons of production with corn-based ethanol. But we know the future for America, and for us being able to produce ethanol</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The RFS we passed out of the Senate Energy Committee, with the leadership of Senator Bingaman, a great advocate and proponent of the RFS in the Energy bill, contemplates that we will produce 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels. That is 21 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol, the alcohol-based ethanol I spoke about earlier today. So I hope that, as these discussions move forward in the week ahead and we look at crafting a good energy bill for this country, the renewable fuels standard  Senator Domenici spoke about in his amendment is included in that energy legislation. If not, it seems to me we may want to look at including it in the farm bill because it is so important to the future of rural America and to us being in a position where we can help grow our way to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor. My friend from South Dakota has additional comments.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I, too, acknowledge the good work of our colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, on this issue. It largely is a result of his good work in 2005. Senator Salazar is on the Energy Committee. I was, at the time, on the Environment and Public Works Committee, which worked to get the first ever renewable fuels standard put into law. That was a monumental breakthrough in terms of renewable energy production in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you look at the way the market has responded to that, the story has been nothing less than remarkable. In 2005, we set a goal of reaching 7 1/2  billion gallons of renewal fuel production by 2012. We will achieve that by the end of this calendar year, 2007. South Dakota will have, on its own, a billion gallons of ethanol production reached by the end of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a great success story not only for agriculture and for the farmers and the rural economies that benefit but for our environment because it reduces greenhouse gases. It is a great success story also in terms of lessening our reliance upon foreign sources of energy. I mentioned the statistic earlier: 170 million barrels of oil were displaced by the amount of ethanol production in this country. That saved $11 billion that we would have shipped to one of those petro economies elsewhere around  the world that Senator Domenici referenced in his remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the renewable fuels standard that passed in 2005 was a breakthrough; it was a milestone piece of legislation in terms of launching this industry. But what is remarkable about that is we are up against the lid that was set in that 2005 bill of 7.5 billion gallons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is happening now is you have a lot of those who would invest in ethanol production in this country pulling back, not knowing what the future of the industry is. The amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, of which Senator Salazar and I are cosponsors, would increase the renewable fuels standard in 2008 to 8.5 billion gallons, which ramps it up in 2022 to 36 billion gallons. It is an amendment I believe is desperately needed. We hoped it would be included in the Energy  bill. There is a version of it in the Energy bill. It would be better than what we have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico is a far better solution, superior to what is proposed now in the Energy bill. I hope we could at least get the language the Senator from New Mexico has put forward included in the Energy bill, or adopted to the farm bill that is under consideration right now. It is that important to the rural economy, to agriculture, and, frankly, there isn't anything we do, next to the production title of the farm bill, that impacts agriculture  more than does the renewable fuels standard, to increase it to 36 billion gallons by 2022, relying largely on advanced biofuels, cellulosic ethanol. To help us get there, those are all important things to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One comment regarding the Energy bill. There is a renewable fuels standard included in that. There are a couple of troublesome provisions to many who support the industry. One allows the EPA Administrator to essentially modify and grant waivers to the renewable fuels standard, dependent upon "significant renewable feedstock disruption or other market circumstances." In other words, the EPA Administrator has total discretion when it comes to a waiver of this renewable fuels standard in the Energy  bill that is currently pending. So the language, as proposed by the Senator from New Mexico, would be far superior in terms of what this industry needs in terms of market signals and certainty going forward. So whether that is included in the Energy bill or in this farm bill, it seems that ought to be the direction in which we move in this industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing I will mention by way of importance, in terms of renewable energy, is not only the renewable fuels standard, which is critical to those who invest in this industry, but that Congress is going to send a message that the policy incentives put into place in 2005 are going to be extended and, in fact, expanded; second, that we begin to look at increasing the blends. Right now, about 50 percent of the gasoline in this country is 10 percent ethanol. Because of infrastructure constraints,  it is difficult to see us getting further than 11 to 12 billion gallons of ethanol produced and marketed in this country at the 10-percent level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we were to increase the blends to 20 or 30 percent, it would dramatically increase the market for ethanol in this country. Studies are currently underway by the EPA and the Department of Energy that I believe will in time demonstrate that not only does ethanol not impact materials compatibility, drivability, and not only does it not affect in any way or disadvantage emissions, relative to 10 percent ethanol, I think a lot of studies are actually finding that, ironically, the mileage is better  at E20 than even traditional gasoline. So those studies are in the works. When they are complete, I hope we can move quickly to implement higher blends. That is a critical component in the solution to the renewable fuels industry in this country and to lessening our dependence upon foreign sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every gallon of ethanol, every bushel of corn we are buying from an American farmer means that many fewer dollars we are sending to some petronationalistic economy somewhere else in the world whose intentions to  the United States, as I said, very well could be hostile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important amendment. I hope as the farm bill debate continues this week and these amendments that are currently pending are disposed of in one form or another, if we do not get a vote on this amendment that we can get the amendment accepted so that we have this marker in the farm bill in the event something should happen that would not permit the Energy bill to pass and, just as important, getting language in the renewable fuel standard that is better than what we see currently in  the Energy bill with regard to the waiver authorities that exist for EPA in the current Energy bill and the RFS is included in that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak generally about the importance of the farm bill. I wish to speak about three aspects of the bill. The first has to do with rural America, which is a part of what I have called "the forgotten America" since I came to the Senate nearly 3 years ago. Second is to speak briefly about the importance of the conservation provisions which are included in this historic legislation. And finally, I wish to speak generally about some of the  renewable energy provisions that are laid out in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, with respect to what we see happening in rural America, as we see on the chart behind me, there is a lot of red and a lot of yellow. Those are counties, some 1,700 counties in the United States of America, which have actually declined in population between the years 2000 and 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens around this country, as we look at the macroeconomic statistics that affect the United States of America, everybody says that all is hunky-dory and things are going very well. The fact is, for a long time when we look at places in rural America, there are counties and communities that continue to decline in their economic well-being, and the very vitality of rural America is threatened. When the vitality of rural America is threatened, the food security of this Nation is also threatened.  That is why when we have legislation such as the legislation before us, the farm bill, we see Democrats and Republicans coming together, many of us from rural States, many of us wanting to be champions of  rural America which we believe is so important, we see Democrats and Republicans coming together to say this is a bill which is critical for our future and a bill we must have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we look at those red parts of the United States that are on this map, they are counties, and the people who live there are suffering. Some of them are small counties, some of them are huge counties from a geographic point of view. What we will find in those counties will be people who are hard workers and who on average make less than $10,000 per capita than their counterparts who happen to live in the bigger cities. That is a $10,000 differential in terms of their per capita income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we will find in those counties is also a disparity in health care. There is less health care available to people who live in those counties than people who happen to live in the larger metropolitan areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also find a higher cost of living with respect to the prices paid for fuel and a whole host of other items in many of these rural communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope, as we work before the Christmas break, that we can understand this legislation is very important to the forgotten America. For me, what I like to do when I travel around the 64 counties of my State, is I like to go to many of these places out in rural Colorado where I know communities and counties are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have 64 counties in my State of Colorado. It is a large State, not much different than South Dakota in many ways. There are many places where one can drive down the main streets of these communities that were thriving a few years ago and now see half of the main street boarded up, and we see the pains of an economy that is suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next picture I am putting up is a picture of Merino, CO. Merino, CO, as we can see, is a town in my State which is not having the best of economic times. I would say at least half, perhaps three-fourths, of the main street in Merino, CO, today is either for sale or has many of its commercial establishments boarded up in the way that is depicted in this picture behind me. It is not only Merino; it is lots of other places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you get out into the eastern plains on our major interstate corridors and the town of Brush, CO--here is the town of Brush, CO. Again, this is the main street of Brush, CO, with one of its important buildings for sale. If this was the only building on the main street of Brush, CO, that was for sale, one would say that happens all the time; we often see real estate for sale. What happens is, when we go into the main street of Brush, CO, there is a huge percentage of the buildings on that  main street that today are for sale. This is a typical picture of community after community across nearly a thousand counties of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope one of the statements we can make together as Democrats, led by Senator Reid, and as Republicans, led by Senator McConnell, is that we do care about this forgotten America and that we are willing to invest in this forgotten America through the passage of this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, I wish to speak about the conservation provisions of this farm bill. All of us who have followed the history of farm programs and the history of conservation in the United States of America know there is no greater champion for conservation than Senator TOM HARKIN. He has  been a champion of the conservation programs in this farm bill from day one. This farm bill before the Senate today reflects very significant additional investments in conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my friend from South Dakota said earlier in his comments when talking generally about the farm bill and what it has done for hunters, he said there were 10 million pheasants in the State of South Dakota. That is an incredible contribution for people in our country who love to hunt. The Presiding Officer is a great hunter. I am sure he would love to go to South Dakota and get some of those 10 million pheasants. The conservation programs contribute greatly to the quality of life in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For my life, much of it spent as a farmer and as a rancher, I have always said that farmers and ranchers are some of the best environmentalists because they truly understand the importance of fighting for land and for water. They know that at the end of the day, unless they take care of the land and water they depend on, next year their livelihood is going to be taken away from them. So they know they have to take care of their soil. They know they have to take care of the water. They know they  have to take care of that place which is the very essence of their livelihood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This farm bill is a historic farm bill in terms of conservation because it invests more in conservation, in all the traditional programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program, the grasslands program, and a whole host of other programs that will let us make sure we continue to protect the land and water of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this picture behind me, we see one of the conservation programs funded under the EQIP program in my State of Colorado. It is an irrigation line ditch to make sure that water is not being wasted in the arid part of my State. For those of us from the western part of the United States, we know that water truly is the lifeblood of our community. They say in Colorado that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting. That is because we know how precious the commodity of water is in the arid  West.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Programs such as this conservation program under the EQIP program make sure we are being as efficient as possible in how we use water in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes beyond how we use water for irrigation, which is what is depicted in that picture, but it is also making sure we are helping ranchers with water tanks and cross fencing so we can make the most use of our resources. Here is a picture of an EQIP project which has put in livestock water tanks and also has put in cross fences in the northern part of my State. It is another example of one of our conservation programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next picture is of a wetland reserve program near Nathrop, CO. This is a picture of a wetland which was restored under the WRP that has been included in this farm bill and has been significantly enhanced. We know the importance of wetlands not only to wildlife but also to water quality. This wetland, which shows the Rocky Mountains with its snow in the background, is one of those wetlands that has been made possible through the investments we are making in the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in the conservation area, there is also a tremendous amount of training that takes place. This picture behind me is of farmers getting together, going through a training seminar in Colorado to learn more about how they can take care of their farms. It is a very successful program which is not only a program underway in my State but also in many other States around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to spend a few minutes talking a little bit more about the energy parts of this bill. I wish to talk about how important it is to my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we look at what has happened with the energy challenges we face in this country, I do believe that is one of those areas where this Congress has made significant, positive action over the last several years. We started it through the passage of the 2005 Energy bill, which was led by Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman. I had the privilege of sitting on that committee through many hearings that ended up with the 2005 Energy Policy Act we passed in the Senate. Last year,  we passed another Energy Policy Act that opened up lease sale 181 in the gulf coast and created the Land and Water Conservation Fund which is a very important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year we have an additional opportunity to move forward with passage of new energy legislation which we are all hoping happens maybe as early as this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my State, a lot has happened in the last 2 years. When we look at all the different aspects of renewable energy, we have done more in Colorado in a very short period of time than I have seen happen with almost anything else that has come to my State. All of us probably in this Chamber would like to claim that our respective States are becoming the renewable energy capital of the United States. In my State of Colorado, it is happening in a lot of different ways, in part through the national  legislation we passed in the Congress and in part through the initiative of the voters of the State of Colorado through the passage of an RPS which was adopted by the voters in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a picture of a wind farm located in Prowers County in Lamar, CO. It is one of several wind farms which have sprouted up across my State in the last several years. Some people may say these wind farms are important, but how much are they doing? In my State, by the end of the year 2008, our hope is that we will have about 1,000 megawatts of power being produced from these wind farms that have sprouted up throughout the eastern plains and northern Colorado. And 1,000 megawatts of power,  for those who happen to be watching today, if we want to put that in layman's terms, is approximately the amount of electricity that would be generated from three coal-fired powerplants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, in my State of Colorado, 2 1/2 , 3 years ago, there was almost zero electrical generation coming from wind. Today, we are on the verge of approaching a thousand megawatts of electrical power from wind. So we are just beginning to tap that potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it is not just from Colorado. I know in the plains of both Dakotas, as well as in Wyoming and a whole host of other States, the State of Texas and others, we see wind energy becoming a very integral part of the portfolio for renewable energy for our future. This farm bill creates significant incentives for us to continue to enhance our efforts with respect to wind power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another quick example of a smaller set of wind turbines that are now up and functioning in the State of Colorado. We have included in this legislation amendments that will allow for a credit to be provided for what we call small wind microturbines. Those are microturbines that will produces less than 50 megawatts of power. Actually, that is less than 50 kilowatts of power. And with those small microturbines there will be enough electricity generated from these small wind generators to  be able to provide the energy that is needed at a farm or a small industrial park or those kinds of smaller uses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there is a whole future, which is a very positive future, on wind energy that is being embraced in this legislation. And as we have spoken about energy on the floor this afternoon, we also have spoken about ethanol and cellulosic ethanol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago--it was less than 3 years ago--after having been sworn in with my colleague from South Dakota, I went back to Colorado and said: There is a lot of excitement from many of my colleagues about ethanol and about the future of biofuels in America. I want to go and visit an ethanol plant somewhere in my State of Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was told at the time that we did not have ethanol plants in my State of significant size. Well, that has changed dramatically just in the last 2 years, in part because of the passage of the 2005 Energy Policy Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we produce over 100 million gallons of ethanol a year. We are at 100 million gallons of ethanol per year. The picture behind me is a picture of an ethanol plant in Sterling, CO. When I went there 2 years ago, there was nothing but an empty field outside of the town of Sterling. The town of Sterling is located in a place that is part of that America that struggles to keep going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went back a year later and what is now a $50 million ethanol plant has been constructed there. It is an ethanol plant that has produced jobs for the local community. There are over 20 workers who work at this ethanol plant all the time. It has been good for the farmers because they have an alternative market for their corn which they bring to this ethanol plant. It has been good for the cattle feeders because they take the feedstock after the ethanol has been taken, then they feed it to the  cattle in Sterling, CO. So this ethanol plant is only one of four ethanol plants that we now have throughout the State of Colorado, and it is our hope in the years ahead that we will have many more of these kinds of plants that we will actually see in construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as we know, through the testimony we had in the Energy Committee, the testimony we have had in front of the Agriculture Committee as well, there are limitations as to how much ethanol we can actually produce through these kinds of plants, where that ethanol is derived from corn. That is why these advanced biofuels and how we move forward with this renewable fuels standard is so essential. That is why in the RFS that we included in our energy legislation we recognized that there was a 15-billion-gallon  limitation that would be coming from these kind of ethanol plants. And, therefore, when we talked about the advanced biofuels, we meant we would get 21 million gallons of advanced biofuels from cellulosic ethanol. And that truly is where the future for America is, in my view, Mr. President, relative to making sure we are able to grow our way to energy independence for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are now at a point where we are asking our colleagues to come and offer amendments. We have had a number of amendments that were offered and are pending from last week. We have also had a number of amendments which have been offered and are pending here today, and we would invite our colleagues to come down and speak about the farm bill and to offer any amendments they might have.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think we are almost up to our 20 amendments. I don't know of anybody else coming down on our side, although I know of a couple of amendments out there that may get offered. But we are very close to meeting the allocation we have under the agreement, and so I suspect if there are others who want to have their amendments called up, if they can get them down here, we will get them put in the queue and made pending so that when everyone is back tomorrow we can, hopefully,  move to consideration based on those amendments, start getting them voted on, disposed of, and, hopefully, get to a final vote on the bill by the end of the week. That is my hope and certainly the hope of the Senator from Colorado, and I hope that is the view that is shared by our respective leaders as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say, too, again, by way of general observation on the bill, as my colleague from Colorado has talked about, many of the different titles in the bill--and we have both covered a lot of the energy provisions which he has spoken at some length about--the conservation title, the commodity title, and as we were discussing earlier today, 67 percent of the funding of the bill is in nutrition programs, food assistance, and other types of programs; about 9-plus percent in conservation, about 14  percent, actually, in the commodity title, which supports production of agriculture, and then there is a rural development title. But in any event, it is a fairly balanced bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think much of the emphasis on this bill, a new emphasis at least, has to do with what the Senator from Colorado had talked about earlier, and that is the renewable energy industry. I don't know that there are a lot of differences between this bill, if we can get it through the Senate, and what has already passed the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some things that are different in the two bills, but I think these are very reconcilable bills. And I guess my hope has been all along that we would be able to get a bill to conference and on the President's desk before the end of the year. That may be a little optimistic, but I think it is important we, at least in the Senate, act on our version of the bill, get it passed, clear that hurdle, and hopefully put us on a glidepath to getting a bill signed into law if not by the end of  the year, then sometime early next year so that producers can begin to make decisions about next year; that we don't have to go through the exercise of passing an extension of the 2002 bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we have a good bill before us. And now that we finally have an agreement to move forward with amendments, I hope we can get this bill through the process and perhaps passed by the Senate if not this week certainly early next week, and that will put us on a pathway to getting a bill signed into law by early next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said before, in addition to the farmers who are looking and anticipating the passage of this bill, and those who depend upon other titles in the bill, the renewable energy industry does need some action on some of the provisions not only in this bill but that are pending in the Energy bill. A renewable fuels standard needs to be enacted either as a part of the Energy bill or the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate passed earlier this year as part of its Energy bill a 36-billion-gallon renewable fuels standard by the year 2022. The House did not have a provision on a renewable fuels standard under its version of their bill. After the two sides got together, the Energy bill now contains a renewable fuels standard; although, as I mentioned earlier, one with some provisions and some conditions imposed on it that I think make it less preferable to many of us than the renewable fuels standard amendment  that has been offered to the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to the point my colleague from Colorado made about other forms of energy, we, too, in South Dakota have enormous potential to benefit from wind energy. We have wind energy. And I have seen studies--in fact, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado suggests that South Dakota is the windiest State in the Nation. We have the best wind for wind energy development, exceeding all other States in the country. Many of our constituents would probably argue that it exceeds the amount of  wind and hot air that comes out of Washington, DC, but if you look at where the end wind in this country is generated, it is in that middle section of the United States, and that, too, holds enormous potential for us to get away from depending upon foreign sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our constituents in the Midwest rely on fuel oil for their winter heating. You have, of course, a lot of energy that is generated from sources that are less environmentally friendly than wind energy. And so I would hope the provisions in this farm bill that provide incentives for small wind, and then some provisions in the Energy bill that include incentives for larger wind farms and types of projects--production tax credits, the clean renewable energy bond program--that those, too, could  get enacted and we could continue to move forward toward the development of more renewable energy in this country and less dependence upon foreign sources of energy from countries that would do us harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again commend to my colleagues, when we get to a final vote, that the energy title of this farm bill is critically important--not to just those who are investors in ethanol plants but, I would argue, to our energy security and to our national security as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't see anybody else here to offer amendments. If the Senator from Colorado would like to make some comments?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Colorado is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I note that the unanimous consent agreement under which we are operating in consideration of the farm bill allows for 20 amendments from the Republican side and 20 amendments from the Democratic side. I understand we are, on the Republican side, almost at the number 20 of amendments that have been offered and called up. On the Democratic side, there have been four amendments that have been offered and called up. If any of our colleagues are here and want to come down  and help us move this process along, we urge them to come to the floor and offer and call up their amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that we are down to 20 amendments on the Republican side, 20 amendments on the Democratic side, is a very good step in the right direction. There were approximately 300 amendments that were filed on this bill. There is no way in which we were going to work our way through those 300 amendments, so narrowing down that universe in the way we have has been very helpful and hopefully will get us to where we all want to get; that is, to get to a farm bill that can be finalized in this Chamber  so we can start working toward getting a farm bill that will help guide the farm policy of this country for the next 5 years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SALAZAR) Without objection, it is so ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator temporarily taking the chair for me at this time so I can make a few brief comments on the farm bill. I thank everyone who has been involved in getting us to this point. It has been challenging, but we have a product, as you know, that came out of committee unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Chambliss for their leadership in bringing us to this point. I also thank Senator Conrad for his budget expertise that helped get us to this point, and so many other people who have worked very hard to create a product that we all can be very proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not only support traditional agriculture, which is very important--people in my State think of automobiles, particularly as we are talking about the energy debate now--but our second largest industry is agriculture. So this is a very important bill from the standpoint of the economy of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have traditional agricultural programs that are supported in this legislation which I am very pleased about. But we also do something very important. We take a step toward the future in this bill in a number of ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also very important to me and Michigan, and I appreciate my colleagues supporting the effort, is to have half of the crops grown by farmers in the United States, fruit and vegetable growers, called specialty crops, included in a very real way for the first time in this farm bill. That is historic. We are talking about many family farmers, folks who are growing the apples and asparagus and the cherries and the blueberries and the oranges and all of the foods we want our children to eat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We tell our children: Eat your fruits and vegetables. Well, this farm bill for the first time makes a permanent place, a permanent home for those growers. I appreciate my colleagues who have worked with me in order to be able to make that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also take a turn to the future with alternative energy. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer from Colorado for his passion around the issue of alternative energy as well as my distinguished colleague from South Dakota for his interest and leadership around these issues as well. We all join together in understanding that we want to be able to say: Buy your fuel from middle America instead of the Middle East. That would create energy independence. It would be great for our  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="15054">S15054</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also are very proud to be making the automobiles that will use that new fuel. So this farm bill is an energy and security bill, an effort in a very major way to turn us to that future through various kinds of incentives and supports and research and cellulosic ethanol that we know is the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We not only want to make ethanol from corn--and we grow a lot of corn in Michigan, but we also grow a lot of sugar beets, we have a lot of wood byproducts, we have a lot of switchgrass available and other things that we can use for the technology to be developed and supported through this farm bill to be able to create energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is important. This is about the future. I believe part of reform, when we talk about reforming the farm bill, we talk about more focus on our fruit and vegetable growers, more focus on energy crops, more focus on nutrition, and the importance of being able to support our farmers markets and community gardens, the ability for people to have access to nutritious food in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is also an important bill for conservation. Again, I know our Presiding Officer cares very much about this issue. Our chairman has been a passionate leader, focusing on conservation. This bill does it in a very real way. I thank the chairman as well for including language that addresses Great Lakes water erosion, soil runoff into the Great Lakes, into our water systems, a very critical issue. I appreciate him including language from a broad strategic effort that was put together with all  eight States and our friends in Canada and the administration and others to put together a strategy to protect our Great Lakes waters. Part of that is reflected as it relates to our conservation portion of the farm bill. So there are numerous ways in which this particular legislation, as comprehensive as it is, makes sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also be remiss if I did not mention rural development. I do not think there is a town in northern Michigan, southern Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula, that has not benefitted by some help with water and sewer or housing development or small business loans or the ability to buy a needed fire truck, to be able to meet rural needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud of the fact that we have expanded and included the broadband access. We know, just as the telephone system was made more valuable by making sure the farmer at the end of the road was able to be connected by telephone, we need to be sure that every person in every corner of the country is connected and has access to broadband. This legislation does that as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are numerous provisions in this legislation that relate to supporting and developing rural America, supporting new technologies, supporting the communities, protecting our natural resources and conservation, focusing on alternative fuels and energy independence at a time when we have never needed it more; also the wonderful partnership that we have established between our nutrition programs, schools, seniors, community programs, and our fruit and vegetable growers who are growing that nutritious  food that we want to make sure gets to our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will come together. It is very positive that we finally broke through the logjam, and we are together here on the floor moving forward this bipartisan bill. It is my hope we will be able to move through these amendments and do it in a way that allows us to complete this bill this week  and have the Senate's vision for the future of rural America and energy and nutrition, conservation, our support for traditional agriculture, have all of those visions out there together before we leave for the end of the year. This is important what we have done together. It is an important piece of work. I am pleased that we are now moving to that next step. I am hopeful that working together, we will be able to get that done this week.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, we have had a number of folks here today who have spoken to different aspects of the farm bill. All are relevant, and everybody has a unique interest in this legislation. Many people come to a farm bill representing agriculture States and, therefore, have a keen interest in the commodity title of the bill, that part of the bill that directly affects production agriculture. Many are involved in food assistance programs and, therefore, interested in that aspect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken at some length today, as has my colleague from Colorado, about the energy title of the bill which we also believe to be critically important to the future of agriculture and rural economies. I do want to speak to one other aspect of the bill that Senator Salazar also spoke to earlier today. That is the conservation title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the aspects of this bill that is as critical to production agriculture as the commodity title is the conservation title. The conservation title of the farm bill comprises only about 9 percent of its total cost, yet it potentially affects more than 350 million acres of land. This is a photo of a piece of ground in South Dakota. This picture was taken in 2007. It is a great example of the role played by the farm bill's conservation title. The best land in this photo is planted with corn,  the low-lying wetland area being enrolled in a Conservation Reserve Program. We have an example of crop production and conservation working hand in hand. You have CRP in the foreground, wetland and corn ground in the background. The CRP on this farm and the million-and-a-half</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to contrast that and focus on another picture taken in South Dakota in 2007. This one actually, believe it or not, was taken in March of this year. If you look at this, at first glance you would believe that was a picture that was taken during the "dirty thirties," the time of the Great Depression. Actually it is the result of native sod in South Dakota that was cropped because crop insurance provided an unintended incentive to convert marginal pastureland or native sod to cropland.  This picture sends a stronger message than any words could about the inherent need to take care of our land. The topsoil and the fence line and ditch along this South Dakota field took literally millions of years to create and one dust storm to remove. The damage you see here simply cannot be undone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A sod-saver provision in the farm bill we are considering will prohibit anyone from converting native sod to cropland. What this sod-saver provision will do is eliminate the incentives found in current Federal farm policy that encourage unwise farming practices which result in the consequences that are shown in this photo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next photo is a picture that is an example of some of the native sod that is being converted to cropland in South Dakota. For the past 100 years, millions of acres of prairie have been converted to productive farmland. Most native sod that can be productively farmed in South Dakota and other prairie States has already been converted to cropland. We faced a shortage of money to write this farm bill. I don't believe it is wise to use Federal funds to pay for crop insurance and disaster programs  on this type of land. If the farmer who owns this land wants to crop it, wants to farm it, he or she is free to do so. But let's not subsidize it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next picture comes from South Dakota as well. This was a couple years ago in 2005. Dust storms, obviously, were not limited to the 1930s. This picture was taken in South Dakota in 2005. Once again, the consequences of unwise land stewardship practices are disturbingly evident. During the 1930s, South Dakota received billions of tons of Kansas and Oklahoma topsoil, much of it still in place in fence lines and fields. The programs we have drafted in the conservation title of this farm bill,  if funded adequately, will ensure that Kansas and  Oklahoma farmers no longer see their topsoil blow to South Dakota, and South Dakota farmers will keep their topsoil in their fields and not in the ditches and fence lines, as we see in this picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to emphasize this one more time: Production agriculture and conservation should not compete. Rather, they should complement each other. Every agricultural area in this country is blessed with productive land and land that needs help to keep from polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe. I ask those who are so critical of this farm bill to take a close look at the conservation title and what it does for all Americans. In spite of the budget cuts that made drafting this farm bill  more difficult than writing any other farm bill has been, I am pleased that my colleagues and I have been able to come up with a farm bill with a sound conservation title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out once more the benefits of the conservation title of the farm bill. First, it protects and enhances our soil and land. Secondly, it helps provide an economic alternative to placing costly fertilizer, seed, and chemicals on unproductive cropland. It also enhances recreation and boosts local economies, as is true in South Dakota, with a very robust recreation industry that is created by the abundance of pheasants we have had in the past few years and the $153 million that it  contributes to South Dakota's economy. I believe it is important that we take a breather from some of the controversy that surrounds farm bill debates and focus on the farm bill's proven capabilities to enhance rural America and to improve our Nation's water and soil. The conservation title of this farm bill will do that. This is one of many reasons that this farm bill deserves the support of our colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think there is much we do around here in terms of public policy that has as much impact as what we do in this farm bill in the conservation title when it comes to environmental stewardship. The conservation title is so important. The programs that have been enumerated, the Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Grasslands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Improvement Program, or EQIP, which is used by livestock producers, all these programs are designed  to lessen the impact of soil erosion, wind erosion, and improve the quality of our water. The sod-buster provision in this farm bill also moves us toward a policy that discourages those from cropping areas that should not be cropped simply to take advantage of programs such as crop insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the conservation title in this farm bill is a critically important component of the overall farm bill and one that I hope people, as they look at the farm bill in its totality, will take a very good, hard look at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationwide, without a conservation title, we would have 13.5 million fewer pheasants, 450 million tons of topsoil disappearing every single year, 2.2 million fewer ducks, an additional 170,000 miles of unprotected streams, and 40 million fewer acres of wildlife habitat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, if you look at what can happen when conservation programs and production are used to complement each other--and here, as shown in this picture, is another example of a field in the background and a CRP--or grasslands--in the foreground. But that is the kind of balance we try to achieve in this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conservation title in this farm bill is important. It is only 9 percent of the money, but it impacts 350 million acres of land in this country and adds so much to our economy and to the concerns we have about protecting and preserving our environment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I know for most of the day today we have been speaking about the importance of the 2007 farm bill, which is about food, about fiber, and about our fuel security. It is a very important piece of legislation. We are very hopeful we will be able to get a farm bill completed very soon that can then go to the President for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to spend a few minutes talking about another piece of legislation which many of us have spent a great deal of time working on over the last year under the leadership of Senator Bingaman; and that is the Energy bill which came through this Chamber with a very significant, bipartisan vote and which is a very good bill that moves us forward into the new era of a clean energy economy for the United States that will help us lead the world on how we can embrace the clean energy economy  for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my point of view, when I look at the reasons why we need to move forward with this clean energy economy, it comes down to three very simple reasons. The first is our national security, the second is our environmental security, and the third is the economic opportunities for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the first of those principles, when we think about what has happened to America since the 1970s and beyond, it is that America has slept. America has slept while we put our heads and our necks in the noose of the powers from foreign countries that are the petropowers that essentially control the oil resources of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us will remember when President Richard Nixon stood before the country and coined the term "energy independence." His view was that because of the formation of OPEC, we in the United States of America were in a position where what we were doing was abandoning the possibility of our independence because of the formation of this very powerful cartel called OPEC. So he said: We have to be energy independent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us in my generation will remember the nighttime prime-time speech President Carter gave where he spoke about the moral imperative of energy independence. He called it the equivalent of war, that it had the same kind of moral equivalency in terms of us moving forward with energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet what has happened from the 1970s, through the 1980s, through the 1990s, and here as we begin this new 21st century, is the fact that we have gone from a point where we were importing 30 percent of our oil from foreign countries to the point where today, in March of this year, 2007, we imported 67 percent of our oil from foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is 67 percent of our oil from foreign countries. So when you think about what has happened, those warnings and the visions that were set out by President Carter and President Nixon simply have not materialized. The United States of America has had a failed policy on energy, and it is high time that we in Washington, DC, in our Nation's Capital, take the bull by the horns and put us in a position where we can move forward with a new ethic and a new set of programs that will get us to energy  independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, this President--with whom I disagree on a number of different issues--came to the joint session of Congress in his last two State of the Union addresses, and he talked about the addiction of the United States to oil and how it was time for us to get rid of our addiction to foreign oil. Well, he is right in that concept. Now, what we need to do is to have a set of programs that gets rid of that addiction to foreign oil. Our farm bill does that, as my friend from South Dakota spoke about,  and as I spoke about earlier, because we have a very robust energy title in this farm bill. But the energy legislation which was passed out of this body a few months ago also is a very good step in that direction because of the significant components that are included in it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when I look at the foreign policy issues--I, like most of my colleagues in the Senate, have traveled to the Middle East. I have traveled to Iraq three times in the last 3 years. I have been on the border between Lebanon and Israel, looking down at Hezbollah encampments. For all of us who are concerned about what is going to happen to the United States and its future, I think we all recognize the foreign policy implications of our addiction to oil.  I  asked myself--when I looked down at the Hezbollah encampments where I saw Hamas activities--where is that money coming from to fuel these armies to be able to be created, and where is the money coming from that is giving to them the kinds of armaments that they have today? The money is coming from us here in America as we pay $3 and $4 a gallon for gasoline or for diesel and $89 to $100 now for every barrel of oil that is imported into</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was only a short few days after I arrived in Washington that I received a visit from a conservative and a progressive in my office who asked me if I would join a number of my colleagues on an agenda called the Set America Free agenda. Those friends who came to talk to me that day were my former Senator and good friend from Colorado, Tim Wirth, along with C. Boyden Gray, who is one of the best known conservatives in this country. They said it was time for us to start working together--progressives  and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats--on an agenda to Set America Free. So the inescapable force of our own foreign policy and our need to be an independent America, that is independent from these forces of the Middle East and Venezuela--it is important for us to make sure we move forward with a strong program on energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second principle at stake in the energy legislation which is now under discussion has to do with our environmental security. The time for us to argue about whether global warming is here I think has passed. I think the scientific community concluded long ago that the issue of global warming was a real issue. Yes, we will have debates on the floor of the Senate. There are debates I know that were conducted in the EPW Committee in the Senate just last week about what is the best way to move  forward. But I think everyone has concluded we do need to deal with the issue. We do need to somehow formulate the best approach of how we are going to move forward to deal with the reality of global warming because otherwise it puts the planet and puts civilization very much in jeopardy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have foreign policy and our national security, we have environmental security which compels us to act, and then we have the economic security of our Nation and the economic opportunities that a clean energy economy also embraces. We have spoken about some of those opportunities on the floor of the Senate today. Some of those opportunities I have seen blossom in my own State of Colorado over the last 2 years in a way that I am very proud of, but I am also proud of the fact that they are  also blossoming in other places around the country. The National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO, is truly one of the crown jewels on renewable energy and efficiency. It is a place which has been visited by Democrats and Republicans alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Harkin, as the chairman of our committee, actually in the formation of the farm bill, spent some time at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, CO, as well  as those who visited it, as President Bush did a year and a half or 2 years ago, found the best in technology in terms of energy. They will tell you the only limitation we have in terms of how far we can go with the renewable energy revolution is the limitation that we impose upon ourselves. When you ask them to tell you candidly whether we can be in a position where we can develop 30 percent of our energy from renewable energy resources by the year 2020, they will tell you that if you want to,  we can, in fact, do it. So the scientists who have the best knowledge on the research and the technology tell us that a lot is possible in the renewable energy equation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, because we have developed these technologies, we are also seeing a lot of economic activity throughout our country. In my State, again, in Colorado, when you go to the land of the turquoise skies, my native San Luis Valley where the Sun shines about 350 days of the year, we have the largest solar electrical generating plant now in existence in the world. There are other efforts that are underway in places such as Bakersfield, CA, where a company there within the next 2 years will be able  to have completed the construction of a solar electrical powerplant that will generate 175 megawatts from one powerplant. So there is tremendous capacity underway that is being built all around the country as we harness the power of the Sun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also harnessing the power of the wind, as I said. In my State, we are on the verge of getting to the point where we can generate 1,000 megawatts of power from the wind. We are not stopping with the power of the wind. We are moving forward with ethanol and a whole host of other things that are happening in my State. So there is tremendous economic opportunity for America as we embrace a new energy future for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I believe the forces that drive the new clean energy economy for America, again, are national security, environmental security, and economic opportunity--very simple, very fundamental principles that should guide our actions in the Senate. When we talk to experts who are involved in this field, they can get very excited about it because in their eyes, what they see is salvation not only for our country but also for civilization in terms of how we handle this very important signature issue  for the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to spend a few minutes speaking about the Energy bill that we crafted in the Energy Committee which was amended with the Finance Committee provisions on the floor of the Senate. From my point of view, there were five key aspects to that legislation. The first was the increase in efficiency standards, the increase in CAFE standards which have not been revised now for 30 years in this country. The second was a renewable fuels standard that will help us usher in this biofuels revolution for  our country. The third is dealing with global warming by getting an understanding of how we can sequester carbon here within our country. The fourth is a renewable electrical standard or a renewable portfolio standard across the country. The fifth are the tax provisions that essentially function as a jet engine which allow us to move much of our policy forward that we articulated in that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that as we move forward we will not lose sight of these key measures of the legislation and that we get as close to as much of these key components of this legislation enacted into law as we can. I know if the discussions that are taking place now between the leadership of the House and the Senate are successful, many of these aspects of the legislation will, in fact, be addressed so we have the 60 votes to get a good bill out of the Senate and then get a bill on to the President's  desk that the President will sign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will make just one final comment on one of those five key aspects, and that, again, is the renewable fuels standard. The renewable fuels standard which we set at 36 billion gallons in that legislation that we passed out of this body is a very good piece of legislation. I do not believe the Senate should compromise on that renewable fuels standard at all. We went through a very thoughtful process to come up with that 36-billion-gallon standard. We had experts from around the country, including  from the National Renewable Energy Lab, coming in and talking to us about how we could achieve the limitation of corn-based ethanol at 15 billion gallons. We also heard from experts who tell us we are within a year or two away from being able to open the door to the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made the determination that is where the future of our energy independence lies--in the area of biofuels and transportation. So we said we can produce in a new RFS 36 billion gallons. That is a quintupling of the current renewable fuels standard which we currently have in place. That is the correct number because that is what the science will support. We know that because 15 billion gallons will come from corn, and 21 billion gallons will come from the advanced biofuels which we are pushing  in that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope those who are involved in dealing with the renewable fuels standard in the legislation which is currently under negotiation understand the importance of the RFS and how much work went into coming up with that 36-billion-gallon-a-year RFS that came out of the Senate Energy Committee which was adopted with a broad bipartisan vote on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the people of America would be delighted if we in the Senate, working with the House of Representatives, were able to complete the legislation on these two very important issues: to complete the farm bill and to get it done before Christmas, and to complete a good energy bill that will help us move forward toward energy independence and address these key, critical policy challenges that confront us. It is a signature issue for the 21st century. The clean energy economy is something  which we must embrace. It is something we do in both pieces of legislation that we have talked about today, the farm bill, as well as the 2007 Energy bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased that the leadership of both parties has resolved the issues surrounding consideration of the farm bill. I have been extremely frustrated with the delay up to this point. In my home State, thousands of Wisconsinites are waiting for this bill to pass as they prepare for the coming year. This is true for farmers, of course, but also for the hard-working people who run and depend on food pantries and other hunger relief organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know how hard the committee, particularly Chairman HARKIN and Ranking Member Chambliss, worked to draft this extensive bill. I am pleased that this bill would make some significant improvements over current policy in a number of areas. I have heard some suggest that, if this impasse continued, Congress ought to just extend the status quo for 2 years. Frankly, this would be a shirking of our responsibility, and would ignore the improvements made in committee, as well as those  that have already been, or may still be, added during Senate consideration. For example, the Senate committee bill would increase the reimbursement rate for the Milk Income Loss Contract, or MILC, program to 45 percent in 2009. Many Wisconsin farmers will benefit from this important increase in the MILC program's responsible safety net for small and medium dairy farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am acutely aware of the importance of the support programs for American farmers. However, there is plenty of room for improvement, and I know many of my colleagues agree. Many of us, on both sides of the aisle, have filed relevant amendments that would make reasonable changes to existing programs and spend our limited money more responsibly. I have crafted a moderate reform amendment that I am glad to have combined with a similar effort by Senator Menendez. I hope our amendment will  be considered by this body before the bill is passed, and look forward to supporting other reform efforts. The Senate should be considering these and other amendments to improve the bill, such as the payment limit amendment offered by Senators DORGAN and GRASSLEY.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee bill also provides significant investments in conservation, nutrition, and rural development programs. I especially want to highlight the nutrition programs, as the beneficiaries of Food Stamps, TEFAP, and other such programs would be among the first to see the benefits of a new farm bill, at a time when food and fuel prices are on the rise. The committee bill does much for these programs--including increasing the standard deduction for Food Stamps and indexing benefits to inflation.  I am encouraged by these important investments that provide a total increase of over $5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current problems facing food banks and pantries across the country demonstrate the need for an infusion from the farm bill. As many of my colleagues know, food pantries across the country that have long distributed TEFAP and other similar programs are finding that, this year, the same resources are providing significantly less food for their needy constituents as the cost of both food and transportation has eroded their buying power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, my staff got an email from an employee at Milwaukee Hunger Task Force, one of the largest TEFAP distributors in the State, which highlights this dilemma. He explained that they just ordered a truckload of TEFAP peanut butter at a cost of $37,000; a year ago, this same order cost a full $10,000 less. And it is not just peanut butter--the cost of a truckload of flour rose $7,000 in the same year; a truckload of tuna rose $8,000. I am sure my colleagues have seen some of the stories  in their State papers as I have in Wisconsin, announcing the bare cupboards at food pantries, shelters, and other hunger relief groups. The increases for nutrition programs included in the farm bill are vital for these groups and the Americans they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to supporting proposals to further improve support for farmers, enhance life in rural areas and increase nutrition. Several amendments would significantly address the needs of farmers and rural communities while making available additional funds for nutrition as well. For example, the proposed Dorgan-Grassley payment-limits amendment that I am pleased to cosponsor provides over $200 million for nutrition programs, including $56 million to index TEFAP benefits for inflation. Similarly,  my amendment with Senator Menendez provides $301 million for Food Stamps in the "outyears" of the next farm bill, 2013-2017, and about $70 million annually for purchase of local food through various nutrition programs including WIC Farmers market vouchers, the Seniors Farmers Market Nutrition Program, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope those Senators who were delaying consideration of this bill--which helps millions of Americans, farmers and nonfarmers alike--will allow the Senate to have a fair and thorough debate on this important legislation. After all these months, any additional delay is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the information of all our colleagues who have been watching the debate on the farm bill today, and the amendments that have been offered, we are making significant progress based upon the unanimous consent agreement that was reached last week. We now have moved to a point where the 20 Republican amendments have been filed on the bill, there are five Democratic amendments that have been filed on the bill, and what we will do, starting in just a few seconds and  moving on into tomorrow, is move forward trying to get to a final point on this farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are hopeful and optimistic we are going to get this done. I think there is good bipartisan agreement. And I think this legislation, which Senator Harkin has championed as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, along with the assistance of Ranking Member Chambliss, will in fact move its way forward to a conclusion in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, December 11, when the Senate resumes <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>, it then return to the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment, No. 3711, and that there be 3 hours of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form, prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that no amendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote; that at 12:30 Tuesday, the Senate stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. for the respective party conference meetings; that upon reconvening at  2:15 p.m. the Senate resume the debate with respect to amendment No. 3711; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to amendment No. 3711.</paragraph>
