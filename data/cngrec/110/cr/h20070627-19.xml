    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, illegal immigration poses an immediate threat to our national security. Proponents of the new Senate proposal claim it would encourage illegal aliens in the United States to reveal their true identity and all affiliations they may have. My colleagues, this flies in the face of all reason, particularly when this legislation provides potential terrorists in the United States the simple option to create new identities with the help of our own government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within 180 days after the President signs the legislation, the Department of Homeland Security would start handing out probationary Z visas. Because the bill doesn't require the alien to produce a foreign passport proving his identity, these terrorists will have little trouble getting by the system with forged documents like a fake pay stub or utility bills. A potential terrorist could walk into a Customs office and offer a false, clean name, and then go about their business. This is wrong, Mr.  Speaker. That is why we should reject the Senate immigration bill.</paragraph>
