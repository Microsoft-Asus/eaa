  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the other side of the aisle is going to great lengths to make the case for retreat in Iraq. It seems they'll even ignore the facts if it helps their case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some time now, the other side has been saying that the war in Iraq is not part of the war on terror but a distraction from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the latest video released by al Qaeda's number two operative clears that up. In this latest rant calling for our destruction, Ayman al Zawahiri calls the violence in Iraq a jihad. He optimistically states that the situation in Iraq "is moving from the stage of defeat of the crusader invaders to the stage of consolidating a Mujahid Islamic Emirate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He goes on to proclaim that this victory for the terrorists will "raise the banner of Jihad."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the fact is that we are fighting al Qaeda terrorists in Iraq. And if we are unwilling to defeat them there, where exactly will we do so?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when we are honest about who we are fighting in Iraq, the implication becomes clear: We must win in Iraq.</paragraph>
