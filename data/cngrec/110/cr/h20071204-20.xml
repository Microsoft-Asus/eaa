  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hc" number="147">H. Con. Res. 147</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the Act of February 10, 1807 (chapter VIII; 2 Stat. 413), signed by President Thomas Jefferson, authorized and requested the President "to cause a survey to be taken of the coast of the United States . . . together  with such other matters as he may deem proper for completing an accurate chart of every part of the coasts";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Coast Survey was established to carry out the duties established under such Act, and was the first Federal science agency of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas over time additional duties were granted to such agency, including geodetic surveying and tide and current monitoring and predictions, and such agency was later renamed the Coast and Geodetic Survey;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in addition to providing charts and information vital to our young Nation's economic and commercial success, such pioneering agency led some of the Nation's earliest oceanographic research, undertaking surveys of the Gulf Stream to determine temperatures, depths, direction, and velocity, as well as the character of the seafloor and forms of vegetation and marine life;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the early technicians and scientists of such agency invented and supported the development of many innovative tools that led to advances in hydrographic, shoreline, and geodetic surveying and cartographic methods, the first real-time water level stations, and deep-sea anchoring;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas during the 20th century such agency, by then renamed the Coast and Geodetic Survey, advanced the development and marine applications of electronics and acoustics, including the development of Radar Acoustic Ranging, radio sono-buoys, and the Roberts Radio Current Meter Buoy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas throughout their history these programs have provided services in support of the Nation's commerce and defense, serving in all theaters of the Civil War and in World Wars I and II as hydrographers, cartographers, topographers, and scouts, including the production of more than 100 million maps and charts for United States and Allied forces;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas as our Nation's interests and economy became increasingly interwoven with the marine and atmospheric environment, a number of Federal science agencies with complimentary functions, including the Weather Bureau and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, were combined with the Coast Survey to create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas today these mapping and charting, geodesy, and tide and current data programs are located in the National Ocean Service of NOAA in the Coast Survey, the National Geodetic Survey, and the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these programs promote NOAA's commerce and transportation goals and continue to support the research, development, and application of state-of-the-art surveying, mapping, charting, ocean observing, modeling, and Internet-based product delivery services to promote safe and efficient commerce and transportation and contributing to the advancement of integrated ocean and earth observing systems;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these programs continue to demonstrate relevance, value, importance, and service promoting and employing innovative partnerships with other agencies, State and local authorities, academia, and the private sector;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these programs work internationally as the United States representative to the International Hydrographic Organization and through other organizations to promote integrated and uniform standards, protocols, formats, and services;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in addition to commerce and transportation these programs also advance NOAA's weather and water, climate, and ecosystem missions including marine resource conservation, coastal management, and the protection of life and property from coastal storms and other hazards, as most recently demonstrated in responding to and facilitating the recovery of communities and commerce in the hurricane stricken Gulf Coast; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the devotion, industry, efficiency, and enterprise of these people and programs over their 200-year history have set an enviable record of public service: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the Congress--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes that for over 200 years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its predecessor agencies have been providing to the Nation research to improve human understanding of the oceans and atmosphere, service, and stewardship of the marine environment, through products and services that protect lives and property, strengthen the economy, and support and sustain our coastal and marine resources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes the vision of President Thomas Jefferson in supporting the advancement of science, and the survey of the coast in particular, to the welfare and commercial success of the Nation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) recognizes the contributions made over the last 200 years by the past and current employees and officers of the Coast Survey, the National Geodetic Survey, and the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) encourages the people of the United States to salute and share in the planned celebrations of these historic programs during 2007 with ceremonies designed to give appropriate recognition to one of our oldest and most respected Federal agencies on the occasion of its bicentennial anniversary.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 147 recognizes the contributions that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the agencies which preceded it, together with their employees, have made in improving our understanding of the oceans and the marine environment. The resolution also recognizes the vision of Thomas Jefferson when he recognized that the survey of our Nation's coast is critical to our welfare and commercial success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month represents the culmination of ceremonies and commemorative events that have occurred across the country during 2007 recognizing 200 years of invaluable research, service, and stewardship of the marine environment provided by NOAA and its predecessor agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, I too recognize the work of NOAA's dedicated civil servants, the NOAA Corps, and NOAA's partners in fulfilling the NOAA mission. The agency benefits from the strong and able leadership of Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, the current NOAA Administrator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I want to thank my colleague and good friend from South Carolina, the ranking member of the committee (Mr. Brown), for his work in sponsoring this resolution. I am honored to join him in recognizing NOAA on this occasion, and I have enjoyed working with him this past year and am looking forward to our work together on the subcommittee in the next session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 147, sponsored by Congressman HENRY BROWN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Thomas Jefferson had the foresight in 1807 to initiate surveys of our Nation's coasts to promote the safe transport of vessels into American ports and along our Nation's coastlines. Since the mid 1960s, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has been responsible for conducting coastal and hydrographic surveys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 147 acknowledges the vision of President Thomas Jefferson and recognizes NOAA and its predecessor agencies for 200 years of research, service to the people of the United States, and their stewardship of the marine environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 3 minutes to my colleague, the gentleman from South Carolina, the author of this legislation (Mr. Brown).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>And I would also like to thank Chairman Nick Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young of the Natural Resources Committee as well as my colleagues on the House Science Committee for their support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 147 recognizes NOAA and its predecessor agencies for 200 years of research and service to the people of the United  States and its stewardship of the marine environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was the foresight of the third President, Thomas Jefferson, that started us down this path of surveying our coastal areas for the benefit of the Nation and laid the blueprint for what we now all know as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district is home to several outstanding NOAA facilities including the Hollings Marine Laboratory and the Coastal Services Center, both of which are located in Charleston. These facilities and their work are an important part of the coastal South Carolina community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NOAA has shown its dedication to our Nation's ocean and coastal resources. NOAA's management and conservation actions have allowed all of us to continue to enjoy our Nation's oceans and coastal resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on this important resolution, and I congratulate NOAA for their 200 years.</paragraph>
