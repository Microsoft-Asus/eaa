    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, following any time utilized by Senator McConnell and myself, the Senate will begin consideration of <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill>, the emergency supplemental legislation. There will be an hour of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Reid-McConnell substitute amendment. The time is also equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cloture vote will occur around 10:45. If cloture is invoked, and we expect that it will be, the Senate will immediately agree to the amendment and then go to a vote on the passage of the legislation. Therefore, there will be 2 rollcall votes expected this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the completion of the action on the supplemental, the Senate will begin debate on the conference report accompanying the budget resolution. Senators Gregg and Conrad have worked on this through the entire process. They are two veteran legislators, and they understand this issue more than anyone else in the Senate and probably in the country. We will have that vote, hopefully, around 3:30, between 3:30 and 4:30 this afternoon, if all things go well. We are waiting for  the House to pass it. I think they will do that around 3:30 this afternoon.</paragraph>
