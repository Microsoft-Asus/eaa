    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, proclamations and commemorations are a wonderful part of the job that we are honored to have. Elevation of certain historic events so that they are remembered and respected, particularly by our young people, is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one in Arkansas is unaware of the significance of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in 1957. No one in America should be unaware of the courage of the Little Rock Nine. That courage is celebrated in one of the two commemorative coins that are part of the U.S. Mint collection this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I come here this morning to let you know if you don't have your order in by December 14, which is the end of this week, you won't be able to order the coins from usmint.gov, or call 1-800-USA MINT. For you folks on the Hill, the Mint is having their annual Holiday Hill coin sale in Rayburn 2220, where you can buy this coin, and also the wonderful coin sponsored by the late Representative Jo Ann Davis honoring the 400th anniversary of Jamestown. Usmint.gov, and you, too, can send these as  great holiday gifts.</paragraph>
