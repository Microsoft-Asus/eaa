    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, I rise to urge Congress to support the Filipino Veterans Equity Act. This important piece of legislation will restore U.S. veterans status to the surviving soldiers of the 250,000 Filipinos who were called into military service to the United States Armed Forces by President Roosevelt on July 26, 1941.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the only 22,000 surviving Filipino World War II veterans, I want to highlight Faustino "Peping" Baclig, who currently resides in Los Angeles, California. Peping was among the 75,000 Filipino and U.S. soldiers subjected to the 90-mile trek from Mariveles to Tarlac, better known as the Bataan Death March. He survived the atrocities of Japanese occupation and fought side by side with the Americans, only to have his service as a U.S. national and a veteran denied by the 1946 Rescission Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We now have a unique moment to undo the injustice of that act and give honor and respect to this brave group of veterans. As Peping tells us, though, "They pay us to die, but they cannot pay us to live." For these men, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act will fulfill a promise we denied them for over 60 years, recognition of a grateful Nation that their service to our country is just as equal as the soldiers with whom they stood shoulder-to-shoulder on field of battle.</paragraph>
