    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago I introduced the Charlie Norwood CLEAR Act, which targets violent criminal aliens and gives local law enforcement the tools they need to get them off the street. This legislation now has bipartisan support and has 140 sponsors, cosponsors; and we are adding to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week I conducted a telephone town hall, and the overwhelming majority of the callers on that phone call demanded that Congress take action, take some action, not just talk about removing criminal aliens, but take action to get them off the street. This bill accomplishes that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we hear about the events that have taken place since September 11, Fort Dix, Newark, and in Arizona recently, we know it is needed. So I encourage my colleagues, cosponsor the CLEAR Act, <bill type="h" number="3494">H.R. 3494</bill>. Support ridding our streets and our communities of criminal aliens and absconders.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
