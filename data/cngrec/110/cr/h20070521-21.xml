    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of <bill type="h" number="1425">H.R. 1425</bill>, which names a postal facility in Odessa, Texas, after Marvin "Rex" Young.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1425">H.R. 1425</bill>, which was introduced by Representative MICHAEL CONAWAY on March 9, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on March 29, 2007, by voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 31 Members, has the support of the entire Texas congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 21, 1968, Staff Sergeant Marvin Young was assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion (Mechanized), 5th Infantry. He was leading a patrol when the 25th Infantry Division came under attack by a large force of North Vietnamese. The squad leader was killed, and Staff Sergeant Young assumed command and repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire to help his men. Despite orders to pull back, he remained behind to assist several of his men who were unable to withdraw. With critical injuries to his  body, he continued to fight to cover the withdrawal of his troops. The enemy engulfed his position, and he was killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Young's parents were presented the Medal of Honor at the White House on April 7, 1970, by President Richard Nixon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative MICHAEL CONAWAY from Texas for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to speak on the floor today to name a post office in Odessa, Texas, for a truly great American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marvin "Rex" Young was a genuine war hero at the young age of 21. He grew up in Odessa, Texas, and was quite athletic during high school, playing both football and baseball. A smart student, he also enjoyed art and spent time painting. His plans were to attend Texas Tech University after graduating from high school, but, unfortunately, he never got the chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rex Young joined the U.S. Army in September of 1966 and was deployed to Vietnam in 1967. He served with Company C, 1st Battalion (Mechanized), 5th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division as a staff sergeant. He was wounded twice during the war, once in December, 1967, and again in February, 1968. But it was on August 21, 1968, in a true act of heroism that he would provide the ultimate sacrifice for his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was acting as a squad leader on a reconnaissance mission in South Vietnam. His unit was attacked by the enemy and received a barrage of incoming fire. The forward platoon lost its commander, so Rex Young instinctively took command and organized his men into a defensive position, all the while under heavy enemy fire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In attempting to withdraw, he allowed his men to retreat while he stayed behind providing covering fire. It was during this action that he was critically injured. Heroically, he still managed to help the other members of his unit to retreat while continuing to cover for them. As more infantrymen pulled back, he remained behind to ensure their safe withdrawal. While the group fought its way back, he was hit again in the leg and in the arm. Fearing that seeking medical aid would slow down his team,  he refused it. It was there that he sacrificed himself for the safety of his comrades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was this act of selfless bravery, courageous leadership, and heroism that earned him the country's highest military award, the Congressional Medal of Honor. The medal was posthumously awarded to his family by President Nixon on April 17, 1970. It is for those same reasons that we name this post office for Marvin "Rex" Young in his hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask all Members to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1425">H.R. 1425</bill></paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague from the State of Texas and the person who introduced this resolution (Mr. Conaway).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next Monday, our Nation will pay tribute to all the young men and women who fought and died so bravely and honorably for our Nation. On Memorial Day, we will celebrate with parades and speeches and flag waving and fireworks, as we should. From the Revolutionary War to the war we are fighting today, we celebrate and remember the fallen as a group. For those of us who have lost a loved one in a war or through the service of this country, Memorial Day has a deep meaning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the family and friends of the men who served with Marvin "Rex" Young, the last Monday of May is much more than just symbolic. On this day, Rex's family and friends and fellow soldiers remember and honor his brave actions on behalf of his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 21, 1968, while in battle in Vietnam, Rex sacrificed his life to save the lives of his friends and comrades. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery and sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to honor the life and memory and heroism of Staff Sergeant "Rex" Young.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rex was born in Alpine, Texas, on May 11, 1947, the third and youngest child to Marilyn and Roy Young. Rex's mother has provided this picture of Rex serving in Vietnam back in 1967 and 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The family moved to Odessa when Rex was a child. I met Rex when we were both attending Odessa Permian High School. Rex was a year ahead of me and graduated in 1965. He was a gifted athlete, played both football and baseball while at Permian. His mother said Rex was more interested in just being on the team and contributing, but he was much more than that. He was a star player. Childhood friends remember Rex as an exceptional athlete who could have written his own ticket in baseball. And they  remember him as a very unselfish guy, so they were not surprised when he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery in battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduation, Rex attended Odessa College and Kentfield Junior College in California and then joined the United States Army on September 15, 1966. He completed basic training at Fort Bliss, Texas, and advanced infantry training at Fort Lewis, Washington, and then departed for Vietnam on October 20, 1967. He was assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion (Mechanized), 5th Infantry of the 25th Infantry Division, known as the "Bobcats." Rex earned his first Purple Heart from a shrapnel wound on  December 7, 1967; and he earned his second Purple Heart on February 1, 1968, during the TET Offensive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On August 21, 1968, Rex was killed by enemy fire as he provided protective fire to shelter elements of his platoon as they were withdrawn to safety. It was in these final selfless acts that Rex saved so many of his friends' lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jesus said in John 15:13, "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to read from the citation that describes Rex's final moments on this Earth:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Staff Sergeant Young distinguished himself at the cost of his life while serving as a squad leader with Company C. While conducting a reconnaissance mission, Company C was suddenly engaged by an estimated regimental-size force of the North Vietnamese Army. During the initial volley of fire, the point element of the 1st Platoon was pinned down, sustaining several casualties, and the active platoon leader was killed. Sergeant Young unhesitatingly assumed command of the platoon and immediately  began to organize and deploy his men into a defensive position in order to repel the attacking force. As a human wave attack advanced on Sergeant Young's platoon, he moved from position to position, encouraging and directing fire on the hostile insurgents while exposing himself to the hail of enemy bullets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"After receiving orders to withdraw to a better defensive position, he remained behind to provide covering fire for the withdrawal. Observing that a small element of the point squad was unable to extract itself from its position, and completely disregarding his personal safety, Sergeant Young began moving toward their position, firing as he maneuvered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>"When halfway to their position, he sustained a critical head injury, yet he continued his mission and ordered the element to withdraw.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Remaining with the squad as it fought its way to the rear, he was twice seriously wounded, once in the arm and once in the leg. Although his leg was badly shattered, Sergeant Young refused assistance that would have slowed down the retreat of his comrades, and he ordered them to continue their withdrawal while he provided protective covering fire. With indomitable courage and heroic self-sacrifice, he continued his self-assigned mission until the enemy engulfed his position. By his gallantry,  at the cost of his life, and which is in the highest tradition of military service, Staff Sergeant Young has reflected great credit on himself, his unit and the United States Army."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the heavy fighting that day, Company C suffered 17 men killed, 21 wounded. And no one knows how many other men would have died that day had Rex not stepped in to save his friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his gallantry and self-sacrifice, Sergeant Young was posthumously promoted to staff sergeant. Rex earned his country's highest award for bravery, the Medal of Honor. In addition to the medal, Staff Sergeant Young was awarded the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the Bronze Star with "V" Device, Purple Heart with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Military Merit Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with  Palm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rex was buried with full military honors at Sunset Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Odessa, Texas. Near him lie many other Odessans who perished in the Vietnam War. Fifty feet north rests another Medal of Honor recipient, Alfred "Mac" Wilson, Corporal, United States Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rex's sister Margaret now lies next to him. His brother Charles Ray and his father are also deceased. His mother lived in Odessa for many years. She has recently moved to McKinney to be close to her friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rex's last day on Earth was almost 39 years ago. Because he and I are close to the same age, I think often of all the experiences that I have had that he willingly gave up that hot, fateful day halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am loved by a wonderful woman, and together we have raised four children. I have watched them grow into responsible adults. I have watched the boys play football and basketball, baseball and golf. I watched my daughters lead cheers as a cheerleader and a team mascot. I have watched our sons take beautiful young women to be their wives. I walked one of my daughters down the aisle so that her mother and I could give her in marriage to a starry-eyed young man. I have held our seven grandchildren  in my arms and looked into the eyes of America's future. And I buried a wife and a father. These are life experiences that Rex should have had. All of these experiences that I know Rex must have looked forward to, the good and the bad, were sacrificed on freedom's altar in his heroic acts that day so long ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, next Monday our Nation celebrates Memorial Day, a day set aside each year to honor all of the Rex Youngs our country has produced and who have made that same supreme sacrifice that Rex made. This includes, of course, the brave men and women who for the past 5-plus years have stood between us and some very bad, soulless people that want to destroy our way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to challenge each of us that in addition to honoring these men and women as a group, that we think about them on an individual basis. By that I mean that each of us should have a specific person that we think about, honor and celebrate each and every time sacrifices are mentioned. It could be somebody in our family, it could be a friend or somebody that you know through a history lesson, but my challenge to you is this: That every time you are reminded of all the lives that have  been given in defense of this country, that you think about a specific life given. For me, Mr. Speaker, that life is Rex Young.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and gratitude that I ask this House to honor SSG Marvin "Rex" Young by naming the post office at 4551 East 52nd Street in Odessa, Texas, after him. By doing so, his memory will live on not just in the hearts of those of us who knew him, but also by everyone that uses or drives by that post office and sees his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His Nation honored him with its highest honor for bravery. I now ask that his Nation honor his memory by taking one more official act. I ask each of you to vote in favor of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it is very appropriate that this week, just before Memorial Day, we are honoring these several people who have sacrificed their lives so that the rest of us can be here and be free. I particularly want to thank Mr. Conaway for his comments about not just recognizing in a collective way the people who have given their lives and who have served, but who have done it in a personal way. This morning I had the honor to recognize Mr. Larry Bauguess, who has recently  lost his life in Afghanistan on behalf of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="1425">H.R. 1425</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to close, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for his introduction of this legislation. I also want to thank Mr. Conaway for his passionate description of the life of one of our heroes. I would certainly concur and urge that we pass this resolution. I am very pleased to support it, and I urge passage.</paragraph>
