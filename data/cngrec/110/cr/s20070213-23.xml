    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a very special place in my hometown of McCook, NE. It is a place which exemplifies the thousands of family-owned small businesses lining the main streets of every small town in America, businesses which are the driving force in keeping those towns economically viable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year marks the 50th anniversary of Sehnert's Bakery in McCook, NE. It was in 1957 when Walt and Jean Sehnert, the grandchildren of immigrants who came to America 110 years ago, bought the bakery as a place to work hard, earn a decent living, and raise a family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, their son Matt Sehnert and his wife Shelly carry on the tradition by providing the people of McCook with some of the most delicious pastries on the planet. Matt and Shelly credit a dedicated and hard-working crew, who also take pride in Sehnert's longstanding tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many small businesses do in order to survive in a competitive environment, Matt and Shelly have modernized Sehnert's Bakery and expanded it to include a catering service and cafe, where I often meet with constituents during visits home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My memories of Sehnert's go back to when I was a teenager in McCook and was able to get a job there, working early Saturday mornings. I learned a lot about how to make piecrusts and decorate cakes. I also learned that it is easy to overdose on glazed donuts when you work in a bakery Walt Sehnert can still recall my first day on the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My fellow colleagues, if you ever have the pleasure of visiting my hometown of McCook, NE, I urge you to drop by Sehnert's Bakery and enjoy some of their mouth-watering donuts, or maybe some pies or perhaps one of their famous "Jiffy Burgers," whose recipe remains a closely guarded secret in McCook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sehnert's Bakery and Bieroc Caf&amp;#233; Catering Service is located at 312 Norris Avenue. That is Norris, as in George Norris, who very capably served Nebraska in the U.S. Senate from 1913 to 1943. Yes, McCook has produced two U.S. Senators, as well as three of Nebraska's Governors. Not bad for a town with a population of just 8,000 people; but of course, that is why the Sehnerts and I are proud to call it home.</paragraph>
