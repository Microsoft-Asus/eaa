    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the crime of the week this week was not committed by some menacing outlaw, but it was committed by a repeat offender, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Texas parole board has been releasing violent offenders years before they are finished serving out their sentences, and then these violent criminals continue their lawless ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Keith Hines was supposed to be in the jailhouse for 30 more years for violent crimes against the citizens of the State, but the good old parole board gave him a get-out-of-jail-free card, and this was a fatal error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On December 5, Hines robbed a gas station at gunpoint in Humble, Texas. The robber then ran to his vehicle to make his getaway. Witness, volunteer firefighter and good Samaritan, Steve Jackson, jumped into his car and followed Hines while relaying to 911 the locations of the hijacker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Down the road, with Jackson in pursuit, Hines jumped out of his getaway car, ran up to Jackson's vehicle, shot Jackson twice and murdered him on the side of the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hines is now charged with capital murder. All this because the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles let this habitual offender go every which way, including loose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
