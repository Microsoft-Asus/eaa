  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks in the Record on this concurrent resolution.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 67, which establishes the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies during the 110th Congress to begin work on preparations for the Presidential inaugural ceremonies at the Capitol on January 20, 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The joint committee we are creating today expires on January 3, 2009, but will be renewed at the start of the 111th Congress to conclude its work. Congress routinely passes this concurrent resolution every 4 years. The Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader customarily represent the House on the joint committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage of the motion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="sc" number="67">S. Con. Res. 67</bill>, which will establish the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As everyone in this Nation knows, we are in the midst of an election year. It is a particularly exciting election year because it is the first time since 1952 that we do not have a presumptive heir apparent, and we have had considerable activity and considerable citizen interest. We are now at the point where the public is in the process of deciding between Senator McCain, Senator Clinton, or Senator Obama; and we will continue to have considerable interest in November.  In fact, I can almost guarantee that the public will be tired of the election process come next November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then we enter a new phase, a new phase of great excitement, and that is the inauguration of a new President of the United States of America. The inauguration of the President of the United States is not only an event that fills our own citizens with pride, but one that also demonstrates the power of democracy to the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chief Justice Roberts swears in our 44th President, the inaugural ceremony will once again prove that in a free society, no matter the size of its army or how mighty its leaders, a peaceful transfer of power is possible, a peaceful transfer engendered by the choice of the people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1901, all inaugural ceremonies at the U.S. Capitol have been organized by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This committee was formed to ensure that the activities surrounding President William McKinley's second inauguration were carried out smoothly on the Capitol Grounds, and it has been re-formed every 4 years since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current reconstitution of the JCCIC with each Presidential cycle is integral to the success of one of the most powerful and humbling symbols of our Nation's commitment to freedom from tyranny. It is a marvelous occasion, and I am struck by it particularly this week as another great nation, Russia, is going through the presidential election process, almost without campaigns, because the winners have been pre-selected. I am proud to be part of a Nation that does not do that, but that encourages  all citizens to consider the candidates and elect a citizen and a President of their choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the formation of this important joint committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
