  <narrative>ORDER OF PROCEDURE -- (Senate - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9819">S9819</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, wishes to speak as in morning business for a period of time of up to--how long? It does not matter. I would like to know.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would estimate 10 minutes, Mr. Leader.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the statement by the Senator from Virginia is completed--I ask the Senator from Virginia, would you rather complete your statement now? You are here ready to go; is that right?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator completes his statement--whenever that might be in the next 10 or so minutes, but that be today--the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of <bill type="hj" number="44">H.J. Res. 44</bill>, which was received from the House. I further ask consent that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees and that following the use or yielding back of time, the joint resolution be read a third time and the Senate  proceed to a vote on passage, without any intervening action or debate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, just briefly reserving the right to object, I was unclear if the majority leader was trying to get the Senator from Virginia up right now. I have a very brief statement related to the joint resolution we are proceeding to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, what I would suggest is--and I am sure my friend from Virginia would have no objection--the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, would make his statement, and it would be made as if during the half hour's time. Would that be OK?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>So you would make that now. I know you have things going on in your office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that OK with the Senator from Virginia?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is certainly OK with me. Thank you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>So I modify my request to let the Senator from Kentucky speak for however long he desires for up to 30 minutes on the Burma resolution; following that, we go to Senator Webb. I ask unanimous consent that my consent request be approved.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we now on <bill type="hj" number="44">H.J. Res. 44</bill>?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> My understanding of the consent is that the Senator would speak against the half hour that was allotted on the resolution. Then we would go back to morning business briefly for a statement from Senator Webb. And then we would return for the rest of the half hour of debate on the resolution the Senate will consider.</chair>
