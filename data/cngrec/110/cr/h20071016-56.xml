    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez is one of three deputies in Edwards County, Texas. This county is the size of Delaware.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While on duty at night recently in Rocksprings, Texas, an SUV ran a red light. Hernandez pulled the vehicle over. The vehicle sped off and then tried to run down Deputy Hernandez. He shot out the two tires in self-defense. It turned out the vehicle was smuggling nine illegals. One illegal was injured by a ricochet bullet. The Sheriff's Department and the Texas Rangers investigated the shooting and cleared Hernandez. But the Mexican Government demanded prosecution by the U.S. Justice Department,  and over a year later the U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted Hernandez for alleged civil rights violations. The nine illegals and the human smuggler were allowed to stay in the United States. Hernandez was convicted and sent to prison. But yesterday he was released from prison and returned home to Rocksprings, Texas as a hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
