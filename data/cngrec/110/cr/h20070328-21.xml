  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my home State of Michigan is currently experiencing really hard economic times. We have the highest unemployment in the Nation. We have the lowest personal income growth in the Nation, dropping home values, tightening family budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Government overspending, combined with declining revenue from the soft job market, has forced my State into a fiscal crisis, and our Democrat Governor thinks that the way to solve the problem is by raising taxes and increasing government spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in Washington, we also have a spending problem and a deficit that is too large. So what do the Democrats offer? The largest tax increase in American history, almost $400 billion, and massive new government spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats are also pushing arbitrary and draconian fuel economy standards that could decimate our domestic auto industry and cost even more Michigan jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the people of Michigan just cannot take it anymore. They do not need bigger government. They need bigger paychecks, and I ask the Democrat leaders to take pity on the citizens of Michigan. Please just give Michigan a break.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
