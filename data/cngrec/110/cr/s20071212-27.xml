  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express my support for Senator SPECTER's Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2007, <bill type="s" number="2243">S. 2243</bill>. I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, which addresses the importance of Saudi cooperation with the U.S. on counterterrorism issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important, however, that we raise concerns about Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, weak rule of law, ongoing political and religious repression, and poor treatment of women. For instance, last month a court in Saudi Arabia doubled its sentence of lashings for a rape victim who had elected to speak out publicly about her case and her attempt at justice. According to human rights organizations, the court also harassed her lawyer, banned him from the case, and confiscated his professional  license.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, 2 of the country's leading reformers, the brothers Abdullah and Isa al-Hamid, were recently sentenced to 6 months in jail after they themselves were arrested for reportedly requiring the Saudi intelligence forces to produce an arrest warrant when seeking to detain peaceful demonstrators protesting the lengthy imprisonment of their relatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Department's 2007 human rights report notes that very serious problems persist in Saudi Arabia, including no right to peacefully change the government; infliction of severe pain by judicially sanctioned corporal punishments; beatings and other abuses; inadequate prison and detention center conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention, sometimes incommunicado; denial of fair public trials; exemption from the rule of law for some individuals and lack of judicial independence; arbitrary  interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence; and significant restriction of civil liberties--freedoms of speech and press, including the Internet; assembly; association; and movement. In addition, the Saudi government committed severe violations of religious freedom and has very strict limitations on workers,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What message are we sending if we don't act on these pervasive human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia? Such abuses should not be overlooked or sidelined in the interest of national security. In fact, they are critical to our national security and our ongoing efforts to combat al-Qaida and related extremist threats. The United States must continue to push for freedom of speech, religion, and association, and the rule of law around the globe. I will continue to support <bill type="s" number="2243">S. 2243</bill>, but also encourage  my colleagues to also speak up about the crucial role that free and fair societies play in curbing human rights abuses and reducing the alienation, oppression and despair that feed extremism.</paragraph>
