  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DICK SMITH -- (Senate - November 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14482">S14482</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, from humble beginnings as a seasonal fire fighter in Wyoming in the 1970s, Dick Smith built a fine career and developed an outstanding reputation as a Forest Service employee over his 35 years at the Agency. He retired from Federal service this fall, after achieving the position of Forest Supervisor for the Boise National Forest. Although we are thrilled that he is able to now enjoy retirement, his absence will indeed be felt, to the detriment of the Idaho foresting  community. Before taking a position in the Clearwater National Forest, Dick worked seasonally in Alaska, Minnesota, and Wyoming. In the 1970s and 1980s, he developed a strong foundation in forest management, silviculture, fire and project planning and obtained a Master of Science in Forest Ecology. He worked for 15 years as a Forest Silviculturalist. From 1989 to 1999, Dick served as District Ranger in charge of overall management of the 460,000 acre Plains/Thompson Falls District of the Lolo NF, in Plains, MT. During his tenure at this position,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is natural that such an individual would rise to the top in his agency, and Dick did exactly that. In 1999, the Forest Service brought him here to Washington to serve on the policy analysis staff, and it was at this time that I, too, was able to benefit from his hard work and expertise--directly. When I was first elected to the Senate, Dick came to work for me as a Brookings Institute Fellow for 6 months and I greatly benefited from his expertise and experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He returned to Idaho and was selected to serve as Supervisor of the 2.6 million acre Boise National Forest in 2003. This position entails coordinating forest management and supervisory activities with state agencies, other Federal agencies and the tribes. Then-Governor Dirk Kempthorne appointed him to serve on the board of the Idaho Rural Partnership and the Citizens Advisory Panel to the Policy Analysis Group for the University of Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While under Dick's leadership, the Boise National Forest was one of the first national forests to complete and implement a fuels management project under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. Dick's diligence and commitment to intentional and effective forest management has placed the Boise National Forest at the forefront of implementing hazardous fuels treatment and initiatives that support aquatic restoration, noxious weed mitigation and recreation management. These endeavors are all the more  challenging considering the growing wildland urban interface that characterizes the Boise National Forest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While excelling at his job, Dick maintained his involvement in professional and community organizations. In addition to membership in the American Society of Foresters, Dick has been involved in Boy Scouts, Little League, Jaycees, Lions Club, and various leadership positions with the Rotary Club in the communities in which he has lived over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dick and his wife, Sandy, plan to stay in the Boise area for retirement, enjoying the outdoors hiking, camping, fishing, backpacking and skiing--fitting pursuits for a man who has worked so hard to preserve and manage Idaho's beautiful natural resources for future generations. I appreciate Dick's wisdom and insight over the years; I have depended on his analysis and advice on many forest management issues, and I wish him and Sandy well in the next chapter of their lives.</paragraph>
