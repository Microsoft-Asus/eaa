  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="Introducing S. 2831. A bill to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2831">S. 2831</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Trade Commission Reauthorization Act of 2008. I am joined by Senator Inouye. We seek with this reauthorization to give the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, what it needs to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agency has a very important mission, but needs more resources and authority. The number of FTC employees has been greatly reduced from its pre-1980 high of 1,746, and the agency currently has approximately 1,102 employees. We need to make sure that they have the manpower and the technology to protect consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to take a second to highlight one of the areas where the FTC needs authority most. The subprime loan market was an orgy of greed from a large number of lenders who knowingly put borrowers in mortgage loans that they could not afford--while at the same time loading up these loans with provisions that trigger large fees and penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mortgage brokers ran ads from coast to coast--you have seen them: "Do you have bad credit? Do you have trouble getting a loan? Have you been missing payments on your home loan? Have you filed for bankruptcy? It doesn't matter. Come to us; we will give you a loan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many borrowers were brought in by teaser rates, interest-only payments, no payments for 12 months, etc. Loans had quick resets to higher and unaffordable interest rates. Loans had prepayment penalties. Marketed loan payment amounts did not include escrowed amounts, taxes, insurance, and other financial obligations. These unfair and deceitful advertisements are still on Web sites for lenders across the country today. The FTC needs the authority to stop this practice and resources to investigate  and go after the bad actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you a bit about what the bill does. The bill provides for a 7-year reauthorization starting in 2009. We set the fiscal year 2009 funding at $264 million and increase it by 10 percent per year. In addition, we give them an additional $20 million to be used by the commission to improve technology in support of its competition and consumer protection missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We give the FTC independent litigating authority so they won't have to refer their cases to the Department of Justice. We also give the FTC the authority to give preference in the hiring process to administrative law judges who have experience in their issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We provide the FTC the authority to commence a civil action to recover civil penalties in a district court for any violation of the FTC Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We extend their jurisdiction to allow them to go after nonprofit entities as well, so bad actors cannot hide behind nonprofit status, and we allow them to go after those aiding and abetting an FTC violation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also give them the authority, by majority vote of the full commission, to waive their current rulemaking requirements for any rule involving a consumer protection matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We require the FTC to conduct a rulemaking under the Administrative Procedures Act, APA, which is faster than their current Magnuson-Moss authority, in the area of subprime loans. The commission has sent 200 warning letters to mortgage advertisers and is conducting several investigations of mortgage advertisers and subprime lenders. In addition, the FTC has brought 21 cases in the last decade. But they haven't had the opportunity to review the bad practices and create a rule preventing their  reoccurrence. We give them authority to create a rule preventing unfair or deceptive behavior by lenders and allow the State attorneys general to enforce the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we repeal the common carrier exemption as the FTC has long been requesting. There are too many problems in the telecommunications world that need to be addressed by the FTC--consumers should not be left unprotected. We also make sure that the State Do Not Call laws are not preempted by Federal regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
