    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the giants in Ohio history, Senator Howard Metzenbaum. On March 12, Ohio and our Nation lost a public servant who dedicated 19 years of his life to this institution and to defending and advocating the principles and ideals he held so passionately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though our political views differed, I admired and respected Howard's tenacious work for those things he felt would make a difference for Ohio and our country. One always knew where he stood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been said about how Howard was a self-made man. He epitomized the nose-to-the-grindstone, Midwestern work ethic. As a fellow Clevelander, he grew up poor. But that did not prevent Howard from seizing opportunities as they presented themselves. And he seized those opportunities even as a young boy. Howard graduated from the Ohio State University College of Law, working the entire time to put himself through school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As public servants for Ohio, Howard and I were brought together on many issues and occasions. Many times we did not see eye to eye. However, there were also times when we worked together. While I was Governor of Ohio, then-Senator Metzenbaum, Representative Marcy Kaptur and I worked together in a bipartisan fashion to plant the seed for the Veteran's Glass City Skyway bridge in Toledo, Ohio. Through his leadership, we were able to dedicate the bridge this past summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my colleagues today were here for parts of Howard's 19 years in  the Senate. Those who were here and were on the opposite side of an issue quickly found out what a formidable challenge and powerhouse he could be. Howard did not go along to get along. Howard did what he thought was right and what he thought was in the best interests for the people he represented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was with respect for his service and convictions that Howard was honored in 2005 by renaming the renovated United States Courthouse in Cleveland the Howard M. Metzenbaum Courthouse--a fitting tribute to a man who, when he perceived an injustice, fought so hard to make a wrong right. Howard Metzenbaum made a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Howard will be missed. His family, including his wife Shirley and his four daughters, Shelly, Amy, Susan and Barbara, are in our prayers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, a great son of Ohio, Senator Howard Metzenbaum passed away March 12, in Florida. He was personally inspirational to so many. He changed the lives of Ohioans. He changed the lives of so many Americans through his lifetime commitment to public service. I am honored to hold his seat in the Senate and I am honored to follow in his footsteps. Senate tradition dictates that many Members of the Senate carve their names in the desk drawers of the desks that have been lining  the rows of the Senate. Whoever has Senator Metzenbaum's desk can, with all of us, share in the legacy of his greatness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Metzenbaum and Senator John Glenn, who served together for almost two decades, made an unparalleled team for Ohio. In the Senate, as Senator Reid mentioned, Metzenbaum was a child of poverty. He was a child of prejudice growing up in the east side as a Jew and suffered both from his family's poverty and anti-Semitism, in all too many cases. He worked his way at a job, as a 10-year-old. He worked his way through Ohio State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Senate, Senator Metzenbaum was a master of a constant presence in an often empty Chamber. Once, when a 2-week filibuster was cut off, Metzenbaum was still determined to block action on lifting natural gas price controls. He and a partner sent the Senate into round-the-clock sessions by demanding rollcall votes on 500 amendments. He didn't care if he angered his colleagues. He didn't care if he was liked every day by his colleagues. What he cared about is fighting for economic justice and  social justice for the 10 million citizens whom he represented and for the 250 million Americans or so when he served in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Washington Post, in 1982, the Senator saved $10 million by blocking special interest tax breaks and porkbarrel programs. I remember watching him. I served in the House, the beginning of my House career and the end of his Senate career, and I watched him as a younger elected official in State politics. He stood in front of an audience; the energy just burst from him, and the fiery passion for economic justice and social justice poured forth from him. He would start on the podium,  the first politician I saw do this, and as he worked his way into the speech, he would come from the podium and he would walk into the audience. People would always respond with the same kind of passion and be inspired by him. That is my clearest, favorite memory of him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His legislative record, of course, was so important too. One of the most important things he did was the plant closing legislation, giving a 60-day notice to workers who, too often, have seen their jobs disappear with nothing to show--pensions and more. He fought for people who had less privilege than he did, and he always fought for opportunity for people of both genders. That is what he will be remembered for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly admire his family. Howard was a great family man, a man who cared very much about Shirley, his wife, and four daughters, Shelly, Amy, Susan, and Barbara. He will be greatly missed. He later became head of the Consumer Federation of America, never giving up his passion for fighting for ordinary people and being a warrior for social and economic justice.</paragraph>
