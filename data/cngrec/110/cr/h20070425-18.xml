    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Saturday is Workers Memorial Day, when we mourn the loss of workers who have been killed on the job or from work-related diseases. Additionally, this year marks the 37th anniversary of the enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Although there has been progress, thanks to the tireless advocacy of organized labor, many workers are still at risk. Last year, in Illinois alone, 194 occupational fatalities were recorded. Unfortunately, OSHA, under the Bush  administration, has issued only one major standard in its 6-year tenure, and has either withdrawn or delayed dozens of worker protection measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must ensure the first step of workplace safety by requiring that OSHA issue timely standards and ensure the enforcement of those standards in all areas of the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in this fight, and I encourage all Members of Congress to honor our Nation's workers this Saturday.</paragraph>
