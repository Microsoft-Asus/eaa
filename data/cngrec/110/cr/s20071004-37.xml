  <narrative>LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS -- (Senate - October 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12771">S12771</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to a group of 96 World War II veterans from the Acadiana region of Louisiana that is making their way to Washington this weekend. Here they will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Marine Corps memorials as well as Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The trip to the Nation's Capital this Saturday is being paid for by group in Lafayette, LA, called Louisiana HonorAir. The organization is honoring each surviving Louisiana veteran by giving them a chance to see the memorials dedicated to their service. So far this year, there have been two trips to these Washington memorials and three more are planned, including this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World War II was the deadliest conflict in our history. More than 60 million people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, and more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the long war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Louisiana, there remain today about 44,000 living WWII veterans, and every one of them has their own heroic tale of their experience in achieving a noble victory of freedom over tyranny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mervin Harmon from Lafayette was one of the Tuskegee Airmen, our country's first African American pilots. While serving his country, he had to endure the racism that was prevalent in our society during that era. Mervin, who is 80 now, joined the service at 18, becoming a mechanic and crew chief at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He oversaw the P-51 Mustang fighters the Airmen flew during the war, ensuring that planes were safe for battle. When Mervin trained at Ft. Smith in Arkansas, he remembers  German prisoners of war eating in restaurants while black MPs guarding them were not allowed to be served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mervin and the other Tuskegee airmen helped our country bridge the racial divide. He went on to serve in Lafayette Parish government for 14 years and had an upholstery business in the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in honoring Mervin Harmon, the other 95 Louisiana heroes we welcome to Washington this weekend, and Louisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.</paragraph>
