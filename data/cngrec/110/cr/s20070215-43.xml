    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a veterinarian, I often have animal issues called to my attention by people who--rightly--assume that my background gives me a deeper appreciation of the matter. One such animal issue that goes largely unnoticed is the problem of homeless cats in urban areas. There are an estimated 125,000 such cats in the Denver metro area that never make it to a shelter. These cats, unowned and unsocialized, continue to breed and suffer in feral colonies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to recognize today Spay Day USA, an event designed to manage feral cat colonies through spaying and neutering. On February 26, the Rocky Mountain Alley Cat Alliance is cohosting Spay a Stray Day with the Cat Care Society and the Dumb Friends League. A host of veterinarians and other volunteers hope to spay and neuter 120 cats that day, thus preventing the births of hundreds of unwanted kittens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rocky Mountain Alley Cat Alliance was founded in 1991. They work with volunteers, veterinarians, and citizens to prevent feral and stray kittens from being born on the street and to improve the lives of those already born and abandoned. They are the only local organization that specializes in nonlethal population control and hands on assistance with feral and stray cats. Last year, the alliance spayed or neutered over 2,000 feral and stray cats, preventing an estimated 50,000 homeless kittens  from being born. They treat injuries and illnesses wherever possible and find homes for abandoned cats and kittens. Unmanaged feral cat colonies experience the worst forms of suffering, yet they are the most underserved segment of companion animal overpopulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the alliance's contribution to our society and the good they will do on the 26th with their partners. I wish them continued success.</paragraph>
