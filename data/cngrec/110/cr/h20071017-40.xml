  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman and colleagues, we gather here for an historic moment in the history of transportation, particularly the history of rail transportation. And I'm glad there are so many Members still gathered on the floor to listen to an erudite conversation that we are going to have on both sides of the aisle about the history of rail safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although our committee has had jurisdiction over the rail sector for the past dozen years, this is the first time the committee has brought a rail safety authorization bill to the House floor. It is, in fact, only the second time in 100 years that the House will consider amendments, adjustments to the hours of service rule in the rail sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We bring to you an important bill that addresses long-neglected failings and shortcomings of safety in the rail sector that will make the railroad safer in the future; that will make jobs for workers in that sector safer in the future; that will make safer passage through towns through which railroads pass, often with toxic substances, toxic chemicals, frankly, the safest way to move those substances, but we are going to make it safer with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I particularly want to thank the distinguished Chair of the Subcommittee on Railroads, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown) for her persistent leadership, persistent efforts over the past years of service on the committee in support of rail safety; and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), ranking member of the full committee, participating in substantive discussions that resulted in compromises that we bring to the floor; and to the gentleman from Pennsylvania</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In each of the past five Congresses, I have introduced for consideration by the committee broad scope rail safety legislation and pledged that if it isn't considered in each of those Congresses, when the majority would turn and I would have the opportunity to lead the committee, that we would move such legislation. And today we deliver on that commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The discussions that we had were inclusive. They were extensive. They were intensive. There were adjustments made on both sides with the result that, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart) said during consideration of the rule, this is a bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Railroad Administration has reported that the total number of train accidents, collisions, derailments, and others increased from 2,504 in 1994 over the next decade to 3,325 in 2005. Thankfully, over the last year, that number decreased to 2,925. Those improvements in rail safety statistics are a good sign. But I know from more than 25 years of chairing subcommittees on safety issues that we have a long way to go. Serious accidents resulting in fatalities, injuries, and environmental  damages continue to occur and will continue to occur. Equipment can fail, people make mistakes, storms happen that cause those accidents. But we have to do everything that is possible in our realm to make sure that those accidents are minimized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Safety requires constant vigilance by workers on the job, by employers, by  government safety oversight agencies, and by the Congress. Whether it is in mining, whether in maritime, whether in aviation, trucking, highway passenger vehicle traffic, or in the railways, vigilance is the key to safety. Safety, I define, is the relative absence of risk. And when we apply that standard to every mode of transportation and we enforce it, we will achieve greater  protection of the public interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FRA says that 40 percent of all train accidents result from human factors, and that's a comparable number in the other modes of transportation as well. In railroading, one in four of those accidents results from fatigue. In testimony at our committee hearings, the National Transportation Safety Board said, "The current railroad hours of service laws permit, and many rail carriers require, the most burdensome, fatigue-inducing work schedule of any federally regulated transportation mode in  the country." And a comparison of the modes is revealing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A commercial part 121 airline pilot can work up to 100 hours a month. A part 135, generally known as a charter operation, can work up to 120 hours a month. Shipboard personnel on ocean-going vessels can work up to 360 hours a month. A truck driver can be on duty for 350 hours a month. But in train crews, they can be on duty up to 432 hours a month. That's 14 hours a day for each of those 30 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fatigue sets in. Fatigue causes people to lose concentration, to lose focus, to lose control. Vince Lombardi said, "Fatigue makes cowards of us all." He didn't mean physical cowards. He meant inability to make the right judgments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And that's what fatigue does in the workplace. If you have any question about it, look at some of the things we say around this body at 2, 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning after 14 or 16 hours of debate. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you listen to it or when you read it. And it doesn't make any better sentence in the locomotive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress made some slight modifications to the hours of service law in 1969, but this bill is the first major reform of rail hours of service standards since 1907. Our duty is to make hours of service safer and better. And this bill provides signal and train crews with rest, prohibits them from working more than 12 hours in a day, limits limbo time. I said in the beginning of the hearing, if it was good enough for the Pope to eliminate limbo, it ought to be good enough for the Congress to at  least limit it in rail service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also requires all class 1 railroads to implement a positive train control system, which was the NTSB's most wanted transportation safety improvement since this was developed in 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also addresses track safety. In 2006, track-related accidents surpassed human factors as the leading cause of all train accidents. Just look at the list. Most recently, in Oneida, New York; Pico Rivera in California; Home Valley in Washington; Minot, North Dakota; Nodaway, Iowa. All of them raise serious questions about the condition and the safety of the track on the Nation's railways, call into question the adequacy of track safety regulation and FRA's, Federal Railroad Association's,  oversight of those conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill requires the railroads to inspect their tracks, to look for internal defects, and provides increased funding for Federal Railroad Administration for track inspection technology, and strengthens enforcement at the Federal Railroad Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FRA investigated just 13 percent of the most serious grade crossing collisions. We've got to do better than that. In 2004, the FAA conducted onsite investigations of 1,392, 93 percent of the aviation accidents that FAA had responsibility for investigating, but the FRA did only 13 percent. That's not good enough. That's not conducting oversight. That's not accepting and exercising your governmental oversight responsibility and responsibility to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We increase the number of inspectors for safety at the FRA. We will double the number of Federal rail safety inspectors over the next 4 years. And we do many other items that are of great importance. I will include in the Record at this point the committee document that lists in specific detail all those safety improvements.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="409888" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are here today to consider one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will undertake this year, as the chairman pointed out, the Federal Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman pointed out, there are still accidents that occur and there are still deaths that occur on rail, but to put that into perspective, in 2006, it was in fact the safest year ever in our Nation's railroad history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 30 years, we have made tremendous progress in reducing the number of train accidents and deaths that occur around our rail yards and railroad lines. Let me give you some of those statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, there were 33 railroad employees that were killed; in 2006, it's down to 16. Now, that's 16 too many, and we can continue to reduce that as we're attempting to do in this bill, but as you can see, there has been definite improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passenger trains, which were carrying, in 1996, 397 million people, in that year, there were 12 passengers killed. In 2006, there were 549 million passengers that were transported by train, and there were only two killed in 2006. Once again, a significant decrease. Any death is too many, but we're seeing positive results in the rail industry. In 1996, 488 people were killed at grade crossing accidents; and in 2006, that number, again, is down to 369.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While those numbers are high, this bill is going to address, as I will talk about here, how it's going to address those unsafe conditions and how we can improve making them safer for the traveling public and, of course, the rail industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the biggest issues we address in this bill is limbo time, the time that train crews must wait for pickup at the end of a run. Limbo time is very complicated. We went through some complicated negotiations, but in the end, limbo time will still exist. And I think it's important that people know that the limbo time that employees wait at the end of their run, they are being paid for limbo time, but it extends that waiting period and can result in crews being fatigued. So we phased that down  in this bill. We phased down limbo time to 10 hours per month over a period of 3 years. Complete elimination of limbo time would have had some unintended consequences, like forcing train crew members to relocate their homes to new reporting points. The compromised language in this bill avoids disrupting the lives of rail workers and should permit railroad operations to continue smoothly and safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another safety concern addressed in this bill is installation of positive train control, or PTC. The bill mandates that PTC be installed by the year 2014, but also provides up to 2 years of leeway in case a better or more effective system is developed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Installation of PTC will likely cost about $3 billion, but the people that use the system will pay for that. That's not going to be passed on to the taxpayers, but the people that use the system and the rail industry will see some positive things happening in their operations to help them lower their costs. That's why I think it's important that we install an effective and reliable system, and this bill will ensure that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must admit that I think the bill still has some weaknesses, and we need to continue to improve in some critical areas. Grade crossing and trespassing fatalities, still the numbers are high. As I mentioned earlier, in 1996, there were 471 fatalities. That number went up, trespassers that died in 2006, to 517. And trespassers are people that are going onto rail properties illegally, they don't belong there, but those trespassing deaths are something we have to address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grade crossing fatalities. Again, we've seen them decrease, but we need to do more. I am grateful to Mr. Graves, who submitted an important amendment in the committee markup. The amendment is now part of the bill and authorizes up to $250,000 in emergency funding for a crossing which experiences a collision with a school bus or an accident where there is a fatality. Presently, if there is a fatality, that grade crossing just stays on the list, but with Mr. Graves' amendment,  we're going to push it up until it's prioritized and make sure that crossing is dealt with in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also grateful to Mr. Brown from South Carolina, who helped us create a provision fostering the use of advanced warning devices at railroad crossings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Brown, the subcommittee Chair, for working with me and Mr. Mica in trying to make this bill a better bill. As I said, there are still some improvements that we would like to see, and we will continue to work through the process to make the bill a stronger bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Chair of our Rail Subcommittee, Ms. Brown, the gentlelady from Florida.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>First of all, let me just thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on Transportation. Truly, Mr. Oberstar is a transportation guru. And his motto, "Transportation is the committee that put America to work," I want to thank you for "let's put America to work safely." I also want to thank Mr. Mica and Mr. Shuster for their hard work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Developing this rail safety legislation was the number one priority for the Railroad Subcommittee. Congress last passed legislation to reauthorize the Federal Railroad Administration in 1994. That authorization expired in 1998. Since that time, the railroad industry has changed greatly. Economic growth and increase in international trade has led to record traffic levels. At the same time, Amtrak and the commuter railroads, which often operate freight rail lines, are moving more passengers, which  means that there's lots of pressure on the rail system, and this has a major impact on work and public safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning of the 110th Congress, the subcommittee has held six hearings on rail safety, examined fatigue, the role of human factors in rail accidents, and the reauthorization of the Federal Rail Safety program. We also held two hearings in Texas and California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the subcommittee's hearings, we met with labor, the railroads, government agencies, and other interested parties in crafting this legislation. Through some tough negotiations, we were able to develop a bipartisan agreement on the most difficult issues, and I believe we have a really good bill. Let me highlight a number of provisions in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill> reauthorized the FRA as the Federal Railroad Safety Administration and ensures that it will consider and assign maintenance and safety as their highest priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill seeks to help prevent accidents caused by human factors, which accounts for about 40 percent of all rail accidents, by strengthening the hours  of service law, increasing worker training and qualifications, and implementing advanced safety technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill improves safety at our Nation's grade crossings. It requires railroads to establish, maintain, and post a toll-free number at all grade crossings to receive calls regarding malfunctions of signals, crossing gates, or disabled vehicles blocking crossings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill> directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations regarding railroads to remove all overgrown vegetation from their right-of-way to improve the view of pedestrians and motor vehicle operators. <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill> also requires railroads to develop and submit to the Secretary a plan for implementing a positive train control system by December 31, 2014.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, it requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a long-term strategy for improving railroad safety, which must include a plan and schedule for reducing the number and rates of accidents, injuries and fatalities involving railroads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, this legislation is going to save lives. I look forward to going to conference and putting a bill on the President's desk for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on the committee. And I would encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="409888" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>I yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished ranking member of the Transportation Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Shuster, for yielding me time, and also for managing the time today on this bill. Mr. Shuster is doing an outstanding job in leading the Republican side of the Rail Subcommittee, and I appreciate his fine efforts. Also, the great efforts of my colleague from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown), who chairs the subcommittee. And indeed, we are fortunate to have someone with Mr. Oberstar's leadership at our helm, chairing the committee after a  long wait of some 32 years. I know this has been one of his priorities, rail safety, and I'm pleased that he has an opportunity to bring his bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, of course, ladies and gentlemen of the House, my colleagues, we all want safe rail, we want safe infrastructure in our Nation, and it is important that we do everything possible to move safety forward and to make certain that freight rail, passenger rail, that our crossings, that those that work and are employed in this great industry are as safe as possible. And I think that that was the original intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me say that I have an agreement with Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown and Mr. Shuster to support this bill on passage, and I intend to put my card in the reader and I will vote "yes." That doesn't prohibit me from talking a little bit about the bill and the genesis of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now, the intent is one thing about this legislation, and I think, again, it was safety and well-intended. But unfortunately, I think we started out with a bad bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other side won the election, and there were some presents to be presented to labor. This doesn't have a red bow on it. But this started out as something I think that was sort of a gift to labor from the election. It is nice to approach legislation from that standpoint. But I think we have been able to take what I consider a very bad bill, that its intention was to actually codify some of the labor work rules relating to our rail industry. We have taken that bad legislation, and we have made  it a little bit better. I think we still have a ways to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some good things in this. Mr. Oberstar pointed out that we did take the number one recommendation of the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board. That is the board that does investigate accidents. It is important that we take from them the best information they have possible and then translate that into legislative action so that accident doesn't occur. So, one, we have taken their recommendation, a positive train separation, and it is part of this bill. I am complimentary  of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Mr. Graves, the gentleman from Missouri, a member of our committee and outstanding subcommittee Chair, I am sorry, ranking member, of the Public Buildings Subcommittee, his crossing prioritization for changing out dangerous crossings is an excellent provision. I think also that there is a good provision in this for acquiring some of the technical equipment. You have to understand, Mr. Shuster said there are very few accidents. In fact, the latest statistics that we have,  there were 16 employee deaths in 2006. Only six of the deaths involved train accidents. So it is a very low number. That is compared to 25 of 33 employee deaths in 1996. So there is substantial improvement in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if you look at some of the factors, and we have the factors that cause train accidents, you find the human factor is number one. It accounts for some 35, almost 36 percent of train accidents. This bill doesn't do enough, really, to deal with the human factors, in my opinion. Some of that involves training and some other things that we should be addressing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second is track defects. I had a chance, when I was going to college, I worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week on the rail to finance my college education, part of it, and I got to see some of what happens on the railroads firsthand. Track defects today are very difficult to detect just by some of the measures that we have, for example, in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill mandates that we have almost a doubling of track inspectors. Now, that is a nice gift also to the unions. We will get a few more union members. But is that what we need when the way to really detect track defects is with the latest technology and equipment? I did say the bill has authorization for acquisition of, I think, six additional track testing pieces of equipment. But if we really want to do that, we should be spending not just more money on bodies and inspectors and routine  inspections, increasing those, kind of makework; we should be, first of all, making certain that we have a risk-based inspection system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I become chairman of Aviation, that was one of the things we did in Aviation, and I gave my blessings to, back in 1991. We have enjoyed the safest period of aviation safety, passenger aircraft safety, in the history of our Nation. I believe that is because it is a risk-based system. Rather than going out on a Monday, we are going to inspect this piece of equipment and then we schedule that for the next month on Monday and we go back and we do it and we add inspectors, we look at where the  risks are and that is where we put our resources. It is not always how much we spend; it is how we spend it and how we apply those dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I have some questions about the approach in this bill. We do have an agreement. I am pleased to support this. My hope is that we can take this bill as we have done working with Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Mr. Shuster, and we can craft it into a better piece of legislation as it goes hopefully through conference, and I will support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, there are some questions about the amendments. I will support the manager's amendment which I agreed to. The other three Members have asked me, and I say, you pick and choose. Mr. Oberstar and I did not make the decision on the three other amendments the Rules Committee brought forth, and you will have to assess them as to their own merits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we take this legislation up. It is important that we move together in a bipartisan fashion. I have a little bit different set of priorities, again, on some of the issues that we have addressed in the legislation. But I have a fond hope that through a bipartisan future effort we can approve this legislation and continue to make certain that our rail employees, our rail passengers and those that cross the railroad tracks in our communities are safe.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his comments, for his support of the bill. I am delighted to learn that the gentleman spent so much time on the railroad going through college. We share that. I worked on the rail during my years in the iron ore mines. I worked those double-aught shifts, as well, and I know how hard hours of service are and how important it is for us to put those limits on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Salazar).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400620" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Minnesota, and I thank  you for your leadership on this very important bill, and Chairwoman Brown, as well, for your exceptional leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007, and urge swift passage of the measure. I believe that this bill addresses many important issues that have been ignored for far too long. I am grateful to the chairwoman, as well, for the inclusion of the language that authorizes funding for the tunnel to be built at the Transportation Technology Center, an internationally recognized train testing facility that she was able to tour last year.  It is located in Pueblo, Colorado. TTC is used by the Federal Railroad Administration to conduct significant research and development on rail safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TTC offers 48 miles of railroad track to test rolling stock, track components, signal and safety devices, track structure and vehicle performance. It also has several one-of-a-kind laboratory test facilities used for evaluating vehicle dynamics, structural characteristics and advanced braking systems. TTC already operates as a world-class research and test center offering a wide range of capabilities in railroad and transit research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 2 years, we have been working to get funding for a facility for an underground rail station and tunnel at TTC. The tunnel will add to the center's capabilities and serve as an invaluable resource as we strive to ensure that our Nation's railroads are safe and secure against possible terror attacks. Recent events have sadly demonstrated the vulnerability of underground mass transit systems. Safety experts have identified a number of technology and training needs to prevent attacks  on tunnels and lessen the consequences of such attacks. These needs include detection systems, dispersal control and decontamination techniques.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinctive, remote environment of TTC allows such testing and training activities to be carried out at a secure location, without disruption to the flow of passenger and rail traffic in and around urban areas. I applaud Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown and Mr. Shuster for recognizing the important role that such a tunnel will play in rail safety. I believe <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill> ensures that we remain the world's safest rail system, and I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400012" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member for yielding his time. I certainly appreciate the good work he has done with Ranking Member Mica on this important rail safety bill. Of course, Chairwoman Brown and Chairman Oberstar have been exemplary in working in a bipartisan way to bring this product to the House floor today, and I certainly hope all Members will find a way to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak to only one element of the bill that I had particular interest in, and that is with regard to a new reporting requirement for the rails to disclose on an annual basis to the Surface Transportation Board the amount of money spent out of their capital for improvements to rail, track, locomotives and other related maintenance which will give us, I believe for the first time, critical metrics to analyze what they are doing to preserve the safety of our rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, safety is uppermost in our mind today, but our rail system is also the heart of our economy. The ability to move goods and services and people across this great Nation over our rail system is absolutely essential going forward. We must judge based on their actual expenditure whether the rails themselves are engaging in appropriate conduct in spending the necessary funds to make this system safe and sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have great concerns that in periods of record profitability, Wall Street analysts have identified these systems as being very undervalued. In fact, there are indications that some hedge fund managers are acquiring large blocks of railroad stock and the consequential reaction has been by the rails to repurchase their own stock and perhaps divert needed resources from necessary and very important infrastructure improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the committee leadership for the inclusion of this important provision, as I think going forward it will enable this Congress to take actions that are necessary and proper to preserve this important system.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>. I congratulate all my colleagues for this strong bipartisan railroad safety bill, and I associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman who just spoke.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is of utmost importance to my district because over 160 trains travel through my district daily carrying over 14,000 containers, many containing hazardous material, carrying $400 billion worth of trade, most of it for the eastern part of the United States. It is expected to triple by the year 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have experienced many derailments in my area. That has caused great distress not only to my families, to the businesses, the damage, the economic impact it has had, the threat to the public safety, and the anxiety caused along that railroad corridor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Railroad Safety Improvement Act helps prevent future derailments by improving track safety, improving grade crossing safety, improving whistleblower protections, addressing concerns over railroad fatigue, and ensures enforcement by clarifying the U.S. Attorney General's authority to bring civil action against the railroads, increasing penalties, increasing reporting of enforcement actions, and many other areas that are very, very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes two of my amendments to section 605, creating strict training standards for railroad inspectors, tough training for all rail employees who expressed to us their lack of training curriculum and additional training requirements for railroad inspectors who have expressed that they need that training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment creates strong training, testing and skills evaluation measures, ensures that the train inspectors are able to address critical safety defects that contribute to derailments and accidents in a timely basis. I couldn't agree more with the gentleman. We need to look at new technology that is going to help us get there. But we also need the support of the railroads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My second amendment in section 407 authorizes $1.5 million for operation life safety for a total of $6 million. I certainly want to show that we all cooperate in this and look forward to having this vote pass with great success.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007. A number of the speakers who will speak on this bill today, when the bill was first introduced I had some difficulty with some of the provisions, but I want to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Member Mica and Ranking Member Shuster for continuing the great hallmark of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and working through those  issues, be it limbo time, be it Federal preemption, be it a variety of other issues, and reaching a product that was brought to the floor today that I think that most, if not all of us, will be supportive of, as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Just a moment about Chairman Oberstar. When the majority changed, there's more Democrats on the committee than there are Republicans. They could write their own bill. But that hasn't been the way this committee has ever worked, and that isn't the way Chairman Oberstar is running the committee either. He reached out  to our side of the aisle to talk about these issues, and the result is that he has brought to the floor a piece of legislation  that will overwhelmingly pass sometime later this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this important legislation will bring industry and government a long way towards the shared goal of improving rail safety. Although the number of train accidents decreased last year by almost 500, it is unclear whether that 1-year progress will continue. We are and we should always be looking for new ways to improve safety, not only for railroad employees, but for the surrounding communities as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite everyone's best intentions, disasters will strike. As the current Speaker pro tempore is well aware, in January of 2002, a Canadian Pacific train derailed 31 of its 112 cars in Minot, North Dakota. Five tank cars carrying anhydrous ammonia, a liquefied compressed gas, catastrophically ruptured, and a toxic vapor plume covered the derailment site and surrounding area. More than 11,000 people were impacted, and there was one fatality. More than 300 people were injured, including two members  of the crew. Damages in that event exceeded $2 million, and more than $8 million has been spent for environmental cleanup efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, just last week in Painesville, Ohio, about a mile from my district office, a CSX train derailed 30 of its 112 cars. A car containing ethanol exploded and fire engulfed several cars containing grain and ethanol. It burned for a number of days. More than 1,000 residents were evacuated, schools were disrupted, and roads, highways and businesses closed. Fortunately, in our event there were no injuries, but it was a tremendous disruption in the lives of many people. The six law enforcement  agencies and 24 local fire departments that responded put in an untold number of overtime hours. Officials are only now evaluating the environmental fallout as they search for a cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To its credit, CSX Rail has stepped up following this incident. They are paying for hotel rooms of displaced persons, assisting in a variety of manners with the recovery and cleanup efforts, and have shown that they are willing to take responsibility when something goes awry. Our local responders and CSX worked together and provided a seamless response in Painesville.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am also happy to announce that following my conversation last Friday with Tony Ingram, the chief operating officer of CSX, the company has offered to work to cover the costs incurred by our local first responders. I greatly appreciate that and know that this is going to be a huge relief to cash-strapped communities in my district whose budget cannot handle the overtime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While CSX is doing its best to minimize the damage this derailment has caused, it goes to show that when accidents do happen, this disruption is enormous. We must do everything that we can to prevent these types of incidents from occurring. The bill that Mr. Oberstar has brought forward today before the Congress takes a number of steps in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding and for all his tireless efforts on behalf of rail safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act. As the chairman says, I represent part of Chicago, which is the rail hub of the Nation. I understand just how important railroad traffic is, railroads are to this country, both passenger and freight. In all transportation, safety is key.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes crucial improvements in safety for rail employees, passengers and all Americans who live, work, travel along rail lines. I would like to commend Chairman Oberstar, Subcommittee Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Member Shuster, and Ranking Member Mica for their work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, among the other important improvements that come in this bill, <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill> works to strengthen the integrity of our Nation's rail system, encourages the implementation of new technologies, such as positive train control systems, known as PTC. I am especially pleased that, at my request, the committee included language in the bill that provides Federal funding to expedite PTC installation. PTC systems can drastically reduce collisions, derailments and other accidents, while at the  same time improving efficiency. It's clearly a much-needed advance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to speak right now in strong support of the Napolitano amendment, which broadly ensures Mexican trains entering the U.S. continue to receive proper brake, mechanical and hazardous material inspections by highly skilled American personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this bill is essential for continued safety of our railways. I urge adoption of the Napolitano amendment and passage of the underlying bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman, not only for yielding, but his extraordinarily hard work in preparing this bill, along with my good friend, the gentlewoman from Florida, who together have crafted a bill, working with Mr. Mica and Mr. Shuster, so that what we have before us is a classic bipartisan bill and one that is urgently needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a public transportation bill, and it looks to a part of our economy upon which we are disproportionately dependent. It also happens to be a mode of transportation that is relatively clean. I got to thinking about the importance of this bill, Mr. Chairman, and I could only think about where we have spent much more time, and that is on air travel. Yet, we have limited the time that pilots, and, for that matter, other air personnel can be on duty and certainly in the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rail employees for decades have simply absorbed the burden of extraordinary numbers of hours away from home, on duty. How have we escaped some catastrophic accidents that would linger in our minds? I think it is only because of the courage and the perseverance of rail personnel, who obviously have worked through fatigue and who have simply taken on their shoulders most of the hardships. I don't even want to think about what the cost of family life has been with regards to children, the cost of  being away when there has been an emergency or death in the family or someone is lingering. I just don't want to think about that, because when I do, I am reminded about how late this bill is and how urgent it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the chairman, and I want to commend the courage of rail workers, and especially I want to do so as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which is deeply affected as well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Chairwoman Brown and Ranking Member Shuster for their work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district is located in a densely populated area on Long Island, New York. We have the comfort and convenience of rail transportation to New York City by the Long Island Railroad. The Long Island Railroad moves safely through the Fourth Congressional District with the use of locomotive horns at train crossings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the use of horns at train crossings ensures the safety of the surrounding communities, horn noise also has a substantial impact on the quality of life of individuals living in those communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in Cedarhurst, New York, there are five train crossings  within a half mile. Because the crossings are so close together, the result is a continuous horn blast as the train moves through the community. The horn noise can be so loud and last so long that individuals must stop any ongoing conversations for several minutes. This happens most often during rush hour, but continues approximately 50 times throughout the day. Individuals find it  difficult to sleep through the horn noise, even with the use of earplugs, and are awakened early in the morning and late in the evening. Also, because my district is so densely populated, the horn noise bounces off many of the buildings nearest the railroad and seems to intensify as it moves through the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the Federal Railroad Administration and its primary goal of ensuring the safety of railroads and trains across the country and in the Fourth Congressional District of New York. I do not and will not support any measure that will reduce the safety of railroads and trains coming through my community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that in mind, I also understand the effect of locomotive noise that does interfere with the quality of life. I have received countless letters and e-mails from my constituents expressing how noise affects their daily lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to the impact that locomotive horn noise has on the communities in my district, I support the language in the manager's amendment that allows the Secretary to consider the impact of horn noise on the local community and the unique characteristics of the community that it is serving in considering applications for waivers or exemptions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for working with me on this issue and allowing me the time to express my support for his amendment and the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="OTHER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me take this opportunity first of all to rise and indicate that I am here on behalf of the Napolitano amendment. The amendment would prohibit Mexican companies and inspectors from performing mechanical inspections of trains unless they meet specific U.S. standards, including rigorous training of inspectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is essential. We have some 10,000 trains that cross the U.S.-Mexican border through my district alone. We had over four derailments in 2004. We think this is an amendment that is important and is critical in order for us to continue to have safety in those trains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to encourage the passage of the amendment by Congresswoman Grace Napolitano that will allow an opportunity for those inspectors to be well trained and to make sure that they specify U.S. standards before that occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated earlier, I represent the longest stretch of the Mexican border of any Member of Congress, and I think that this is an area of significance and importance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, through this process, we have had some significant differences, but we were able to work them out and produce a product that has bipartisan support in the committee. For me, it was a great experience working with Chairwoman Brown, but especially working with Chairman Oberstar. At times it was quite daunting to go into negotiations with somebody who not only knows the current issues of the rail history, but knows the vast history of the rail industry. So I made  it through the process and learned quite a bit, and I appreciate the chairman and chairwoman for working with me, and also, of course, Mr. Mica for giving me the responsibility on this piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I again want to express my great appreciation to Ms. Brown for years of advocacy for rail issues and for her championing of the rail safety matters, and to thank the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, who has devoted a great deal of energy and time and effort to rail from his first day on the committee, asking the committee to hold a hearing in 2001 in his district on rail maintenance yard issues and continuation of rail service. It turned out to be a very enlightening  hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has remained engaged in the issues. As the gentleman said a moment ago, we did not just throw issues on the table; we rather sat around the table after the hearings and discussed in detail repeatedly subject matters, made concessions on each side, adjustments, understanding each other's concerns, and reached not the ideal of each side, but ideal in the best public interest. The result is, I believe, a bill that substantially advances the cause of rail safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I must say in passing that it diminishes the substance of the bill to say that it is, as the previous speaker did, a gift to rail labor. This is a gift to all Americans, to all residents of communities that are home to railroads, to rail makeup yards through which the goods of America move, through which the coal and the grain and the containers move. It is safety for them. It is safety for the workers on the railroads. It is in the best interest of all America. I urge passage of the bill.</paragraph>

  <chair> (a) Amendment.--Chapter 201 of title 49, United States Code, as amended by this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following: "&#xA7;20165. Fostering introduction of new technology to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings</chair>
  <chair> "(a) Findings.--(1) Collisions between highway users and trains at highway-rail grade crossings continue to cause an unacceptable loss of life and serious personal injury and also threaten the safety of rail transportation.</chair>
  <chair> "(2) While elimination of at-grade crossings through consolidation of crossings and grade separations offers the greatest long-term promise for optimizing the safety and efficiency of the two modes of transportation, over 140,000 public grade crossings remain on the general rail system--approximately one for each route mile on the general rail system.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(3) Conventional highway traffic control devices such as flashing lights and gates are effective in warning motorists of a train's approach to an equipped crossing.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(4) Since enactment of the Highway Safety Act of 1973, over $4,200,000,000 of Federal funding has been invested in safety improvements at highway-rail grade crossings, yet a majority of public highway-rail grade crossings are not yet equipped with active warning systems.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(5) The emergence of new technologies supporting Intelligent Transportation Systems presents opportunities for more effective and affordable warnings and safer passage of highway users and trains at remaining highway-rail grade crossings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(6) Implementation of new crossing safety technology will require extensive cooperation between highway authorities and railroad carriers.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(7) Federal Railroad Safety Administration regulations establishing performance standards for processor-based signal and train control systems provide a suitable framework for qualification of new or novel technology at highway-rail grade crossings, and the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides an appropriate means of determining highway user interface with such new technology.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to encourage the development of new technology that can prevent loss of life and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary of Transportation is designated to carry out this policy in consultation with States and necessary public and private entities.".</chair>

It startled my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation and our colleagues on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But shortly after that, the Federal Railroad Administration and the GAO warned that many of the Nation's 76,000 railroad bridges may also be at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FRA on September 11 issued a rail safety advisory on railroad bridges, reporting that 52 accidents over the period 1982 to 1986 were caused by the catastrophic structural failure of railroad bridges. The most recent accident was the M&amp;B Railroad near Myrtlewood, Alabama, where a train of solid-fuel rocket motors derailed when a timber trestle railroad bridge collapsed under that train. Several cars, one carrying a rocket motor, rolled onto their side. Six people were injured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bridge failures do not account for the majority of train accidents, but FRA noted and updated their guidelines and reported that they have found instances "where lack of adherence to the FRA's bridge safety policy resulted in trains operating over structural deficiencies in steel bridges that could easily have resulted in serious train accidents." We deal with that issue, among others, in this manager's amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, Chairman Oberstar's manager's amendment contains several important provisions. First, it codifies FRA's existing safety advisory on railroad bridges. This provision will help ensure that the recent tragic collapse of the highway bridge in Minneapolis will never be repeated on our Nation's rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manager's amendment also modifies the Swift Act, which requires locomotives to sound whistles at every crossing in the Nation. The amendment will require the FRA to take into account the impact of horn use on local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the town of Baldwin, Florida, is only a mile wide, but has a number of rail crossings and heavy train traffic. According to Mayor Godbold of Baldwin, locomotives sound their horns over a thousand times per day in this small town. The amendment will help Baldwin and other towns balance issues of safety and noise pollution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the manager's amendment makes some technical corrections deleting the preemption and the police provisions which have already been enacted in the 9/11 bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member and Mr. Shuster for doing such a wonderful job on this bill. The chairman is passionate about this issue, and the American people are fortunate to have people in the Chair's position who are knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>, and am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation which would reorganize the Federal Railroad Administration as the Federal Railroad Safety Administration, and requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a long-term strategy for reducing the number and rates of accidents, injuries, and fatalities involving railroads. It is not just linguistics; it is action and direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Memphis, which lies along the Tennessee border, is a major hub for the railroad industry. The city ranks third nationally in the number of class 1 railroads. According to the Memphis Regional Chamber, 220 trains pass through Memphis every day. Between January and July of 2007, there were 36 rail accidents in Shelby County, two of which were fatal. Consequently, railroad safety is critically important to my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was pleased that this Congress passed and enacted <bill type="h" number="1401">H.R. 1401</bill>, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act, which was designed to enhance the security of our railroad transportation systems. The bill also adopted an amendment I introduced which called on the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Homeland Security Secretary, to work to minimize the hazards of toxic inhalation hazardous material.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation today goes further by focusing on rail safety for passengers, pedestrians and train workers. The bill changes the hours of service rules for railroad workers and includes measures to improve areas where railroad tracks cross roads. This happens  too frequently in Memphis, particularly in the university district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to inspection personnel shortages, the measure requires the Department of Transportation increase the number of Federal Railroad Safety Administration safety inspections and enforcement personnel, setting targets that are reachable and good for the public. I urge all Members to support passage of the bill.</paragraph>

And I note those two because they are two of the five objections the administration raises in its statement of administration policy, so they are objecting to two items not in the bill nor in the manager's amendment. Therefore, I urge support of the  manager's amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment ensures that trains entering or reentering this country from Mexico are certified and inspected. Over 10,000 trains enter the United States from Mexico through Calexico, San Ysidro, Brownsville, El Paso, Laredo, Eagle Pass and Arizona at Nogales. Currently, all trains crossing the border are inspected by our own U.S. inspectors who are highly trained, must follow stringent FRA requirements, fully understand rail safety laws, earn a good salary with  strong benefits, and the rail companies they work for are fully liable in case of an accident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. railroad companies have been trying to outsource inspections to Mexico. Union Pacific has been twice denied by FRA in 2004 and 2007. We must set up a process for the Department of Transportation to ensure continued protection with legitimate inspections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mexican inspectors have much lower standards for safety than our U.S. inspectors, are not versed in U.S. laws and regulations, and are poorly compensated compared to U.S. inspectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment ensures that all trains coming into the United States from Mexico continue to be safe for rail travel in our country and prohibits Mexican inspectors from performing safety inspections unless the U.S. Secretary of Transportation certifies that inspections are performed under U.S. regulation and U.S. standards, that the Mexican Government is effectively enforcing such safety standards, that inspectors are receiving comparable classroom and on-the-job training as in the U.S., inspection  records are maintained in both English and Spanish, records are available to the FRA for review, and the FRA is permitted to perform on-site inspections in Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment also forbids inspections of any hazardous material railcars from taking place in Mexico. FRA must have the ability to grant waivers only if strict safety precautions are in place and adhered to. My amendment protects against future attempts by railroads to apply for inspections in Mexico unless they follow restrictions. My amendment ensures safety and security of all trains entering the United States through the southern border.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="409888" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have some concerns with this amendment which attempts to regulate railcar brake inspections in Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I understand it, this issue has already been dealt with by the FRA. The Union Pacific Railroad had requested a limited waiver to do certain air brake testing in Mexico, but the Federal Rail Administration denied that waiver. So air brake and other safety inspections are actually being done on the American side of the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A potentially larger issue is that this amendment attempts to regulate labor conditions in Mexico. This amendment would interfere with the existing flow of commerce across our southern border. I do not have an answer to that, but I am concerned it could be construed as violating NAFTA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I agree with Mrs. Napolitano's intent of ensuring a safe U.S. rail system, I have great concerns. But I hope we can work together as we go through conference to take care of my concerns. I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2  minutes to point out that although the gentleman is right, the FRA did deny Union Pacific, the denial is "without prejudice to the submission of a future request addressing the same subject matter," so the issue remains alive and it seems appropriate to address it in this manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman does raise a concern about the NAFTA agreement and such language might run in contravention, but safety always trumps other issues. In our aviation trade agreements with other countries, the U.S. rules on safety prevail over those of the trading nation. We are elevating this whole role of safety in the FRA and changing its title to the Federal Railroad Safety Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we should explore further in that context and with relationship to aviation the effect of NAFTA and the effect this language might have within NAFTA, and I will be glad to pursue that with the gentleman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This amendment is about protecting American jobs, and I state, about protecting American jobs. It's about ensuring the safety of our workers and our communities. It's about securing our Nation's borders. We must not let the railroad industry outsource this important work. The safety and security of our Nation depends on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten thousand trains enter the United States from Mexico each year. We must ensure the highest standards for safety inspections of these trains. American workers know how to do it best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment ensures the highest safety, training and enforcement standards are met. In the wake of 9/11 and in light of the train derailments we've seen, and I know that in my district we had one, it is the least we can do to enhance the safety of our community and ensure our Nation's safety.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'm glad that the chairman of the committee pointed out that this is an ongoing issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, 2007, when it was requested, it may have been denied, but in San Antonio, we've had such a rash of accidents for the past 5 years that finally railroad safety came to the forefront and we are recognizing some progress. Let's not go backward and allow these waivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the FRA denied the UP waiver in 2004, it did so because they found that documentation on employee training was insufficient and unsatisfactory. When they withdrew their request in 2007, the company spokesman commented that the political climate was wrong for them to push for the waiver.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment will exclude solid waste rail transfer facilities from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board and provide that laws outlining the STB's jurisdiction would not preempt the authority of State and local governments to regulate such facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In New Jersey, and all over the country, certain waste handlers and railroad companies have tried to exploit a supposed loophole in Federal law in order to set up unregulated waste transfer facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, the STB has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers and the ability to grant Federal preemption over other laws at any level, local, State or Federal, that might impede such transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Congress intended such authority to extend only transportation by rail, not to the operation of facilities that are merely sited next to rail operations or have a business connection to a rail company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, certain companies have exploited this loophole to build or plan waste transfer stations next to rail lines and avoid any regulation from the State or local authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's my hope that this amendment will take the STB out of the waste management business by ensuring that State and local governments have the right to regulate solid waste transfer stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must ensure that solid waste facilities follow the rules and do not pollute pristine open space, and do all that we can to protect our environment from unregulated facilities.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="409888" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with STB preemption of laws regarding railroad waste transportation facilities. The Rail Subcommittee has held several hearings on this issue, one last year and another just yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've a great interest in this issue, as my home State of Pennsylvania is the number one recipient of imported waste from other States, most of it coming from New Jersey and New York City. So, as I said, I've great concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At yesterday's hearing, we heard many complaints from local communities about illegal railroad, or not  even railroads, but people who claim the railroads, that are waste facilities. We also heard from the STB that most local laws are not currently preempted by Federal law. In fact, many entities claiming Federal preemption do not have legitimate claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's clear that this law has to be clarified to make it easier to stop unscrupulous operators that Mr. Pallone mentioned in his State of New Jersey, but regarding Mr. Pallone's amendment, the STB has told our rail staff that this amendment needs improvement to accomplish that, to accomplish the stated goal of regulating railroad waste facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, I quote from a letter from the chairman of STB that says his "general concern with the Pallone amendment is that it is overbroad and could result in local land use and zoning agencies exerting jurisdiction over legitimate rail transportation projects and impeding interstate commerce."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the STB is already in the process of addressing many of these issues, which they need to do. If people were out there operating waste facilities in an illegal or unscrupulous manner, that needs to be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to work with Mr. Pallone on this issue, but I'm going to oppose this amendment on those grounds. We need to encourage States to deal with their trash problem, all of us across this country. We all produce waste. We've got to make sure in our neighborhoods that we're taking care of our own waste and not shipping it to other States, and I'm just concerned that that's what will occur if this amendment is passed. And so I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment Congressman Pallone for his hard work on this issue of rail-owned waste transfer facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Railroad Subcommittee held a hearing on rail-owned municipal waste transfer facilities. We learned that there is a growing concern in the Northeast that some railroads are using Federal preemptions standards to shield themselves from important State and local environmental laws which are leading to a lack of environmental and health-related oversight of these facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This language may need to be refined to ensure that States and localities don't overregulate the industry, but this is the right first step in ensuring that railroad operated waste transfer stations are not posing a health or environmental risk to the communities where they're operating.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the essential issue here is not whether the noxious fumes, whether the groundwater pollution caused by solid waste deposited on rail property should be regulated. The question here is whether the language and the manner in which the gentleman proposes to prevent those effects upon nearby communities is in interference with the authority and the preemption authority of the Federal Railroad Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Mulvey, one of the commissioners of the Surface Transportation Board, said, "I believe that an amendment such as this is necessary to redress the growing misuse of Federal railroad preemption law ..... with respect to solid waste transload facilities." But he, too, expresses concerns that it could be interpreted too broadly to frustrate the zoning of legitimate solid waste transfer facilities.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I agree with what the chairman said. Again, I don't disagree with the situation that is occurring that appears significant in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned, as I stated, that this language is going to allow communities to stop legitimate and law-abiding rail entities and operations, to stop them when they don't like it. I have great concern in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the trash issue, as I said, is significant. Pennsylvania is the biggest importer of trash in the Nation with 10 million tons every year coming across the border into Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern is that this problem will get pushed out of New Jersey and out of other States into States that are more willing to handle it, and as I said, we all produce trash. I'm sure today I've got half a waste can or more in my office. My community produces trash. Communities have to deal with that problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, nobody wants a landfill in their backyard, but the reality is we've got to have landfills. We've got to have these waste transfer stations. We've got to make sure, though, that people that are operating them are operating them properly so that we're not damaging the environment, that we aren't doing negative things to our communities because, as we heard yesterday, outside of Philadelphia and Bensalem, Mr. Murphy's district, they were trying to redevelop their town, and right  across the street, somebody wants to come in and put in a waste treatment facility or waste transfer station that's not going to be positive for that community.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This is not a partisan issue, as these two Republican leaders of Bensalem will attest to. After all, ensuring that our neighborhoods are kept clean and safe isn't about politics; it is about doing what is right. With this amendment, we have an opportunity to protect our neighborhoods. I urge swift passage of this important amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just thank Mr. Murphy, who I should say is a cosponsor with me of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I include for the Record the letter from the Commissioner of the Surface Transportation Board, Mr. Francis Mulvey, to Chairwoman Brown where he indicates his support of the amendment. He does, as the chairman of the full committee says, believe that there may be some issues that will have to be worked out as we move to conference or whatever on this. I would assure my colleague from Pennsylvania that we would try to do that. I urge support of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, October 17, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRWOMAN BROWN: I am writing in support of the pending Pallone-Murphy Amendment to be offered to <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007. In accordance with my testimony before the Subcommittee at yesterday's hearing, I believe that an amendment such as this is necessary to redress the growing misuse of federal railroad preemption law, 49 U.S.C. 10501(b), with respect to solid waste transload facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned that the Amendment could possibly be interpreted too broadly to enable State and local governments to frustrate the zoning of legitimate solid waste transload facilities, but I believe this is an issue that can be worked out as the Amendment and Bill move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to echo my testimony yesterday by making it clear that determining where the boundaries of federal preemption lie is a delicate process, as shown by the Board's and courts' thoughtful interpretations over the past 12 years since the passage of the ICC Termination Act of 1995. I do not believe that the scope of preemption should be narrowed any more than is necessary to prevent its misuse. Under no circumstances should State and local police powers be circumscribed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your consideration of my views. I remain available to answer any further questions you or other Members may have about this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sinerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Francis P. Mulvey,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the amendment from my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone and my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murphy to the Federal Railway Safety and Safety Improvement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Pallone and Mr. Murphy's amendment would exclude from the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board the regulation and approval of solid waste transfer and processing facilities near railway stations. This amendment addresses a serious environmental concern in allowing companies to skirt solid waste regulations and I fully support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 gave the STB jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers and authorized the STB to pre-empt Federal, State or local laws in conflict with Commerce Clause. This law was intended to extend the STB's authority only to railroad operations, not to the operation of facilities located by rail services or to businesses which have a connection to a rail company. Unfortunately, confusion about Congressional intent behind the ICCTA has been  exploited by some companies to override State and Federal environmental regulations for the sake of profit and have put both the environment and the public health at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is through a gross misinterpretation of ICCTA that the STB allows companies to seek Federal preemption of a host of environmental and public health laws by simply locating their facilities on railroad property. One of the more egregious examples of this abuse is the building of solid waste facilities along rail lines. In the State of New Jersey, the STB has allowed nine railroad transfer facilities to operate under the supposed Federal preemption supposedly authorized through the ICCTA--at  least one of which handles toxic waste.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of these facilities are little more than trash heaps which do not have to comply with either State or Federal solid waste regulations. This is unacceptable. We have spent the last decade working to clean up the damage that has been caused by improper waste disposal, and continuing to allow companies to exploit the ICCTA is a step backwards in the progress we have made in regulating this industry. Mr. Pallone and Mr. Murphy's amendment would take a crucial step towards correcting  this problem and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it has been over a decade since Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Clause Termination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I have the deepest respect for my colleague from New Jersey who sponsored this amendment, I feel his amendment is overly broad and violates the letter and spirit of the ICCTA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Gentleman from New Jersey's amendment, any State and local agency can regulate railroad-owned, solid waste rail transfer facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adoption of this amendment would mean that if a railroad were to try and establish a solid waste transload facility, local government authorities would have very few checks on their ability to regulate this industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no jurisdictional requirements in this amendment, no limit to the number of authorities which could mount challenges. It would begin to dismantle, piece by piece, the federal preemption that is integral to our national rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the individuals supporting this amendment today will tell you how states are unable to protect their citizens under the current guidelines set forth by the Surface Transportation Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What you may not hear, is that a State can protect the health and safety of their citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Should companies violate the laws and regulations governing health and safety problems, a state can use its police power, take the offending railroad to court, or petition the Surface Transportation Board to halt the railroads operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Jersey was able to shut down three waste transload facilities earlier this year, because the facility violated the fire safety laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These transportation facilities were not created through judicial fiat, they are defined in the very legislation we crafted a decade ago. They were addressed wholesale because we knew that to grant certain commodities preemption, and deny it to others, would create a daunting patchwork of regulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, as well intentioned as it may be, begins the path down that slippery slope. What's next? Will a state's department of environmental protection decide that it doesn't like the transportation of coal, or liquid natural gas, because of the pollution it may cause?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge the defeat of this poorly crafted amendment,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. Rohrabacher:</chair>
  <chair> Page 12, line 16, insert the following new paragraph before the close quotation mark:</chair>
  <chair> "(5) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2011 such sums as may be necessary to design and develop a pilot electric cargo conveyor system for the transportation of containers from ports to depots outside of urban areas.".&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to House Resolution 724, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering on behalf of myself and my colleague from California (Ms. Richardson) provides authorization for the rails of the next generation. As this Congress looks at ways to curb pollution, new technologies such as electric conveyor systems are key in reducing our impact on the environment, while getting the job done more efficiently, thus promoting the economic prosperity and, of course, the well-being of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, logjams occur as offloaded freight is bottlenecked at our ports waiting for trucks to take containers to interior rail and trucking hubs. Electric conveyor systems, on a set rail, can streamline this process, reducing costs to the American consumer as well as eliminating pollution that would otherwise come from these container hauling trucks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also an issue of safety. American ports are found in coastal metropolitan areas. As the Minnesota bridge disaster reminds us, it is fitting that we look at the safety of our current infrastructure. But we should also look towards the future and the systems that will be in place in the years ahead. Electric conveyor systems have already proven to be extremely safe and efficient, but we would be remiss if we do not offer these systems the same funds for safety that we offer our current rail  lines, and that is what this amendment seeks to accomplish. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I do not oppose the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself 2 3/4  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a proposal that really does have a thousand fathers. The distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is an advocate for this initiative; I believe the Governor of his State is an advocate for it, as the mayor of Los Angeles is an advocate for it. I know the City of San Diego and their planning organization are for this kind of initiative, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Port of Los Angeles-Long Beach is an advocate for  this. And I am an advocate for it. And I think that in this initiative we have found the ideal solution to intermodalism, to movement of goods, reduction of noise, of pollution, of accidents, of intersection of goods, people, and vehicles by adopting the maglev technology. This was an idea that I advocated well in advance of ISTEA in 1991. We got first funding in the ISTEA legislation for study of maglev technology. And then in TEA-21, under then Chairman Shuster, advocating experimental</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This can be a very exciting, successful initiative. We have a paying customer, containers. And with a combination of some Federal grant funding and loans from the railroad infrastructure loan program to whatever the sponsoring authority may be, it can be a State, it can be a railroad, this project can be very successful. We can have one not only in California but in discussion with the Chair of the Rail Subcommittee, Ms. Brown, the Port of Jacksonville would be interested in such an  initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just want to point out that while the gentleman advances the cause, it is not limited only to California. The language of the amendment says, authorized to be appropriated such funds as may be necessary to design and develop a pilot electric cargo conveyor system for the transportation of containers from ports to depots outside of urban areas. A brilliant solution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would yield myself 1 minute and I would just suggest that that is the kind of opposition that I like. I thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vision Mr. Oberstar has just laid out is exactly what we are trying to do. Mr. Oberstar, of course, is responsible for today, but he is also, by working together with us, we are trying to make sure that we are building a better tomorrow based on the technology of tomorrow that will overcome some of the problems of today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let us note for the record, this is probably the first legislative step toward the direction of fulfilling the vision that Mr. Oberstar just outlined for us of what the potential of this is. So if they go back in history and 5, 10 years from now we have an incredible working system that takes tens of thousands of trucks off the road and it helps our environment, we can look back to this vote and this floor discussion as the first step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate that very much and look forward to working with you. I think this is the perfect bipartisan effort where all of us can come together of any project that I know of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="409888" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as Mr. Rohrabacher pointed out, this authorizes a program to install a pilot electric conveyer system for cargo. There have been several concepts developed for the Port of Los Angeles to move cargo using electric trucks, LNG trucks, automated shuttles, and even maglev. The general idea is, as Mr. Rohrabacher has pointed out, to get rid of the diesel trucks and move the cargo to outlying areas for transload to trains or truck. This would cut air pollution  and potentially cut the congestion that exists now in the Port of Los Angeles, and would certainly benefit all of the Nation as we develop these types of transportation ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support Mr. Rohrabacher's goal of reducing congestion and pollution and urge support of the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>How much time do I have remaining?</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman has 2 1/2  minutes remaining. The gentleman from California has 1 minute remaining.</chair>

    <paragraph>I yield 1 1/2  minutes to the distinguished Chair of our Subcommittee on Rail, Ms. Brown.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I know that this is something that my friend Juanita Millender-McDonald supported and worked hard to realize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representing the Port of Jacksonville, I fully understand how important it is to efficiently and safely unload cargo and get it moving to its final destination. As business continues to grow at ports across America, it is becoming increasingly necessary to find alternatives to trucking this increased cargo through towns and communities. This pilot program is one option for transporting cargo outside major urban areas, and we need to seek other solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I know that you addressed this issue, but can you tell us a little bit more how this pilot program will work? Will it limit itself to people in California, or would people in Jacksonville, all over the country, be able to participate in this pilot program?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentlewoman would yield, the language is very broad. It says: Such sums as may be necessary to design and develop a pilot electric conveyor system. But I think that is not limited to one. That is broad enough language to be interpreted as to embrace more than one such project. It would be done by the Department of Transportation through the Federal Railroad Administration with appropriated funds. But also, the applicant has the authority under existing law in the SAFETEA-LU  bill to apply for some of the $35 billion in railroad infrastructure loan funding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for his support and partnership in this. I would hope that we start with a demonstration at the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach, whereas it would take tens of thousands of trucks off the road just there, but something that would be a model for the rest of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me also suggest that, as we have discussed, this is a project that could well pay for itself and be done with having people who are using the system pay back what the cost of the system is. So it is something that we can work on and mold together in a way that will really serve the environment and make our country more efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me note that Juanita Millender-McDonald, who was the Representative from Long Beach as well as myself, was a great supporter of this concept. We talked many times on this. Maybe we will name it after her in her memory. We miss her today. But Ms. Richardson who took her place is very supportive of this as well, so we are working on this as a team. I deeply appreciate this positive spirit on both sides of the aisle, and ask my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier, I said this project has a thousand fathers. I should have said a thousand parents, because there are mothers and fathers in the presence of the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentlewoman from California, the newest member of our committee, Ms. Richardson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I love the gentleman's enthusiasm. Mr. Rohrabacher has from the time we began discussing this project been a very vigorous and knowledgeable supporter of the project. He has  also worked to bring local interests in to work with the Governor of California. I think with this enthusiasm and with this broad bipartisan and bicoastal interest, the Pacific Coast and the Atlantic Coast, that we will see something happen. There is going to be a project  resulting from this when we get this legislation enacted.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412201" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress has a spending problem. The budget passed earlier this year anticipates spending $2.9 trillion over the next 12 months. That is more money than the total value of all goods and services produced in Germany at $2.87 trillion, China at $2.52 trillion, or the United Kingdom at $2.34 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This spending problem is further evidenced by a whopping $9 trillion national debt, a debt that can only be addressed by drastic change. Those changes will only come as Congress prioritizes and makes tough decisions, funding priorities and cutting wasteful spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Safety is an important issue. No one argues that point. But spending taxpayer money to rename a 40-year-old agency is just plain ridiculous, and yet, that is one of the things that this bill proposes to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Railroad Administration was created in 1966. Today's bill proposes to change the name of the agency to insert the word "safety" renaming it the Federal Railroad Safety Administration. While this sounds innocuous enough, it raises some very practical considerations for spending the American taxpayers' money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Railroad Administration has 837 employees. Printing new business cards for everyone to reflect their new agency, at a cost of $30 per person, will cost taxpayers more than $25,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider also that the agency has eight regional offices across the country, all of which will require new signs to reflect the new agency name. Again, this raises questions: How much taxpayer money will the agency spend for these new signs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much taxpayer money will the agency spend to print new letterhead to reflect this name change, an agency that spent nearly $200,000 in printing costs last year?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much taxpayer money will the agency spend issuing new regulations that reflect this new name?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this. While all of these expenses are relatively modest in light of the $1.11 billion proposed to be authorized by this bill over 4 years, this kind of spending is unnecessary and, frankly, ridiculous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the point of this bill is safety, then why not spend the money on safety? Don't spend the hard-earned money of American families and individuals just to rename an agency. That type of spending is an out and out waste of taxpayer money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, Congress has a spending problem. The only way Congress will cure that problem is to prioritize, make tough decisions and learn, like everyone else, how to live within a budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us spend money on the priorities that serve the American people best. Let us save this kind of name-changing, sign-adjusting business until a day that we have extra money and no deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote against needless spending, and please join me in voting for this motion to recommit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The only thing I can say for it is that I wish the gentleman had been here in 1995 when the Republican majority forced upon National Airport and the Washington Metropolitan Area Government Authority, Airport Authority, the changing of the name to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. And they did so, I say to the gentleman from Idaho, with their finger in the nose of the authorities, saying either you make the changes and you spend the money or we'll take your money away from  you. And they said it right here on this floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was the purpose of changing the name of that airport? No useful benefit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are creating a new safety emphasis for the Federal Railroad Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, this committee and this Congress created a Motor Carrier Safety Administration. I didn't hear anybody jump up on the floor and say, Oh, my God, it's going to cost money to change the stationery of the agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Baloney. It doesn't cost any money at all. You just use up the existing stationery you have and print new ones. It doesn't cost you any new money. This is bogus. I have no idea where people get such ideas as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when it comes to some priority that some people on the other side of the aisle had in previous Congresses, they shove it down the throat of the Washington Metropolitan Airport Authority and say, You will change the name on all the facilities. You will change, they said to the National Park Service, signs leading to the airport, and you will do it at your expense, at the Federal Government expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here it's going to be a change of stationery. You run out of the existing stationery they have and print new ones that says "safety" on it.</paragraph>
