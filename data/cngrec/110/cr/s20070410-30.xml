    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge a very special occasion that only comes around once in a lifetime. This year Bob and Jan Fraumann will celebrate 50 years of marriage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob and Jan are very special members of my church, Mt. Zion United Methodist Church, in Marietta, GA. Bob has been our Director of Music for as long as I can remember. Every Sunday is a musical experience, but Easter, Christmas, and Independence Day are always exceptional. Bob works extremely hard for months to arrange remarkable music programs for those very special celebrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob and Jan are blessed with two sons, Rick and Greg, and four grandchildren. Rick and his wife Laura have two children, Bobbie and Brittany. Greg and his wife Terri have two children, Victoria and Sofia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased today to join with my pastors, Steve Lyle and Laura Parker, and our entire congregation in congratulating Bob and Jan Fraumann on this truly momentous occasion. It is a privilege to stand here in this Senate and honor this tremendous milestone that embodies the profound love and commitment they have for one another. Their marriage is an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
