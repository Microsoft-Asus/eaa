    <paragraph>Mr. President, April 24 is Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day, which is a great opportunity for people who are in a position to do so to give their kids a better idea of what they do for a living. In my office, we had a short social time this morning to allow the children of staff members to gather and talk about their experience. Participation in Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day can be fun for the parents and the children. But at its heart, this day is a part of a broad  effort to reach pay equity for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, we marked Equal Pay Day, the point in 2008 when the average woman's wages finally catch up with what the average man earned in 2007. The numbers are sobering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equal pay has been the law since 1963. But today, 45 years later, women are still paid less than men--even when women have similar education, skills, and experience. While women's wages have risen in all States, in inflation-adjusted dollars, since 1989, the typical full-time woman worker does not make as much as the typical man in any State. At the present rate of progress, it will take 50 years to close the wage gap nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, women were paid 77 cents for every dollar men received. That is $23 less for every $100 worth of work women do--$23 less to spend on groceries, housing, child care, and other expenses. Nationwide, working families lose $200 billion of income annually to the wage gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over a lifetime of work, the 23 cents on the dollar women are losing adds up. The average 25-year-old working woman will lose more than $523,000 to unequal pay during her working life. These figures are even worse for women of color. And because women are paid less now, they have less money to set aside for retirement, and they will earn lower pensions than men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the motivation behind Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day is to expose children of both genders to professional fields that historically have been dominated by men. This day is one of many initiatives developed to encourage girls and young women in their education and professional journeys. Professional and student organizations, such as the Society of Women Engineers, offer a support network for those young women who are making their mark in professions that historically have not  seen many women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day can help both girls and boys see the career opportunities that may be open to them if they stay in school, set goals, and study. I commend the employers and employees who are able to participate today. I would also like to congratulate and encourage the children who are sizing up options for their future careers. Let us keep in mind today that we need to keep working to enable every child to achieve his or her full potential, and we need to ensure that  women are fully and fairly compensated for all the work they do.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in honor of today's Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day when, over the past 15 years, individuals, families and workplaces have joined in expanding opportunities and transforming the lives of millions of girls and boys both nationally and internationally. I want to take this opportunity to discuss the importance of family in creating an active and resourceful citizenship and workforce for the future. As our Nation continues in its historical role as a melting  pot, the importance of international adoption in the fabric of American families continues to grow. Mr. Paul Hanly Furfey stated that "The first, the most fundamental right of childhood is the right to be loved. The child comes into the world alone, defenseless, without resource. Only</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United Nations Population Division gathered data from more than 100 countries and found that in a world of 2.2 billion children under the age of 18, fewer than 12 per 100,000 are being adopted. In other words, in a total global population of 6.5 billion, there are only about 260,000 adoptions of all kinds annually including those within countries, across borders and of step children. In the United States we have seen an upward trend in international adoptions from 7,083 in 1990 to 17,718  in 2000 and over 20,000 international adoptions in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have received several letters of concern from many Arkansans inquiring as to what the U.S. Government is doing to help these children find their way to loving homes in Arkansas. In fact, the United States has taken several important steps to protect the rights of the child and to assist families in the international adoption process. From a global level, the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption--Hague Adoption Convention--a broad multilateral  treaty, was signed by the United States in March of 1994. In 2000, the Senate and the House passed the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 to implement the Convention. In 2006, the Department of State issued the final rule on the Accreditation and Approval of Agencies and Persons to implement the Convention and the Intercountry Adoption Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Legislation to help adoptive families pay for expenses associated with adoption procedures was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to make improvements to the Internal Revenue Code to add a two-part adoption assistance tax relief program. The tax relief for adoption expenses has helped many families to be able to afford the financial costs of the actual adoption process. The Department of Homeland Security now issues immigrant visas to children entering the United States with adoptive parents  who are U.S. citizens under the I-800 Visa Program, making them U.S. citizens when they reach U.S. soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On my part, I have signed several letters to international leaders concerning the importance of transparency in the adoption process in all countries, particularly in the signatories of the Hague Adoption Convention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our recognition of today's Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day provides us with a great opportunity to recognize the unique role and contributions of adoptive families in our country. Families created through adoption are special. They go through so much time and energy to find each other. We must celebrate these families who through perseverance and determination become whole and provide a loving environment for our next generation.</paragraph>
