    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this morning in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="76">H. Res. 76</bill>, a resolution to create a national holiday in honor of a great human being, C&amp;#233;sar Ch&amp;#225;vez.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, already nine States celebrate his life. The legacy that he left on the history of this Nation must be recognized. He made a difference not only for Latinos, not only for migrant workers, but for the poor and the working poor, and he also built a coalition of conscience across racial and economic boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded today of the political support C&amp;#233;sar provided to me during my first campaign for the California legislature. He truly helped me win my very first election, and for that I am deeply grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the movement for a national holiday in honor of this great civil and human rights leader and such an important historical figure of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Feliz cumpleanos, C&amp;#233;sar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Si se puede.</paragraph>
