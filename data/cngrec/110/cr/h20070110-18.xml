    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in this week of recognition and admiration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I am reminded of a book he wrote and the words "why we can't wait" which emphasized the urgency of the civil rights movement for the then Negro in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we rise to indicate to America we cannot wait for an increase in the minimum wage. We cannot wait for that waitress who asked me when she would be able to provide more for her children and have the opportunity for the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By raising the minimum wage today, we impact 7 million women, 3.4 million parents, and we raise it from $5.15 to $7.25 over 2 years. In 9 years, 10 years, we have not raised the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say this in the backdrop of the President's speech tonight on Iraq, because that theme follows why we can't wait for a successful policy in Iraq, and why we can't wait to have the President change directions to ensure that we eliminate that failed policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to stand for a new direction in Iraq, saving our soldiers and bringing them home with dignity. And we are going to stand for working families in America.</paragraph>
