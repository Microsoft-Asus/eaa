    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and exclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day is a solemn time when we, as a Nation, commemorate the ultimate sacrifice that our brave men and women in uniform have made for us. Sadly, there are  those who, despicable as it may be, desecrate the grave sites of these heroes. In cemeteries across our Nation, thieves have even looted the metal parts of grave markers and sold them for scrap metal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3480">H.R. 3480</bill>, the Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act, which will protect and honor the final resting places of our Nation's veterans. This bill will ensure that penalties are in place so that these despicable thieves are appropriately punished and would-be thieves are effectively deterred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines in order to provide a fitting sentence for all offenses involving the desecration of, theft of, or trafficking in a grave marker, monument, headstone, or other object that had permanently marked a veteran's grave site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend our colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Carney), for his leadership in this unfortunately necessary measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, particularly as we prepare for the solemn observance of Memorial Day. These veterans have sacrificed greatly for us, and they deserve no less than the highest honor and dignity for their final resting places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3480">H.R. 3480</bill>, the Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act, provides increased penalties for the desecration of the graves of America's fallen soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that we consider this bill today on the eve of Memorial Day, a national holiday to honor those who died in defense of our country. Sadly, last Memorial Day weekend in Washington State, the graves of 97 war veterans were desecrated. American flags honoring those men and women were burned or replaced with homemade swastika flags.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, over 700 markers were stolen from the graves of American soldiers. These bronze plaques and flag holders were placed at every veteran's grave as a memorial to honor their service. In Texas, the grave of Purple Heart recipient Lance Corporal Jeremy Burris was desecrated only 2 days after his burial. Flower arrangements, personal notes, and flags decorating the grave site were torn down and destroyed. All of this destruction to steal and sell wire flower  stands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Georgia, a bronze statue depicting a Marine's boots, rifle and helmet was ripped out of the ground at the grave site of Corporal John Stalvey. Other graves have also been vandalized to steal the bronze plates traditionally placed on the grave sites of fallen service men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the price of bronze on the rise, thieves are stealing these markers to sell as scrap metal. The cost of brass markers has risen to $28 each. Some counties cannot afford to replace the metal markers, so they are being forced to turn to cheaper aluminum markers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether these acts are motivated by greed or protest, destroying the grave of any person, let alone those who have died fighting for our country, is inexcusable, and these crimes must be met with swift and strong punishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the desecration of these graves not only disrespects the men or women that rest there, it dishonors those serving in our Armed Forces today. <bill type="h" number="3480">H.R. 3480</bill>, the Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act, directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend its sentencing guidelines to provide a sentencing enhancement for any offense involving the desecration or theft of, or trafficking in, grave markers of veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's fallen heroes fought and died for their country, for our country, and their memories deserve better. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is of great necessity that we rise today to stand against this horrible and devastating act, and that is, the desecration of our veterans' or our fallen soldiers' graves. So I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3480">H.R. 3480</bill>, the Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act of 2008, in honor and tribute to Jeremy Burris of Texas, whose grave site was desecrated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I also suggest that on the eve of the commemoration of Memorial Day, when we acknowledge and honor and pay tribute to our fallen soldiers, this is enormously important legislation. Because the desecration of veterans' graves is becoming so pervasive, States have acted by replacing the stolen markers with aluminum markers instead of the brass and bronze markers they once used. How insulting, how low. And so it is important that this Congress say to the American people, and those who would  do such dastardly deeds, we will accept it no more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the price of aluminum sharply on the rise, it is expected that aluminum that is being utilized instead of the bronze may also be stolen. So this important legislation is asking for enhanced penalties to make a very strong statement that this is an intolerable act and an unacceptable act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we mourn our most recent dead, those who have fallen in Iraq, how much more can families tolerate to know that they buried their loved ones, and then someone desecrated their graves?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that this legislation pass today to recognize again the great debt of gratitude and the great debt of appreciation that we owe our fallen soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the great British leader, Winston Churchill, famously stated, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We owe, many of us, all of us, so much to the few who have fallen on behalf of this great Nation. And so I support, enthusiastically, the legislation sponsored by our good friend, Representative Carney from Pennsylvania, the Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act of 2008. Let this be an important statement that we will not tolerate the continuation of such desecration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3480">H.R. 3480</bill>, the "Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act of 2008."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important piece of legislation is an effort to stop the theft of Veterans' grave markers. Increasingly, these grave markers are being sold to scrap yards and recycling centers as scrap metal. The bill directs the Sentencing Commission to review and enhance the laws that currently protect Veteran grave markers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the desecration of veterans' graves is becoming so pervasive, States have acted by replacing the stolen markers with aluminum markers instead of the brass and bronze markers they once used. However, with the price of aluminum sharply on the rise, it is expected that these will soon be stolen also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The May Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act of 2008 will bring attention to this issue and increase penalties for this crime so that thieves no longer consider robbing grave markers for scrap metal as easy money and will think twice about desecrating the tombstone of a fallen war veteran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that we should celebrate our veterans after every conflict, and I remain committed, as a Member of Congress, to ensuring that we respect our fallen veterans. Veterans have kept their promise to serve our Nation; they have willingly risked their lives to protect the country we all love. We must now ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, there are 25 million veterans in the United States. There are more than 1,633,000 veterans living in Texas and more than 32,000 veterans living in my Congressional district alone. On this Veterans Day, I hope we will all take the time to show appreciation to those who have answered the call to duty. As the great British leader Winston Churchill famously stated, "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the approval of legislation on June 1, 1954, November 11th became a day to honor American veterans of all wars. Later that same year, on October 8th, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, himself a decorated veteran of war, issued the first "Veterans Day Proclamation" which stated in part: "In order to insure proper and widespread observance of this anniversary, all veterans, all veterans' organizations, and the entire citizenry will wish to join hands in the common purpose." It was with that  endearing spirit that America celebrated the first Veterans Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must always remember the debt that we owe our fallen veterans that have paid the ultimate sacrifice. From the four surviving World War I veterans known to be living in the United States, to the over 300,000 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom we expect to see by the end of 2008. Our gratitude must continue to be unwavering to our fallen soldiers and veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the words of President John F. Kennedy, "As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them." It is not simply enough to sing the praises of our Nation's great veterans; I firmly believe that we must demonstrate by our actions how proud we are of our American heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I believe it is necessary for the Nation to act now so that we all can pay respect, tribute, and homage to the lives of the fallen armed services veterans who have fought to keep America free and have fought to make sure that all people and nations partake in the universal freedoms that we find so important in this country. These individuals have given so much and have paid us the ultimate sacrifice: the sacrifice of their lives. The  least that we can do, is ensure that these veterans rest eternally in peace and that their grave markers are not stolen for the profit of a few. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
