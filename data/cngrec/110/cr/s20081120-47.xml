    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to Wayne Riddle, who is retiring at the end of this year from the Congressional Research Service. Wayne is the model of a dedicated and talented public servant. He has spent his career working out of the public eye for the greater good, providing excellent assistance to all of us in Congress for over three decades, and also taking time to mentor younger staffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wayne is a graduate of the University of Virginia. He earned a master's degree in economics from George Washington University while working at the Congressional Research Service, where he has spent the past 36 years serving as a key analyst on elementary and secondary education, and twice as head of the Education and Labor Section at CRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout that time, Congress has given high priority to strengthening the Nation's schools, and Wayne has been helping us immensely every step of the way. He began not long after the passage of the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965--the Federal Government's major program to improve educational opportunities for low-income students. Wayne has been indispensable in our work on every subsequent reauthorization of the act and on all our other efforts on elementary and secondary  education, including the Goals 2000 Act during the Clinton administration and the No Child Left Behind Act during the current Bush administration. His guidance, support and knowledge on issues big and small have been invaluable to us time and again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Wayne retires to devote more time to his family, I know that his colleagues at CRS will miss him, and so will we. I wish him a long, healthy, and happy retirement. He certainly deserves it, because he has served our country well, and made a very real difference in the lives of countless children who have benefited in their education because of his expertise and dedication.</paragraph>
