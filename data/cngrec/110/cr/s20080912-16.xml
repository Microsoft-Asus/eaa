  <narrative>CLEAR LAKE COMMUNITY SCHOOL EDUCATION -- (Senate - September 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8476">S8476</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United States, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools have an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores are among the highest in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the dedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the Clear Lake Community School District, and to report on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among educators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public schools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts--everything from updating fire-safety systems to building new schools or renovating  existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal funding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Clear Lake Community School District received a 2002 Harkin grant totaling $1 million which it used to help build an addition to the high school to provide new classrooms for science, family and consumer science and art. This school is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the educational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, it is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves. The district also received fire safety grants totaling $127,481  to install new fire alarms and detectors in several schools in the district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. They are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a tremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned citizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in the Clear Lake Community School District. In particular, I would like to recognize the leadership of the board of education--Ron Andrews, Tom Lovell, Paul Stevenson, Sandy Christ and Deborah Betz and former board members Joel  Secory, Michael Baker, Lynn Scribbins and Tammy Schwichtenberg. I would also like to recognize superintendent Dwight Pierson, former superintendent Dr. Michael Tegland, former high school principal John Chalstrom, facilities director Kelly McLaughlin, high school principal Jay Mathis, business manager Lorna Leerar and facilities coordinator for AEA 267 Bill Schutz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in  Iowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings and facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation or replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, some 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The harsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United States is nearly 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too often, our children visit ultra-modern shopping malls and gleaming sports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown or antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our young people about our priorities. We have got to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in the Clear Lake Community School District. There is no question that a quality public education for every child is a top priority in that community. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new school year.</paragraph>
