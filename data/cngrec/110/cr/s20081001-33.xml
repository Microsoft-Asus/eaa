    <paragraph>Mr. President, today marks the full operational launch of the U.S. Africa Command, known as AFRICOM. I have long supported the idea of a unified regional combatant command for Africa that recognizes the continent's growing strategic importance for U.S. security and that is coordinated with other U.S. agencies. As I have discussed many times on the Senate floor, we can not pretend that weak and failing states, protracted violent conflicts, maritime insecurity, narcotics and weapons  trafficking, large-scale corruption, and the misappropriation and exploitation of natural resources are not relevant to our long-term interests. At the same time, there are exciting economic and social developments underway across Africa that provide openings for the United States to help save lives,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Toward that end, the standup of AFRICOM presents both opportunities and risks. Indisputably, our Nation's military strength is one of our greatest assets and may be necessary to deal with some of the emerging national and transnational threats, such as narcotics trafficking, piracy, and terrorism. Military training, equipping, and logistical support are essential to develop strong, disciplined national militaries and also strengthen regional peacekeeping, especially with African Union missions  currently operating in Somalia and Sudan. Furthermore, in many postconflict societies, such as Liberia, our military expertise can assist in demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration while also helping to rebuild that country's army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, while militaries make important contributions in these areas, they are insufficient to address the underlying causes of violence and instability in Africa. Lasting security requires reconciling political grievances, improving governance, strengthening the rule of law, and promoting economic development: tasks for which our military, or any military for that matter, cannot be the lead. To advance and support those tasks, the United States needs to continue to invest in our diplomatic,  economic, humanitarian, and development capacities on the continent. We need a unified interagency approach to these challenges in which AFRICOM is supporting, not eclipsing, the work of our diplomats, our aid workers, and other key partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned that the opposite is happening. Despite initial ambitions to have 25 percent of AFRICOM's headquarters' positions filled by nonmilitary staff, that number has been severely reduced because of resource and staffing limitations in civilian agencies. Furthermore, a report by the Government Accountability Office published this July stated that concerns persist among civilian agencies and nongovernmental organizations that the military is becoming the lead for U.S. policy in Africa.  Even as Pentagon officials claim this is not their intention, it is hard to argue with the numbers. While civilian agencies operating abroad continue to face resource constraints, more and more resources are being invested in military relationships and assistance in Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given this context, it is not surprising that some are casting AFRICOM's emergence as a signal of further militarization of U.S. Africa policy. Such perceptions of militarization are dangerous and risk undermining our ability to engage local populations. As I have said many times, the military has a critical role to play in helping Africans address their security challenges, but we must be careful that it does not outweigh or overshadow other forms of engagement. This is especially true in cases  where local security forces are engaging in repressive tactics or committing serious human rights abuses, such as in Chad or Ethiopia. In these cases, we run a very real risk that U.S. military engagement could be seen by local populations as complicit in those abuses and become a target of resulting grievances. Before we jump at short-term opportunities to exert military influence, we need to consider seriously the long-term risks to U.S. stature and interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is not to say that AFRICOM is not capable of such nuanced strategic planning and interagency coordination. I have met with  General Ward and know that he is aware of both the opportunities and risks as AFRICOM stands up. I still believe that a unified regional combatant command can contribute to broader U.S. Government efforts to confront the many security challenges in Africa and can provide additional tools to pursue coherent and  strategic objectives across the continent. But to fulfill that potential, AFRICOM must demonstrate in its inaugural months and years that it recognizes the unique political realities throughout Africa, concentrates on its defined mandate, and takes its lead from our diplomats. Simultaneously, we in Congress must act to ensure that our diplomats have the resources they need to take that lead in formulating and implementing comprehensive U.S. strategies in Africa.</paragraph>
