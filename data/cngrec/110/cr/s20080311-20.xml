    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letter and listing be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>March 11, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. LEADER: <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, which I introduced yesterday, is a collection of 62 separate legislative measures under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The purpose of the bill is to facilitate consideration in the Senate of the large and growing number of measures relating to protection of natural resources and preservation of our historic heritage that have been passed by the House of Representatives and approved  by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Forty-three of the measures in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> consist of the text of separate bills passed by the House of Representatives, twelve are drawn from separate titles, subtitles, or sections of two other House-passed bills, and two are House-passed concurrent resolutions. Only one provision, section 482, contains new matter that has not passed the House of Representatives.</narrative>
  <narrative>While <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> incorporates a number of provisions of <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill>, the National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of 2007, which I introduced 3 months ago, on December 14, 2007, there are a number of differences between the bills that are dictated by the amount of time that has elapsed since last December and by action that has since taken place in the House of Representatives. Two of the sections included in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> last December were subsequently enacted into  law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, and, accordingly, have been left out of <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>. Eight new provisions, drawn from eight separate House bills or resolutions, have been added. Two of the effective dates in title VIII of <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> have been extended in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> in light of the passage of time since <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> was introduced. In addition, minor modifications were made in a few other provisions.</narrative>
  <narrative>Although <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> has not been referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, all of the House bills that make up <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> or their Senate companions have either been reported or ordered reported by the Committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides that, before proceeding to the consideration of a bill, the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction must certify that each congressionally designated spending item in the bill and the name of the Senator requesting it has been identified and posted on a publicly accessible website. The term "congressionally designated spending item" is broadly defined, in pertinent part, to include " a provision ..... included primarily at the request  of a Senator ..... authorizing ..... a specific amount of discretionary budget authority ..... for ..... expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process."</narrative>
  <narrative>Fifteen of the House-passed measures incorporated into <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> contain provisions authorizing the appropriation of specific amounts targeted to specific entities or localities. These authorizations are included in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> because they are part of the text of the House-passed bills. No Senator submitted a request to me to include them.</narrative>
  <narrative>In the interest of furthering the transparency and accountability of the legislative process, however, I have posted a list of the specific authorizations in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' website. The list includes the name of the principal sponsor of the Senate companion measure that corresponds to the House-passed bill. A copy of the list is attached for your convenience.</narrative>
  <narrative>I previously asked the principal sponsor of the Senate companion measure of each House bill contained in <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> to certify that neither the Senator nor the Senator's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and have posted the certifications I have received on the Committee's website. All certifications received in relation to <bill type="s" number="2483">S. 2483</bill> remain on the Committee's website, where they are available for public inspection in accordance with paragraph 6 of Rule XLIV. I have not received  any requests for new congressionally directed spending items to be included in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill>.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thus, in accordance with Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby certify that each congressionally directed spending item in <bill type="s" number="2739">S. 2739</bill> has been identified through a list and that the list was posted on the Committee's publicly accessible website at approximately 3:00 p.m. on March 11, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Jeff Bingaman,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
