  <narrative>OVERRIDE THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF SCHIP LEGISLATION -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11398]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was important to allow our Republican  colleagues an extra 2 weeks for the veto override vote. It's important for them to get the facts right, important for them to listen to their constituents and actually read the bill, not just accept the President's talking points.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's ironic that one of his arguments is concern about adults who are covered by SCHIP. Yet the States have been encouraged to experiment to help uninsured working families, and the White House, George Bush, has approved those waivers that allowed them that coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill he vetoed was actually more restrictive than current law. It would end coverage for adults after a transition period. It would prohibit the Bush administration, or any administration, from approving more waivers for new States, and parents already enrolled with Bush approval would get reduced matching funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to stop making phony arguments; to listen to the Governors and the overwhelming majority of our constituents and override this cruel veto of health care for our children.</paragraph>
