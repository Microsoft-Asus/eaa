  <narrative>BOISE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER -- (Senate - October 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10309">S10309</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as an Idahoan, I have many reasons to be proud of the accomplishments of fellow Idahoans, and today, I have yet another: in early September, the Federal Aviation Administration notified the Boise Air Traffic Control Tower--BOI ATCT--that it had been selected as National Facility of the Year for fiscal year 2007. In a category that included 112 other facilities nationwide, the BOI ATCT scored higher than the others on safety metrics, employee focus, innovation and customer  service. I congratulate Gordon Stewart, BOI ATCT manager and his staff for their teamwork, positive, winning attitudes and overall excellence. As Gordon noted recently, he and his team are "ever cognizant of the public trust bestowed upon our profession, and with that knowledge we constantly strive to move the bar of excellence higher. ..... The greatest tool at our disposal is communication." This award comes on the heels of a regional award that the BOI ATCT team won for fiscal year 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish BOI ATCT continued success in its service and its highly effective partnerships with the Boise Airport, Idaho Air and Army National Guard, National Interagency Fire Center, passenger and cargo airlines and corporate and general aviation. It is good to know that an airport that I frequently use abides by such high standards of safety and service.</paragraph>
