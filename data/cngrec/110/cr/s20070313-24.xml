    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor in the Record of the Senate the induction of my friend and a wonderful Georgian, Larry Nelson of Marietta, to the World Golf Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry was born on September 10, 1947, in Ft. Payne, AL, and was raised in Acworth, GA. Growing up, he preferred baseball and basketball. It wasn't until after he returned from military service in Vietnam that he actually swung a golf club. The first time he played he broke 100. Within 9 months of taking up the game in earnest, Larry broke 70.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1973, Larry successfully went through the PGA Tour Qualifying School, and his breakthrough came in 1979 when he won twice on the tour and finished second on the money list. In 1981, Larry won the PGA Championship at the Atlantic Athletic Club by four strokes over Fuzzy Zoeller. In 1983, he won his second major, the U.S. Open, at one of the toughest championship courses in the world, Oakmont Country Club just outside of Pittsburgh. And in 1987, Larry repeated his victory in the PGA Championship  with a playoff victory over Lanny Wadkins at PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. In addition, he played on the U.S. Ryder Cup team in 1979, 1981, and 1987.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Larry for almost 40 years. In fact, I sold him a house when he was first starting out. It is also a huge point of pride that I am a member of the Atlanta Country Club where Larry Nelson plays today. However, Larry is more than a terrific golfer. He is also a wonderful husband and father as well as a devout Christian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of my friend Larry Nelson. He is an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
