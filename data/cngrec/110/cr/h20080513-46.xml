    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Eyes of Texas are shining tonight on the life and legacy of Houston news legend Ron Stone. Stone died today at the age of 72.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 30 years, Ron Stone was a fixture on Houston television and the host of one of my favorite shows, the Eyes of Texas, featuring the real-life stories about unique people and places of our great State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though he had countless awards to mark his contributions in the media industry, it was his down to earth, folksy style that endeared him to audiences all across the Houston area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was born in Oklahoma, but Stone came to Houston in the 1960s, and his love for Texas took root then. He said he wasn't born in Texas, but he got there as fast as he could. After retiring from KPRC in 1992, he continued to leave his mark on the industry. He was a recognized filmmaker, author of several books on Texas history and continued his dedication to our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met Ron many years ago while I was a judge in Houston. It was his personal approach to news that set him apart from others, and captivated audiences for more than 30 years. Ron Stone leaves a unique mark on Houston's history. May the Eyes of Texas forever shine on him and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
