  <speaking speaker="400413" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my uncle, Mo Udall, served here in the House of Representatives for 30 years. For the last 10 years, he served with Parkinson's disease, and every day his friends and colleagues saw this crippling disease take a little piece of him. Millions of families are facing the same kind of disabling diseases: Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, lupus and many more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we will consider today on the House floor gives these millions of American families hope. There is great promise in stem cell research. This bipartisan bill would increase the number of embryonic stem cell lines eligible for Federal research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that the President will reconsider his ill advised veto and give American families hope.</paragraph>
