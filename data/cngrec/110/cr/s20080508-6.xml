    <paragraph>Mr. President, today there will be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. The Republicans will control the first half and the majority will control the final half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to amend this consent to note that Senator Allard wishes to say a word about the gentleman who just served as our Chaplain. I ask that his time not be deducted from the minority time in morning business.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="2284">S. 2284</bill>, a bill to restore the financial solvency of the National Flood Insurance Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a reminder, all amendments to the flood insurance bill must be offered today. Senators should expect rollcall votes to occur throughout the day as we work to complete action on the bill. I ask everyone to focus on the amendments and showing up in a timely fashion. We want to complete this as quickly as we can.</paragraph>
