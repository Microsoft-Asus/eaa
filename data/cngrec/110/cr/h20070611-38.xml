    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, just last week I joined my colleagues Congressman Gene Green and Congressman NICK LAMPSON on trying to address the ongoing crisis in our communities, because we have a regional office for passports. Overnight stays, early morning arrivals, families crying and families not being able to be reunited, people traveling for hundreds of miles, and the reason is passport backlog because of no extra staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank the staff who work so hard to ensure that those who came could be served. We asked the State Department today to provide us with temporary permanent workers to carry out the responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also say if there are waivers now being made for places like the Caribbean and Canada, I would only beg that information be given to travelers so they don't go to the airport and not have the necessary documentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I close by saying I am reading today as well that the U.S. military is getting ready to arm the Sunnis. I would say if the Iraq war has come to this, it is time to bring our soldiers home. This is not the way to run a war.</paragraph>
