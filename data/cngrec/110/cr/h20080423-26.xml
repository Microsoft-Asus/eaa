  <narrative>REGULATING THE DISTRIBUTION OF HANDGUNS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2558]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there's entirely too much violence in our country perpetrated by the use of handguns. I come from a rather large city with about 3 million people, but I can tell you there were 22 shootings in Chicago over the weekend. Six individuals were actually killed because of the presence of handguns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must find a better way to regulate the distribution of handguns so that kids growing up can learn to practice peace and not war.</paragraph>
