  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL, in Pasadena, CA, for 50 years of space exploration. Since the launch of Explorer I, America's first spacecraft, on January 31, 1958, JPL has made momentous and historic contributions to our scientific understanding of our vast universe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past five decades, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been a respected leader in furthering scientific knowledge around the world. Explorer 1 was built in less than 3 months, and was the first spacecraft ever launched into space that actually revolved around Earth and provided scientific findings from space. The immense success of Explorer I led to the passage of the Space Act in 1958, which established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the inception of NASA, JPL has been on the forefront of science and technology through its research and exploration of every known planet in our solar system. Subsequent to the success of Explorer I, JPL has continued to have a central role in accomplished space missions, such as exploring our vast solar system with Voyager 1 and 2 and the Mars Exploration Rovers. JPL has also been instrumental in understanding our planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on 50 years of successful and insightful space exploration, and thank the original members of the Explorer I team for their contribution to American history.</paragraph>
