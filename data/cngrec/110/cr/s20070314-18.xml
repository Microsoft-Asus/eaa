    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to the Oregon-Davis Women's High School basketball team for their extraordinary State championship victory. The Bobcats historic 54-46 defeat of Wood Memorial for the Class A State Championship was the first statewide championship for the Bobcats and a proud moment for our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In reading of their victory, I was reminded of what people say about teamwork: that at the end of the day we are only as strong as the shoulders we lean on. The talent of the Bobcats was apparent throughout their stellar season, but it was their extraordinary teamwork that brought the championship trophy to the O-D gymnasium for the first time in school history. The young women of the Oregon-Davis basketball team are a testament to what student athletes should be, and they should be commended  for winning with class, courage, and character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years ago the team lost a dear friend in a tragic automobile accident. Jessica McMullen was the daughter of Tim McMullen, a coach in Florida and a close friend of Terry Minix, the Bobcats' head coach. Jessica, a hard-nosed basketball player, used to help her dad at camps at O-D and was only 16 years old when she died. The day after their championship win, the team was honored in the Oregon-Davis gym, and each team member wore a T-shirt commemorating Jessica's contribution to the Bobcats.  At the ceremony, Aubrey Minix, a lead player on the team, spoke about the championship saying, "It means even more to us because we did want to do it for Jess; it brought us even closer together."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the young women on the O-D team put in countless hours practicing  and developing their skills, the parents and coaching staff dedicated just as much time supporting the team. As a father of two young boys who love to play sports, I know how rewarding it can be to watch my sons' games. I also know how dedicated parents must be to drive their kids to practice every day, make it to the games, and cheer the whole game through. It is this kind of dedication  that builds a support network worthy of a State championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once the playoffs started, the Bobcats' true character shined even brighter as they never lost faith in themselves and prevailed as a team. Their conduct this season should be an example for all other student athletes to follow. I congratulate the Oregon-Davis Bobcats on their State championship and commend them for the example they set for all student athletes who I hope are inspired by their example.</paragraph>
