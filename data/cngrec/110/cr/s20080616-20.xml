  <narrative>ARREST OF BAH&#xC1;'I LEADERS -- (Senate - June 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5653">S5653</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to call attention to the arrest of seven Bah&#xE1;'i leaders in Iran earlier this month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 14, six Iranian Bah&#xE1;'i leaders--Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz  Tavakkoli, and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm, all of Tehran--were arrested and reportedly taken to Evin Prison, the same facility where Haleh Esfandiari, director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars here in Washington, spent 105 days last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, on March 5, another Bah&#xE1;'i leader, Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, also of Tehran, was summoned to the city of Mashhad by the Ministry of Intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned that these arrests signal an escalation of repression against the Bah&#xE1;'i community in Iran. These actions do not befit the rich heritage of Iranian civilization, and I call upon the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran to release the seven Bah&#xE1;'i leaders promptly and unconditionally.</paragraph>
