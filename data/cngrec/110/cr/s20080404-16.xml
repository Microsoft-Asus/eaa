  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor a remarkable man from Michigan, Wally Bronner, who passed away on April 1, 2008, at the age of 81. As the founder of BRONNER'S CHRISTmas WONDERLAND in Frankenmuth, he embodied the spirit of Christmas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege of visiting Wally at his store and it was an amazing experience. His enthusiasm and passion were contagious. He was truly an ambassador for the community of Frankenmuth and the State of Michigan, throughout our country and the world. It is hard to think of Christmas without thinking about Wally Bronner. BRONNER'S CHRISTmas WONDERLAND is truly one of a kind and provides visitors with the opportunity to experience different cultures and Christmas traditions from around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wally Bronner was born and raised in Frankenmuth, MI. He started a sign painting business while in high school and then decorated window displays for a local hardware store. Several merchants approached him about providing them with Christmas decorations and that was the beginning of what has now become BRONNER'S CHRISTmas WONDERLAND, which sits on 45 acres of land with a shipping department that is the size of 5 1/2  football fields and a chapel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wally had a deep faith in God and was passionate about giving back to the community. His generosity has been felt in Frankenmuth and beyond. The Walter and Irene Bronner and Family Foundation, which he founded, has made many special things happen for the community, including a new auditorium at Frankenmuth High School and "Operation Sparkle" that provided the equipment needed to clean up Saginaw.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>BRONNER'S CHRISTmas WONDERLAND will continue to delight people of all ages across the world, but Wally's presence will surely be missed. I want to express my deepest sympathies to his wife Irene Bronner and his children Carla Spletzer, Maria Sutorik and Wayne Bronner. Frankenmuth, the State of Michigan and Christmas lovers everywhere are forever indebted to Wally Bronner.</paragraph>
