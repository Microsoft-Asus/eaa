  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some Democrats like to boast about all the increased spending in their budget plan, but they are less eager to discuss how all this new spending is going to be paid for. That is because it is paid for with the largest tax increase in American history, nearly $400 billion over 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while some Democrats on Capitol Hill may not understand the impact this tax hike would have, my constituents most certainly do. Several have written in to let me know how it would affect their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One woman said it would mean less money for vital health care costs. Another parent said it would hurt her ability to pay for after-school activities for her kids. Someone else said more money for Washington would mean less money for charitable causes. And one single parent told me it would mean, "less food on our table."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the proposed tax increase would affect real families in real ways. Let's balance the budget by reining in spending, not by taking more money from hardworking American families.</paragraph>
