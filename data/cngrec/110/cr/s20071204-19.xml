  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, winter is fast approaching. The Senator from Minnesota was out there with his snow blower and shovel already this weekend. We had from 6 to 10 inches of snow in some portions of the State, 6 inches in the metro area. It was minus 2 when I woke up one day in the Twin Cities, in St. Paul. I traveled around the State. I think it was around minus 8, minus 9, and that is not getting cold yet. In that weather, we actually button the top button but no more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality for many families is cold weather has a lot of people deeply concerned about their ability to keep the heat on. Most of us look forward to the coming of the holiday season as a time we get together with loved ones. For many Americans, this holiday season comes at a time when the cost of energy is skyrocketing. It is raising the level of anxiety as to whether they are going to be able to pay these ever-rising heating costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget a hearing I held for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. I actually did a hearing on the issue of energy costs in my home State last year. I got a chance to listen firsthand to folks who, last year, were impacted by rising energy costs. They bear down on young and old alike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity to meet Deidre Jackson, a single mother, working professional, and college student who saw her heating bill go through the roof. Meanwhile, Lucille Olson told a story familiar to many seniors of the struggle balancing the high cost of health care, prescription drugs, with heating bills that represented 30 percent of her monthly income. Unfortunately, for many seniors, this is not a balancing act that is easily maintained. Stories abound of grandmothers and grandfathers having  to choose between food, medicine, clothing, and heat. This should not happen in America in the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is for stories such as these that we have the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program--LIHEAP--to provide heating and cooling assistance for folks who are struggling to get by. To many Americans, LIHEAP is a real lifeline. More than 70 percent of families receiving LIHEAP assistance have  incomes of less than 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. That is about $21,500 for a family of four. These are truly families who cannot afford to see their  heating bills double. In fact, the majority of households have at least one member who is elderly, disabled, or a child under 5 years of age. These are the most vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, current Federal funding levels are only sufficient to meet the needs of about 16 percent of the eligible households. Many States are trying to meet the needs of more households by providing smaller benefits to each household. Meanwhile, rising energy prices are rapidly reducing the purchasing power of program grants. This is a bad combination. In other words, folks in need are receiving less assistance while the cost of heating increases. Again, this is simply an untenable situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider that home heating prices are projected to reach almost $1,000 a year for a typical family, representing an increase of almost 80 percent from the average cost during the winter of 2001-2002. It is in just 5 years that we have seen this incredible 80-percent increase in cost. In fact, data show we are looking at heating costs rising 15.2 percent this year and record levels for heating oil, propane, and electricity. Experts predict that Minnesotans who use heating oil will probably see  an increase in their bill of 47 percent higher than last year's level. Meanwhile, the cost of natural gas, which most Minnesotans rely on for their heating needs, is up 38 percent from the average cost during the winters of 2000 to 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The heating oil crisis we are facing this year is certainly partially due to America's need to import more and more oil. I have always said there is a national security need to end our dependence on foreign oil. There is also a very focused need in terms of the impact it has on those who simply cannot afford to pay their heating bills. We need to end their dependence on foreign oil. At the same time, we have to make sure to take care of those families in need today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the tools to produce clean and renewable energy here at home, and our heating crisis is only one of the many reasons we need to finish work on the bold energy package the Senate passed this summer and the strong farm bill we have before us now. Those are two important pieces of legislation. I hope we can overcome this partisan divide in Washington that kind of tears us apart and precludes us from getting things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have sat with the Presiding Officer. We talked about renewables and energy and seeing if we can find common ground. We need it in Maryland, we need it in Minnesota, we need it in America. Unfortunately, as much as we would like to transform our energy production before this winter begins, we don't have that option. But we can make sure Americans having a tough time getting by have the assistance  they need to make it through a cold season. For many, it really is a matter of survival. The large percentage of increases in heating costs don't really hit home until you look at a utility bill. A lot of folks will see hundreds of additional dollars on their heating bills this winter. That is a huge expense for a family below the poverty level or for the elderly on fixed incomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I drive by a bus stop on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, about four blocks from my house. There is a bus that stops there that takes you to downtown St. Paul. On a cold winter day, I look as I drive by. There may be a senior, a working mom--and it is cold. I look at the cost of energy and realize we have an obligation to try to do the right thing. That is what LIHEAP is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In life, sometimes the unexpected happens. No matter how much we try, sometimes we just need a helping hand to get back on our feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my hearings back home, I heard a story from a courageous woman from St. Paul, Lori Cooper, who, as a working professional, wife, and mother of a 21-month child, had to figure out how to make ends meet when her husband's health prevented him from working. With heating costs rising, LIHEAP was critical in helping her family make it through the winter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, it is getting harder for States to help families like this one get through winters like this because the appropriation levels have not risen with the inflation since the 1980s. The Labor-HHS-Education bill that the Senate has produced includes a welcome increase, but it is still below the real amount provided 20 years ago. If you look at where we were 20 years ago and factor in inflation, we are below that today. This would be much less problematic if we were not dealing with skyrocketing  heating costs, which is why this winter, as in the winter of 2005-2006, families need emergency LIHEAP assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, I came to the floor with Senators Collins and Snowe to make the case to this body that no one should have to make the choice between basic necessities and heat. Rising to that challenge, we delivered an increase of $1 billion additional LIHEAP funding in 2006. Today, I proudly stand with my colleague from Vermont who, along with 17 Members, introduced the Keep Americans Warm Act to meet the heating crisis we will face this winter. This bill provides $1 billion in emergency  LIHEAP assistance in addition to the funding currently included in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join the 19 of us who are standing behind this bill, who are committed to meeting this urgent need. It took a lot of work to get emergency LIHEAP assistance passed in 2006. We worked very hard. It was difficult. I know it will take a lot of effort this time as well, but I am certain this Senate can come together to aid those who are struggling to provide the bare necessity of heat. I have faith in the potential of this body to act for the greater good, and I look forward  to working together to pass this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
