  <narrative>AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY LEGISLATION -- (Senate - December 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10824">S10824</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I just finished a meeting with my staff representative who has been working with the two Banking Committees and the White House on the Detroit situation that we are trying to work out. I think there has been a whole lot of progress made. I hope the White House will be meeting with Senator McConnell in the near future and we can start moving forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We very much want to complete this as soon as possible. I have had calls from lots of different Senators, all having very important things to do and places to go dealing with their service as a Senator. I think it is going to be very difficult to get a vote today. The legislation is not drafted yet. Most of it is, but there are a couple provisions they are working on. So I think it is very unlikely there will be votes today--not impossible but unlikely. It is more likely there will be something  tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But everyone should understand, if we have a number of Senators who are objecting, who want to slow this down--they have a right to do that; I understand that--we are going to complete the process. That being the case--everyone knows the rules around here; and I do--it may be necessary, if we get some push back from some of our Senators, where we have to go through the process of moving to proceed and filing cloture and all that kind of stuff--if that is the case, everyone should understand we  are going to work until we complete this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want us to make a decision. I am fairly confident that all the work that has gone into this is going to bear fruit, that we will be able to pass legislation that will be good legislation. It will help the workers. When I say "the workers," not only those people who are directly employed by the automobile manufacturers, but the suppliers, the bondholders, and on and on down the road. A lot of people are dependent on our doing something that is appropriate, and I think that  can be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to have a vote on this sometime. We can either have it sooner or we can have it later. But everyone should understand there will be no stalling us from doing this. We are going to complete this legislation. That may mean--and people have heard me talk about this before, but  everyone knows I am serious about this--that may mean we have to work this weekend. I hope that is not the case. Today is Tuesday. But the rules are as they are and  we may have to work through this. We cannot let a few people stop us from doing the people's business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think Senator McConnell and I have the same view; we discussed it this morning, that we want to move forward making sure all parties feel they have been part of the process. There is nothing we could do that would be perfect. So we can only do the best we can; that is, to work through this legislation with the art of compromise. We have had to do that on this piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we will have to wait until the White House completes their meetings with the leadership on the Republican side. Hopefully, today, we can have a better direction as to when we can complete this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the seriousness of what we are engaged in with Detroit and the financial bailout of the banking institutions and the financial apparatus of this country has been very hard and difficult, and we need to keep moving forward. As everyone knows, thousands of jobs have been lost, and we need to get our country back in a position where we are talking about and feel good about the jobs that are being gained, not the jobs being lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So having said that, Mr. President, I will be happy to answer any questions anyone has. They know how to get ahold of me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
