    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate convenes on Monday, February 26, the Senate proceed to the consideration of <bill type="hc" number="63">H. Con. Res. 63</bill>, the House Iraq resolution; that there be 12 hours of debate; that the debate be divided equally between the two leaders; that no amendments or motions be in order; and that the Senate vote on passage of the concurrent resolution at the conclusion of that time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, of course, I will object. This is right back where we were a week ago. As the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished majority whip have said on numerous occasions in the last couple of years, the Senate is not the House. Senate Republicans are going to insist on fair treatment on the most important issue on the minds of the American people today; that is, the war in Iraq. The Senate simply cannot--and I have heard Senator Byrd make  these points on numerous occasions--cannot operate this way. The Senate Republicans insist on one or more amendments on the most important issue confronting our country--the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I had hoped was that the distinguished majority leader and myself would be able to work out a consent agreement that would allow us to have--he would pick his amendment, and it is apparent the amendment the majority would like to have is the House-passed concurrent resolution, and then there would be an alternative, at least one alternative. Many of my Members would like to have more than one alternative in this extremely important debate, but at least one alternative on this side of the  choosing of the majority of Republicans. So, therefore, I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard. The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have told the distinguished Republican leader that when we get to the matter dealing with implementing the 9/11 recommendations, that will be a vehicle which will be open to debate and amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unanimous consent request I propounded would complete work on the Iraq surge issue within a matter of hours, as I indicated, so that we could move within a day, 1 day, to 9/11 and amendments--Warner, Gregg, McCain, whatever amendments the minority wanted to offer; they would certainly be permitted to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We find ourselves in a very unusual position, Mr. President. We tried to proceed to this matter before. Everyone has heard the arguments used to stop us from going forward on this issue. Cloture was not invoked. We need not go over all the reasons, some of which have been outlined by the distinguished Republican leader just a few minutes ago. But there have been those on the other side of the aisle who think we should be in next week. Mr. President, speaking for this Senator, I am happy to be  in next week. If you want to be in next week, we can do that. I have things in Nevada I have wanted to do for a while because I have been here for 5 weeks, but that is OK, I can take care of that, as everyone else can, if necessary. But we find ourselves in the same position, that there is a hesitation on behalf of the minority to go forward on now a very simple matter--a very simple matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Warner-Levin amendment was a little more complicated than the simple House measure which says we support the troops and we are against the surge. That is what we think should be disposed of quickly. We can move to 9/11, all the debates on other things people want to do with Iraq and other issues. Certainly, they can do that. We can spend considerable time on that. As long as progress is being made, there is no reason to file cloture. There are other things we need to do the following week  during the work period.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are anxious to go forward on this issue. We have, again, been stopped from doing that. All the plaintive cries about not being able to debate Iraq--there were opportunities to debate Iraq, and they were turned down. I was disappointed, as I said earlier today, that the people crying the loudest are the people against going forward on Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding, Mr. President, that the order is Senator Leahy has 1 hour right now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Pennsylvania is to be recognized first for 10 minutes and then Senator Leahy.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are not here today, I assume, to debate the substance of the Iraq matter, but it is important to remember that both the majority leader and the majority whip in December were saying a surge might be a good idea, and now they are saying the only resolution we should have before the Senate is one condemning a surge. Let me repeat, that is not the way the Senate works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would like to propose a unanimous consent request, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, February 27, at a time determined by the majority leader, after  consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed en bloc to the following concurrent resolutions under the following agreement: a concurrent resolution, if received from the House, the text of which is at the desk; <bill type="sc" number="7">S. Con. Res. 7</bill>, the Warner resolution which is to be discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee; the McCain-Graham-Lieberman  amendment regarding benchmarks; the Gregg amendment related to funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I further ask unanimous consent that there be a total of 12 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; provided further, that no amendments be in order to any of the measures; further, that at the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to four consecutive votes on the adoption of the concurrent resolutions in the following order, with no further action or intervening debate: first, McCain-Lieberman-Graham, then Gregg, then Warner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I ask unanimous consent that any resolution that does not receive 60 votes in the affirmative, the vote on the adoption be vitiated and the concurrent resolution be returned to its previous status.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, again, this is an attempt to divert attention from the issue before this body; that is, whether there should be a surge in Iraq. That is it--an escalation. And this attempt by my friend, the Republican leader, to divert attention from this very important resolution--we support the troops, we oppose the escalation--is now going to be obfuscated if, in fact, we agree to this request, and therefore we will not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body is going to have the opportunity to vote up or down if, in fact, we can proceed to the resolution. This body will have an opportunity to vote up or down: Do you support the troops? Do you support the surge?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard. The Republican leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if this were to be allowed, this would be the second bill in a row where no amendments would have been offered to a 49-member Republican minority. I have been here a couple of decades now, and I am having a hard time recalling a situation such as this. This is the kind of thing Senator Byrd would get on his feet and decry as inappropriate in a body that thrives on debate and resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is astonishing to me that it is being suggested, on the single biggest issue confronting the American people, that we would have 1 choice, dictated by a Democratic majority of 51 in a body of 100. That is simply unacceptable to this side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the message here from this discussion this morning is that the majority leader and myself ought to sit down, work out a consent agreement, a reasonable consent agreement to both sides, and structure the debate for our return.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will yield to the Senator from Arizona.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, is the minority leader aware of the content of the measure that is proposed by myself, Senator Lieberman, Senator Graham, and others? What it is, is a proposal to set up benchmarks but also to support the surge or the change in strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can the Republican leader explain to me why it is we shouldn't have a proposal that opposes the surge, with a vote on that, and a proposal that supports it and a vote on that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have only been around here 20 years, not nearly as long as Senator Byrd has, whom Senator McConnell referred to, but aren't we allowed to have competing resolutions to debate, with time agreements, such as the minority leader proposed? Why in the world would we not agree to a resolution that would be in opposition to the resolution the majority leader insists on voting on by itself? I have never seen the Senate work this way. I have never seen the Senate only allow one proposal  to be debated and voted on. We have a proposal that we think deserves debate and votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senator from Kentucky, who has been here longer than I have been, if he has ever seen anything quite like this on a major, compelling, overwhelming issue before the American people?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Arizona that I am as astonished as he is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This side was willing, after considerable discussion back and forth, to go down to one alternative, and the Senator from Arizona graciously agreed that his would not be the one, that we would offer the Gregg amendment. Even that was an astonishing concession on the part of the minority, an astonishing concession on the part of the minority to a rather narrow majority to get the debate going. The vote we had a week or so ago was to continue the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The message is clear: The majority can gridlock the Senate over this issue with its insistence there be no choices or the majority leader and I can sit down and do what we should do, which is to reach a reasonable consent agreement for the consideration of alternatives on the single biggest issue confronting America today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I will yield to the Senator from Kansas for a question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300083" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I just wanted to make it clear to myself and others what we are facing here; that is, there would be only one vote we would have on the resolution that was passed in the House, which I feel I could not vote for because it is nonbinding--it is, again, to support the troops but not the mission, which I think is certainly unique in regards to how people feel about this--and that, basically, the McCain resolution, which I support, which sets out the benchmarks to give  to General Petraeus and to give to Prime Minister Maliki to gain some kind of catalyst or effort that would say: Look, this is where the Senate stands, and hopefully we can get these things done so that we can see some progress, to see if it is possible to achieve some security in Iraq and give that Government a political settlement. And the second amendment I am talking about is the one of Senator Gregg, as I understand it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask for regular order.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Senators are allowed to yield for questions.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300083" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would just ask what the play is, if I can do that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kansas that the status of the majority here is that we would have no alternatives at all.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300083" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the one I would ask about, if I can ask a further question, is that of Senator Feingold. It seems to me, if we are going to have a full debate, all choices need to be considered, and the amendment offered by Senator Feingold should be considered and should be made in order. That has taken a lot of courage for him to offer such an amendment in a very forthright manner. I will say that I don't agree with it, but in discussions about the ramifications  of all of these resolutions, which are nonbinding and which I call confetti resolutions because they do not do anything except send very difficult messages to everybody, I think that ought to be made in order and that ought to be a choice.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would certainly agree with my friend from Kansas that it might be in order to have multiple amendments on the other side, but certainly that would be up to the other side to decide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just conclude before yielding the floor that the message here is clear: Senate Republicans are going to insist on being treated fairly. Secondly, I am hoping the majority leader and myself can structure an appropriate consent agreement so that we can consider this matter in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The majority leader is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wrote down the plaintive cries from my friends on the other side of the aisle: never seen the Senate work this way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, the distinguished senior Member of this body, Senator Byrd, who has a fine memory, we have memories. Now, there are 10 Senators  here who may not, but we remember, on a multitude of issues when we were in the minority, when we had no opportunity to debate anything or to offer amendments on anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the other words issued was "astonished." Mr. President, we are in the U.S. Senate. Anyone with any memory whatsoever understands how we were treated before, but when I became the majority leader, I said that I believed in the Golden Rule. I said I would treat people the way I want to be treated, that this is not any time to retaliate. In fact, I have followed the Golden Rule. We have had bills, such as the matter dealing with ethics or the matter dealing with minimum wage, and, of course,  the CR we just finished had input from both sides or it would not have passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would say this: We can go with the unanimous consent request I have propounded, and within a few hours, when that day ended, the 12 hours ended, we could be on whatever amendments they wanted to offer to the homeland security measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will go one step further than that. My friend from Arizona has suggested that he be allowed to offer his amendment. I would accept that, that we do the House-passed resolution and we do the McCain amendment and we spend 12 hours on those two matters the minute we get back here after this break, or if they want to do it tomorrow or Monday, I would agree to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my proposal, without a lot of fancy words here, Mr. President, is we would take up the House measure that is now before this body--it is going through the process and is at the desk--and also do the McCain amendment. Those two matters, those two resolutions, one opposing the surge and one in favor of the surge. No other amendments would be in order. We could do that. We can have a debate on that, and then still, just a matter of hours later, we can move to homeland security, and the people  who believed they had been left out of the debate could offer whatever amendments they wanted to on homeland security. That is my proposal.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, and I will object momentarily, once again the majority leader seeks to choose the Republican amendment. We were there last week when the majority leader indicated that he would agree to an amendment on each side but that he wanted to pick our amendment. So I am constrained to object on the basis that we on this side would choose, if we were to only have one resolution, what it would be. I, therefore, object.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, February 27, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed en bloc to the following concurrent resolutions under the following agreement: a concurrent resolution, if received from the House, the text of which is at the desk; <bill type="sc" number="7">S. Con. Res. 7</bill>, the Warner resolution which is to be discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee; McCain-Lieberman-Graham regarding benchmarks; and  Gregg related to funding.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that the request be modified to say that the amendments that would be in order would be the House measure to which we referred, where we are in favor of supporting the troops and against the surge, and the McCain amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say editorially, Mr. President, that is what the Senator from Arizona asked, and we will give it to him. We will have that debate, one in favor of the surge and one against the surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my friend to modify his request.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate has heard this song before. We heard it 2 weeks ago, and we have listened as seven or eight Members on the other side have come to the floor repeatedly day after day. They have sent letters and held press conferences saying they earnestly want us to move forward on this issue, though they voted against it. They voted against the motion for cloture that would have brought us to a debate on the issue, and it is on their own legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We offered them two Republican amendments, the Warner amendment and the McCain amendment, one opposing the surge and one supporting the surge. They wouldn't accept it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Regular order, Mr. President.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>When they did not accept this, a cloture motion was filed on a motion to proceed, and they voted against it. They have come back since saying they want the opportunity to debate. They can't have it both ways.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Regular order to proceed is called for. Under the previous order, the Senator from Pennsylvania is to be recognized for 10 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I had requested 10 minutes to speak on the judges, but I want to use a few moments here to talk about what is on the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have just seen the Senate, for the better part of an hour, with a majority of the Senators on the floor, demonstrate gridlock and paralysis. I have an observation to make--and perhaps it would be an admonition or a warning--that the Senate is about to become irrelevant. We have, on the other side of the Rotunda, the House of Representatives taking up the issue of Iraq, which all Members here, with the speeches just made, agree is the most pressing issue facing the country, but the Senate can't  address it. And the Senate can't address it because the majority leader has exercised his right under rule XV to fill the tree, which precludes any action by the Republicans, unless we Republicans exercise our right to withhold cloture.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, will the Senator yield?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I just want to interpose a point here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think I heard the Senator make reference to the majority leader having the right to fill the tree. No, he doesn't. He does not. He has the right if no other Senator seeks recognition. But once the majority makes a motion or sends an amendment to the desk, at that second he loses the floor until the Chair states its business, and while he has lost the floor, another Senator can seek recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I merely make the point the majority leader does not have "the right." No other Senator has "the right" to fill the tree. If other Senators do not intervene, then of course he will fill it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may regain the floor because I have a very limited time, my observations after being here for 26 years-plus are that when the majority leader then seeks recognition again, he gets it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>And when he makes the amendment in the first-degree and then he seeks recognition again, he gets it, an amendment in the second degree, and he does fill the tree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week I proposed to change the rule. This rule has been exercised by Senator Dole, Senator Mitchell, Senator Byrd, and all the majority leaders in the last two decades. I think it is time we change the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not going to change the rule now. But I do believe that the Senate is in real danger of becoming irrelevant. I don't think we ought to be dominant over the House of Representatives, but I think we ought to at least be equal.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the Senator yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>No; I wish to finish. I think we ought to at least be equal. What we have is that we are close to anarchy. We have been debating the debate all week. The House has rules which we wouldn't want, where the Rules Committee goes off and comes back and limits what the House of Representatives can do. Sometimes that is despotism, and between anarchy and despotism, it is a fairly tough choice. But right now, I am finding it difficult--impossible--to answer my constituents about what the  Senate is doing. I tell them the tree is filled. They think I am talking about an orchard. I tell them we are debating whether we are going to have a debate, and they can't understand what we are doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I counted the Senators on the floor during the exchange between the majority leader and the Republican leader. We had more than 50 Senators here sitting around on the debate for a debate without reaching a resolution. I think Senator McConnell is correct. I do not say that in the partisan sense, if I can attract the attention of the distinguished Republican leader. I think he is correct. But I repeat I do not say it in a partisan sense. There ought to be an accommodation and there ought  to be an agreement reached between the leaders. When you have the proposal to have a variety of resolutions, that is the way of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator McCain has been here for 20 years. Senator McConnell has been here for 22 years. I have been here for 26 years. Senator Byrd has been here for--I can't count that high--48 years, going onto 49. This is not the way the Senate ought to work. But it is the way the Senate has worked, with all the majority leaders in the last two decades exercising their right of recognition and filling the tree and tying up the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the Senate is finally caught. We are finally caught where America and the world sees what we are doing. It is a little ridiculous to have this kind of gridlock and this kind of paralysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much time do I have left, Mr. President? I have to talk about the judges.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding. I have this comment. First of all, I wish to congratulate the Senator. He is very observant. He is concerned about the Senate. He understands the rules. But while he understands the rules, we do not need any more rules. We have rules. Senators need to insist on their rights as Senators and they ought to speak up so they can be heard and they ought to pay attention. We don't need new rules. We have rules that have been here  for many years, and they have been tried and tried and tried again. We need to read the rules. Senators should read the rules and Senators should understand that they are Senators and they should be proud of that fact. We should demand that the rules be observed. I could do that. Every Senator can. We don't need new rules. We simply need to understand the rules we have. We need to insist on those rules, and the Chair ought as well to insist that the rules be observed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have not been here as long as my good friend from West Virginia, but I am the senior Member of this side. I cannot remember a time when we tied together the concept of filing a first-degree amendment, then a second-degree amendment, with cloture so it entirely shut off any participation by the minority. It has been stated here it has happened. I do not recall that. I do recall back in the days of the Clinton administration, Senator Byrd had a proposal, a  similar proposal, but we had a big ruckus. I am sure the Senator remembers. Senator Dole was our minority leader then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a defining moment for the Senate. Because as the Senator from Pennsylvania has indicated, if the majority of one can go to the House and negotiate a bill and bring it back and there are not going to be any amendments, we are going to file a first-degree amendment, a second-degree amendment, and have cloture or else--the Senate is totally irrelevant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having been in the minority and in the majority, I think the majority ought to think twice. There is only one vote difference here right now, two votes when our good friend from South Dakota comes back. But as a practical matter, the rights of the minority--really the whole country--depend upon the minority in the Senate having an opportunity to voice some of the concerns about what has happened in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say, in all sincerity, this is a defining moment. I believe the message we are trying to send on this Iraq resolution is wrong. I think it is harming the people who represent us in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even Afghanistan is coming back. We are going to have to send a new group, the 175th, over there to deal with al-Qaida in Afghanistan, again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our people need support, and we need to be able to articulate the reasons why we support them. If we follow the outline of the majority leader, we will not have that chance except by talking and talking. But no amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not right. It is not the Senate. I do not intend to stand by and see the  Senate lose its role under the Constitution to be the second House of the Congress. This is not a rubberstamp for the House. That is what we will be if we follow the intention of the majority leader now.</paragraph>
