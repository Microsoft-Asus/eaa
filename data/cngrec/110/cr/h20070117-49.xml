    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with my colleague from Texas. We must really approach violence, wherever it is, and I thank him for his words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, so many of us as Members have confronted families who have lost loved ones on the battlefields of Iraq. We realize that not one of those fallen soldiers would in any way step away from their duty. So today I rise to thank them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But because of their commitment to their Nation, I believe as policy makers we have a commitment to them, and it is imperative that this body and the other body not engage in nonbinding resolutions, when the American people have asked us to bring our troops home, when the President of the United States has not begun to consider alternatives such as political diplomacy, when there is no recognition that the Congress is an equal branch of government and can in fact cease the funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must have a new direction. We must have a safe and secure Iraq. We can work for both, but we must have the respect and mutuality of the three branches of government.</paragraph>
