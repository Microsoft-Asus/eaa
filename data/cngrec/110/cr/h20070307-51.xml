  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce two related bills. The first would create a Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail to commemorate the Chesapeake Bay Campaign of the War of 1812. The second bill I am introducing would create a national commission to plan and coordinate the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail would match some of the most important events of the War of 1812. The trail commemorating the only combined naval and land attack on the United States begins with June 1814 battles between the British Navy and the American Chesapeake flotilla in Saint Leonard's Creek in Calvert County and ends at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where our National Anthem was composed and the British met their ultimate defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Maryland is blessed with a multitude of historic and cultural attractions across the State. Fort McHenry is a classic example of this rich heritage and a centerpiece of the legislation I introduce today. Francis Scott Key best captured the essence of Fort McHenry in his poem written as a prisoner aboard a British frigate during the bombardment of the fort. The text of the poem later became our National Anthem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, my family has enjoyed Fort McHenry's history as well as its tremendous vistas of our beloved Chesapeake Bay. Just recently, I spent the morning there with my son, an avid birder and budding naturalist, exploring the wetland restoration area that abuts the fort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second bill I introduce today would create a Star Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission to plan and coordinate the bicentennial celebration of the War of 1812 and the composition of our National Anthem. The Commission would be made up of citizens from States that the National Park Service has determined to be the most historically significant, as well as National Park Service officials, historical experts and other individuals selected by congressional leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the bicentennial of the War of 1812 quickly approaching, we should move swiftly to approve this measure and enable the Commission to plan a suitable bicentennial celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the War of 1812 was a seminal moment in American history. Many refer to it as the "second war of independence." When the war began, our fragile experiment in democracy was still in its early stages, and the Nation found itself under attack from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Many wondered whether democracy could hold together through the trials of war. The War of 1812 proved that liberty and security are not mutually exclusive conditions and set the stage for  the spread of democracy around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just this morning I met with War of 1812 experts and historic preservationists from throughout the State of Maryland at Fort McHenry. For years, these individuals have been dedicated advocates for creating the Star Spangled Banner Trail and Bicentennial Commission. This legislation represents a culmination of their interests and hard work. I am very proud to be introducing it today, and I hope my colleagues will join with me to pass both bills during this Congress.</paragraph>
