    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor June James of Hazel, SD. June was chosen as the 2007 Spirit of South Dakota Award winner. This impressive award reflects June's vision, courage, and strength of character in the development of her family, community, and State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June is a lifelong South Dakotan who reflects the values and traditions that make our State great. She is dedicated  to her family and the Hazel community. She has demonstrated this dedication through her involvement in her church, her work as an extension coordinator in Codington County and Hamlin County, and her service to the local 4H chapter. In addition to all this, June and her husband run the family's century farm. Clearly June reflects the qualities  that make her deserving of this year's 2007 Spirit of South Dakota award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to honor June James, along with her friends and family, in celebrating her 50 years of selfless dedication and service to the city of Hazel.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
