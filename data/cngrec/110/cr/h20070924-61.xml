  <narrative>ESCALATION IN IRAQ WAR COSTS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10739]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to draw attention to the surge, or escalation, of the occupation of Iraq. This time it is not an escalation of troops; it is the escalation in spending to continue this senseless, apparently endless occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent estimates put the cost of the military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan at $808 billion by the end of this year. That's just knocking on the door of $1 trillion, Mr. Speaker. Let me say that again: we are closing in on $1 trillion, and we haven't even begun to put together a plan to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration has talked about a Korean- or Vietnam-like presence in Iraq. This could mean as much as 50 more years of U.S. boots on the ground. Conservative estimates put just one more decade of military spending at $1.5 trillion. Who knows what it will be after 20 or 30 or 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has an obligation, both moral and political, to help the people of Iraq to rebuild their nation. Whether through reconciliation or reconstruction, our commitment must be ongoing. But we can't start either of these while we are funding this administration's occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the bravery of our men and women in uniform, we all know that we can't bring peace and stability to another country down the barrel of a gun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent report by the Congressional Progressive Caucus found that this misdirection of funds may actually be endangering our own homeland. Each of my colleagues can go to my Web site, www.Woolsey.house.gov, and find out what it is costing their congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district of Marin and Sonoma counties in California have already paid $1.3 billion for the occupation of Iraq. That could have paid for nearly 25,000 public safety officers or nearly 18,000 port container inspectors to provide real security for our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of passing on a war deficit to our children and grandchildren, we could have been investing in their future and, Mr. Speaker, we must. So far in paying for the occupation, we could have paid for 20,000 more elementary school teachers, or we could have provided almost 500,000 more children with health care, or 200,000 college scholarships to worthy students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's working families have demanded, they went to the polls in November, they want us to end this occupation. They want real investment in their own communities. They want this Congress to stand up to the White House and demand that our troops and military contractors be brought home, not in 10 years, not in 50 years. They want our troops home in a safe and orderly responsible manner by the holidays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enough of the endless occupation. Enough of the misspent billions. Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. Let's bring the troops home. Let's provide for a secure future for American and Iraqi families.</paragraph>
