    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the national champions from Lewis Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the LCSC Warriors won the 52nd annual National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics championship World Series baseball game. It was LCSC's third straight win, and 16th since 1982, all under the leadership of Coach Ed Cheff. Lewis Clark State College can be proud of these men for an extraordinary win and the national recognition they are once again receiving. In fact, I was proud to recognize the fine athletes at LCSC by wearing their red, white, and blue uniform during the congressional  baseball game last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, naturally I believe Idaho produces the best of everything. The best agriculture, the best companies, the best people, and, indeed, the best baseball players, originate in Idaho, and last week's win just proves the point. My congratulations to the Warriors, LCSC, and Lewiston, Idaho.</paragraph>
