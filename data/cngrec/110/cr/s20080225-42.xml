  <chair> The clerk will report the bills by title.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>A bill (<bill type="s" number="2663">S. 2663</bill>) to reform the Consumer Product Safety Commission to provide greater protection for children's products, to improve the effectiveness of consumer product recall programs, and for other purposes.</chair>
  <chair>A bill (<bill type="s" number="2664">S. 2664</bill>) to extend the provisions of the Protect America Act of 2007.</chair>
  <chair>A bill (<bill type="s" number="2665">S. 2665</bill>) to extend the provisions of the Protect America Act of 2007 until July 1, 2009.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I now ask for the second reading en bloc and object to my own request en bloc.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would say that <bill type="s" number="2663">S. 2663</bill> is a bipartisan piece of legislation, the Consumer Product Safety Act. We have been working for months to get this going. It is my understanding now that Senators PRYOR and STEVENS asked that this matter move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other matter related to the FISA bill, we are trying to work something out with the House, and hopefully we can get something done on that soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, tonight I am introducing and beginning the rule XIV process on two bills related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. One bill would extend the Protect America Act, the PAA, for 30 days, while the other would extend that law until July 1, 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year I introduced <bill type="s" number="2556">S. 2556</bill> which would have extended the PAA for 30 days, and <bill type="s" number="2257">S. 2257</bill>, which would have extended the PAA until July 1, 2009. The bills I am introducing tonight would extend the PAA for the same periods of time, but they are drafted to take account of the fact that the PAA has expired. In addition, they contain a post hoc effective date that is intended to eliminate any potentially adverse legal effect resulting from the expiration of the PAA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My purpose in introducing bills with two different extension lengths is to demonstrate once again that I am willing to extend the PAA for as long a time, or as short a time, as is needed to finalize a strong final bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that the House and Senate have both passed bills--H.R. 3773 and <bill type="s" number="2248">S. 2248</bill>--to strengthen the PAA, the right way to get to a final bill is through bipartisan negotiations. Unfortunately, my Republican friends appear unwilling to negotiate. We convened two negotiating sessions last week, but Republican staff members and administration lawyers declined to attend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, President Bush says that the expiration of the Protect America Act has made America less safe, but he threatened to veto a bill extending that law while negotiators work on a final bill. The President's position is inexplicable and reckless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line for Senate Democrats is clear: We want to give our intelligence professionals all needed tools while protecting the privacy of law-abiding Americans. We are willing to extend the Protect America Act for as long as it takes to get a final bill.</paragraph>
