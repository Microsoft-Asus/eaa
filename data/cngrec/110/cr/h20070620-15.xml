    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats are looking to fund $190 billion in spending projects. However, they don't have $190 billion. So the Democrats seem to be disguising the truth from the American people by playing hide and seek. They are hiding $190 billion by claiming it's in a reserve fund. But there isn't any reserve fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So where will $190 billion come from? Well, the Democrats have voted to terminate the Republican tax cuts of 2001 through 2003. The money will come from the American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As much as I strongly disagree with tax increases, the least the Democrats can do is to level with the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than playing hide and seek, the Democrats should have the political courage to admit that they are  taxing and spending. The American people deserve to know the truth. After all, it's their money.</paragraph>
