  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="RECOGNIZING MAURICE A. CALDERON">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a longtime community leader in Inland Southern California, Maurice A. Calderon, as he retires from a long career of service and support to his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maurice Calderon as a board member for Banning Unified School District, as a trustee with the San Jacinto Community College District, and as a trustee for the San Bernardino Valley College Foundation. Mr. Calderon has also served as a member of the foundation for the University of California, Riverside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maurice Calderon has also served his community through involvement in a number of community organizations. He is a member of the Inland Empire Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Inland Empire African American Chamber of Commerce. He has served as the director of the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, and as chairman of the Inland Empire Hispanic Leadership Council. Maurice is also the president of Sinfonia Mexicana, a Hispanic symphony that provides cultural enrichment throughout the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his longstanding work throughout various communities, Maurice Calderon has been the recipient of numerous titles of distinction and awards of commendation. He has been named the "Father of the Year" and the "Citizen of the Year" by the cities of Banning and Beaumont, respectively. Hispanic Lifestyle Magazine and the Inland Empire Hispanic Chamber of Commerce named him the "Hispanic of the Year," and he was named to the Southern California Native American and Latino Hall of Fame. In  April 2004, he was honored as the recipient of the Reconocimiento Ohtli Award, which is given by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs to role models who have successfully contributed to the well-being of their communities. And in 2005, the city of Banning acknowledged Maurice and the entire Calderon family for their more than 100 years of community service, and named a street in their honor, "Calderon Way."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Calderon retires, he can look back on a distinguished career of service to his community, to education, and to cultural awareness. I join with members of his community in wishing him a wonderful retirement.</paragraph>
