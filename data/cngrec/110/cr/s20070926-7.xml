    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is disheartening news coming out of Burma this morning. Last night, following yet another day of massive peaceful protests demanding political reform in Burma, the repressive Burmese regime imposed a nighttime curfew and banned all public gatherings of more than five people. Despite this brazen effort to muzzle freedom of expression, reports indicate that thousands of Buddhist monks and other protestors courageously defied the prohibition on public  assembly and marched again in Rangoon. In response, reports indicate that the security forces of the State Peace and Development Council responded with typical brutality, beating and arresting scores of these brave protestors. It was reported that one person was shot to death and five received gunshot injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 1988, the regime responded to similar peaceful protests by massacring thousands of its own citizens. But the Burmese regime should know that things have changed in the intervening years. Modern technology has permitted photographs of those heroic protesters to be transmitted via the Internet around the entire world. Whereas before the news could be easily muzzled by the junta, today that is no longer the case. The world is watching, and any brutal steps taken in Rangoon are instantly  made known in places such as New York, New Delhi, and Beijing. These moving images of heroism have certainly reached us here in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have said before to the regime in Burma, we are watching you. To the people of Burma, we stand with you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, would the Republican leader yield for a question?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to ask a question based on the Senator's statement. First, I commend the Republican leader for his statement on the situation in Burma. It is my understanding now that we anticipate this military junta is likely to engage in repressive tactics against the Buddhist monks and the people of this country. I thank the leader for his statements because I think they validate our mutual concern that first an  election, which came up with a good result,  finally be implemented so the people of Burma have a representative government and that those political dissidents--most notably, Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi--be released from house arrest. She has suffered enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator for bringing this up to the floor. I want him to know his sentiments are felt on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I may just add, my friend from Illinois is absolutely correct. This is a regime which I have been following for a long time, having introduced the first Burma sanctions bill some 4 to 5 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is absolutely right. They engaged in this kind of activity back in 1988, killed a significant number of Burmese citizens simply seeking to have an opportunity to express themselves, which they subsequently did in the 1990 election, which Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy won overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, after which she was placed under house arrest and has been there  virtually the entire time since then, since 1990. She was under house arrest while her husband passed away in London.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a pariah regime. Had they had nuclear weapons, I think the rest of the world would have been a lot more interested in this regime, as we have been, for example, in North Korea and in Iran. But they are now revealing their true colors once again. Technology is much better today than it was back in 1988. They will not be able to engage in these kinds of abuses with no one noticing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my friend from Illinois for making clear that all of us here in the Senate, regardless of party affiliation, condemn this behavior and look forward to the day when the election of 1990 is finally honored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
