    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, President Bush will deliver his State of the Union Address tonight. The American people have been very clear in what they want. They want a change in the tone, they want a change in direction in Iraq, and they want our national priorities to focus on helping families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President should use this opportunity to answer some questions. I know my constituents would like to hear three things from the State of the Union: One, how is the President going to work with Congress to really fix this country's broken health care system; two, how is the President going to bring our troops home swiftly and safely; and, three, when is the President really going to return to the domestic priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratically controlled House and Senate are ready for him to change his agenda, change his tone and get to the people's agenda. So tonight we hear from our President.</paragraph>
