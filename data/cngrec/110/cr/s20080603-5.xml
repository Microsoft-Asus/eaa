  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - June 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4901">S4901</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today following my remarks and those of Senator McConnell, there will be a period of morning business until 11 a.m., or when the hour is gone, with the time equally divided and controlled. The Republicans will control the first half--I see Senator Cornyn, ready to begin--the majority will control the second half of morning business. Then we will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3036">S. 3036</bill>, the Climate Security Act. The Senate will recess  at 12:30, as we do every Tuesday, for our weekly caucus luncheons, and will reconvene following the official Senate photograph which is scheduled for today at 2:15.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope all Senators will make themselves available for the photograph. It takes weeks for the staff to set up to take these pictures. If you look around, you can see in the galleries the lighting. It is very difficult to get the lighting down here to take all 100 Senators. So I hope everyone will be here at 2:15 and be thoughtful and considerate to their colleagues so the staff can get the picture taken as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
