    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Act. By cultivating the Nation's next generation of skilled scientists and researchers who are in the early stages of their careers, the House-passed plan will better ensure that our Nation educates the best and the brightest young people to be scientists and engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I firmly believe that leadership and innovation is absolutely necessary for the United States to maintain its competitive advantage in the increasingly global marketplace. My own home district in southeastern Pennsylvania is a leader in the field of biotechnology. I have seen the economic and social benefits of innovation and technology in science and engineering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Science, research and biotechnology industries attract highly skilled workers and offer them good wages and benefits. These innovators and the businesses they are creating in my home district make us competitive in this global marketplace. Most importantly, they are developing new treatments, medicines, vaccines, that are improving the quality of life for people around the world. As the sister of a dedicated scientist and the mother of a young medical researcher, I recognize the need to support  the work of highly skilled scientists whose work is on the cutting edge of research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the "Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act" will help ensure that we encourage and train highly skilled scientists in Pennsylvania and across the Nation. I am proud to have supported its passage.</paragraph>
