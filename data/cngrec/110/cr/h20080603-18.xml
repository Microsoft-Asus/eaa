    <bill type="hc" number="138">H. Con. Res. 138</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas despite the advances in medical technology and research, men continue to live an average of almost 6 years less than women and African-American men have the lowest life expectancy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas all 10 of the 10 leading causes of death, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, affect men at a higher percentage than women;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas between ages 45-54, men are 3 times more likely than women to die of heart attacks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas men die of heart disease at almost twice the rate of women;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas men die of cancer at almost one and a half times the rate of women;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in men aged 15-34, and when detected early, has a 95 percent survival rate;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the number of cases of colon cancer among men will reach over 55,000 in 2007, and almost half will die from the disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the likelihood that a man will develop prostate cancer is 1 in 6;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the number of men contracting prostate cancer will reach over 218,890 in 2007, and almost 27,050 will die from the disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas African-American men in the United States have the highest incidence in the world of prostate cancer;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas significant numbers of male-related health problems, such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, infertility, and colon cancer, could be detected and treated if men's awareness of these problems was more pervasive;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas more than one-half the elderly widows now living in poverty were not poor before the death of their husbands, and by age 100 women outnumber men 8 to 1;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas educating both the public and health care providers about the importance of early detection of male health problems will result in reducing rates of mortality for these diseases;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas appropriate use of tests such as Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) exams, blood pressure screens, and cholesterol screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self-testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result in the detection of many of these problems in their early stages and increases in the survival rates to nearly 100 percent;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas women are 100 percent more likely to visit the doctor for annual examinations and preventive services than men;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas men are less likely than women to visit their health center or physician for regular screening examinations of male-related problems for a variety of reasons, including fear, lack of health insurance, lack of information, and cost factors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas National Men's Health Week was established by Congress and first celebrated in 1994 and urged men and their families to engage in appropriate health behaviors, and the resulting increased awareness has improved health-related education and helped prevent illness;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Governors of over 45 States issue proclamations annually declaring Men's Health Week in their States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas since 1994, National Men's Health Week has been celebrated each June by dozens of States, cities, localities, public health departments, health care entities, churches, and community organizations throughout the Nation, that promote health awareness events focused on men and family;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the National Men's Health Week website has been established at www.menshealthweek.org and features Governors' proclamations and National Men's Health Week events;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas men who are educated about the value that preventive health can play in prolonging their lifespan and their role as productive family members will be more likely to participate in health screenings;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas men and their families are encouraged to increase their awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, and medical checkups; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas June 9 through 15, 2008, is National Men's Health Week, which has the purpose of heightening the awareness of preventable health problems and encouraging early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="hc" number="138">H. Con. Res. 138</bill>, as amended, which expresses Congress's support of Men's Health Week, which is designed to raise awareness of men's health issues and the importance of preventative health care in order to improve the lifespan of American men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="138">H. Con. Res. 138</bill>, which was introduced by the gentleman from Maryland, Representative ELIJAH CUMMINGS, on May 1, 2007, was amended and reported from the Oversight Committee on May 15, 2008, before being passed by voice vote. The measure has the support and sponsorship of 59 Members of Congress, and expresses support for increased medical awareness that will  improve the health and well-being of American men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all of the 10 leading causes of death among Americans, such as cancer and heart disease, affect our Nation's men at a higher rate than our women. On average, the male life expectancy in America is 6 years lower than the life expectancy of their female counterparts. A leading cause of this disparity is that men are 100 percent less likely to visit a doctor for screening and preventative medical checkups. This reluctance is tragic, as  many life-threatening conditions are mitigated when found through early detection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress recognized the need to encourage preventative medicine by increasing health awareness in American men when it established National Men's Health Week in 1994. Now, 14 years later, this commemorative week has helped to raise awareness and lower illness among American men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of this measure, as it will continue to encourage the men of our country to take a more active and preventative role in safeguarding their health, and, therefore, the health of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of this resolution promoting National Men's Health Week. Across this Nation, men are reminded daily about the benefits of living a healthy life. Whether through exercise, a balanced diet, or regular visits to the doctor, these simple steps can lead to longer, more vibrant lives. Sadly, many men still neglect the basic preventative measures and often fail to realize the ripple effect their declining health can have on those around them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that men have a shorter lifespan than women. Of the 10 leading causes of death in this country, men lead women in all 10. Yes, some of this can be attributed to lifestyle differences. Men are prone to engage in heavier drinking, smoking, and risky behaviors. But the sad reality is that men all too often neglect to seek out the medical help they need. Studies have shown that men are significantly less likely to visit the doctor than women are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress and the President established National Men's Health Awareness Week in May 1994. They chose the week leading up to Father's Day, when our focus on the male figures in our life is greatest, to bring national attention to the critical health issues facing men and to highlight the preventative measures that are necessary and available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early detection is vital, and in many cases, increases chances for survival. Men's Health Awareness Week helps bring this information to light and highlights the proactive steps that men can take to improve their chances for a long, healthy life. The benefits of a more proactive approach to men's health extends not only to the individual, but to their families, friends, society, and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Better long-term health means fewer medical expenses for families, taxpayers, and employers. When women outlive their spouses, often by more than half a decade, they face the financial, emotional, and physical burden of living out their remaining years in solitude. This can ultimately place undue stress on a family or taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Men's Health Awareness Week helps broaden our understanding of the serious health risks facing men and the simple steps we can all take to help mitigate their effects. So I urge my colleagues not only to support this resolution, but to honor its message. If you're a man, go to the doctor. If you're a woman, encourage your husband, brother, son, and friends to do so. Take a walk, go for a jog, or eat a piece of fruit. After all, we all know that an apple a day keeps the doctor away.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="138">H. Con. Res. 138</bill>, supporting National Men's Health Week. Not only should we be recognizing this important health issue this week, but Congress should also be addressing other issues critical to the American people, especially rising fuel prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans across this country pay an average of $3.98 per gallon, these prices hit families, and particularly school children. Just yesterday, the Calhoun Times reported in Georgia that, and I quote, "High gas prices hit high school sports. With gas prices soaring to record heights, the cost of taking teams on the road has become a looming storm on the horizon of high school athletics that has led some to worry what the future may have in store. All across the country, people are dealing  with the pinch of high gas prices. With high school teams' main mode of transportation still the average school bus, which runs on diesel, costs are even higher."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. We need to act now to lower gas prices.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we observe and promote Men's Health Week, I am pleased to note that both the Illinois Department of Public Health and the City of Chicago's Department of Public Health, under able leadership of their commissioners, place great emphasis on men's health, and have two activities coming up this week; Saturday at Malcolm X College, and next week, the day before Father's Day, at Malcolm X Community College, where the focus is men's health.</paragraph>
