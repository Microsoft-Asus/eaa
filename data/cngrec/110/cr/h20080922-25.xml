    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3336">H.R. 3336</bill> was introduced by our colleague from Colorado, Representative DOUG LAMBORN. The bill directs the National Park Service to study how best to preserve Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Camp Hale operated from 1942 to 1965 as a winter and a high-altitude training venue for the 10th Mountain Division and other elements of the U.S. Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 250,000-acre camp was also used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a secret center for training Tibetan refugees in guerilla warfare to resist the Chinese occupation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lands were returned to the Forest Service in 1966. Today, the camp is part of the White River and San Isabel National Forest. Camp Hale was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Congressman Lamborn for initiating this National Park Service study of Camp Hale so Americans can appreciate the events that occurred during World War II and the Cold War because people forget about the Cold War. A lot of activity went on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Tennessee Pass and Camp Hale served as the training site for the 10th Mountain Division, a specialized skiing unit whose heroism during World War II inspired our Nation. Later the site was used for covert training operations furthering the cause of freedom during the Cold War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colorado today benefits from the ski area and the educational opportunities presented by this unique landmark. Listing Tennessee Pass and Camp Hale as a unit of the National Park Service will allow us to learn about and experience this unique piece of history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3336">H.R. 3336</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>The title was amended so as to read: "A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to carry out a study to determine the suitability and feasibility of establishing Camp Hale as a unit of the National Park System.".</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
