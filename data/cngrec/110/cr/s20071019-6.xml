  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - October 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13137">S13137</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, following any remarks that I or Senator McConnell make, the Senate will immediately go to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Last night, an agreement was made to provide for the filing of all first-degree amendments by 1 p.m. today. Additionally, there is a commitment to complete action on this bill by noon on Tuesday--by 12:30, I should say, on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be no rollcall votes today, but I do expect a number of Members to offer amendments during today's session. It is my understanding this morning Senator Coburn and Senator Brown will offer amendments. Votes will occur Monday evening at around 5:30 p.m., and there could be a long series of votes Monday night. I will have more to say about the schedule later today.</paragraph>
