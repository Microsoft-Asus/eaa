  <narrative>HIGH COST OF ENERGY -- (Senate - June 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4908">S4908</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wanted Sara Sanders to come over here and be on the floor while I am speaking, because this photograph is of her hometown, Madison, FL, in Madison County, which is in north Florida. If you examine this photograph of downtown Madison, here is the old courthouse, and across U.S. 90 is this Shell gasoline station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This photograph is from a couple of days ago, and you can see that regular is $4.09.9 a gallon, and premium is $4.33.9 a gallon. This is certainly a record for Florida, and it is especially a record for the rural parts of Florida, which Madison County, part of north Florida, is a part of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, when we were in recess, I did 18 townhall meetings all over the State of Florida, and I can tell you our people are hurting. They are hurting because they are having difficulty making financial ends meet. Our people are hurting and are having difficulty making their paycheck go far enough. Our people, particularly those who have to drive long distances and don't have any alternative of mass transit to get to work, are having difficulty being able to afford getting to work. That is  symbolized by this photograph of a couple of days ago in Madison, FL--$4.10 for a gallon of regular gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where is it going to go? Well, I wish to have you look at this particular chart. Now, this indicates to us what has happened to the price of gas over the last 8 years. In January of 2001, the price of gas was at $1.47. Seven and one-half years later, the price at the end of May was $3.94 a gallon. This is a national average. As that photograph reflected, it has exceeded, even in rural parts of America, $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It rocked along here at less than $1.50 for a couple of years. Then, in 2003, it jumped above $1.50 and started to gradually climb. Then, in 2005, it spiked up right after Katrina. As a matter of fact, overnight, when Katrina hit, it went from about $2.65 to up over $3. It gyrated back and forth, exceeding that $3 limit, and look what has happened in the last month or 2 months. It has gone from less than $3 a gallon all the way up to $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is something that is going on, and people are sick and tired because they are frustrated they can't afford this. By the way, Florida is a microcosm of America. A lot of America has moved to Florida and, therefore, when you look at a representative sampling of this country, our State is a microcosm. And having been all over the State for all of these townhall meetings this past week, I can tell you that people's frustrations are turning to anger. They do not know what to do, but they want  their Government to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what do we do? Well, I must say it is very interesting that we hear coming from parts of the energy sector the same old story: We have to drill more. If you could drill more and you could get it to market immediately, that would certainly bring some relief. But when that is said, the full story isn't told. Because when the oil companies say they want to drill more, and that supply and demand will take care of the problem, what they fail to say--and they fail purposely to say this--is that  there are 33 million acres under lease that are submerged lands--33 million acres--of which they haven't drilled. It is there. They have not drilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, a side issue here is the constant pressure to come in and drill off of our coast, off of the east coast of the United States and off of the west coast. But there are 33 million acres under lease, submerged, that are already available. Plus, there are another 34 million acres that are either owned or leased on lands that have not been drilled. Now, you don't hear that, but that is a fact. Of those 33 million acres that are submerged, and that are under lease and ready to be drilled,  or to go through the process of leasing, they ignore the fact that we worked out a compromise 2 or 3 years ago where we would add an additional 8.3 million acres of submerged lands in the Gulf of Mexico that could be leased. We kept that away from the military training area, which is most of the Gulf of Mexico off of the State of Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All that submerged land is there for drilling, but of course we hear the same old refrain from over the years: Well, let's drill. Let's drill our way out of the problem. The fact is that is a red herring to get us off of the ultimate solution to this problem. The answer is not just drill, the answer is alternative energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me put it another way. The United States has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, but the United States consumes 25 percent of the world's oil production. If you only have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves but you are consuming every day 25 percent of the world's oil production, doesn't that suggest to you that you can't drill your way out of the problem; that you ought to be looking to different solutions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to suggest a few. But first I want to go back in history. What has happened in America? First, we had a wake-up call. Remember, it was back in the early 1970s. The OPEC cartel was formed and they decided to have an oil embargo, and so the price of oil jumped per barrel something like from the $2 or $3 a barrel price to suddenly $10 and  a little more, and the long gas lines occurred. There was world oil panic and we vowed we were going to do  something about it. As a matter of fact, the President of the United States at the time said, We are going to make ourselves energy independent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, here we are, 3 1/2  decades later, and it is not the United States that is energy independent, it is Brazil that is energy independent. In those early 1970s, after that scare, when we vowed we were going to do something about it, we went back to sleep. Then in the late 1970s, we had another wake-up call. This wake-up call was the Iranian hostage crisis. Remember how the oil markets got jittery and we started having the long lines at the gas stations again, and we said, We are going to do  something about this energy independence on foreign oil? Then what happened? We collectively, as a nation, went back to sleep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cheap oil was part of the problem. It seduced us, even though that cheap oil was continuing to get a little more expensive. So, then, we get up to the end of the decade of the 1980s and Saddam Hussein suddenly moves on Kuwait and takes over another country and their oil fields. We had another crisis and oil spikes again. The Nation was in an energy crisis. Our foreign oil supplies were being threatened, and we make another vow that we are going to do something about it. And what happens? We allow  ourselves to be lulled by the sweet dulcet tones of being reliant on a cheap energy source, even though it was getting higher and higher, and we go back to sleep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we turn the century. Suddenly, we have September 11. Then we have Afghanistan. Then we have the Iraq war. All of those oil supplies in that region of the world are threatened and, suddenly, everyone is getting jittery. At the same time, China is emerging as an industrial power, and so is India. They are demanding more and more of the world's oil supplies and the supplies are getting tighter and tighter and the price starts going up and up. Still, on the Senate floor with my colleague, the  senior Senator from California, as I have assisted her for the last 8 years, each year trying to increase miles per gallon in the fleet average of our automobiles, we are not able to get the votes to pass it. We allow ourselves to be lulled and lulled back to sleep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, because of the way this gas price spiked after Katrina to over $3, finally we were able to marshal the political will so that we could change the miles per gallon, a modest change, to 35 miles per gallon from 25 miles per gallon--although that 25-miles-per-gallon standard set in the 1980s was illusory because light trucks and SUVs were exempt. We were able to get to a new standard to include all and a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon--but it would not be fully phased in, over the  period of the next 12 years, until the date of 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I offer some additional solutions, why has oil, as measured in gas prices, gone, in just a few months, from $3 a gallon to over $4 a gallon?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is the President indicating that I do not have any further time, Mr. President? Is the Presiding Officer indicating I do not have any further time?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> No. The Senator has spoken for 15 minutes. I was consulting with the Parliamentarian to see if there were limits. There were none.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>That was my understanding. Mr. President, does the Senator from California want to speak?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Through the Chair to the Senator from Florida, I am the first speaker on the global warming bill. Do what you need to do. I thank the Senator.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am having a good time doing it, too. I will wrap up within the next 5 or so minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why, then, other than what we have already talked about--the tightness of the world's oil market--why, in just the last couple of months, has it spiked from $3 a gallon to over $4 a gallon? Why, in Madison, FL, a rural part of Florida, 2 days ago, was regular gas at $4.10?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of that reason, of course, is what we have talked about, the world tightness. Part of it is that the United States relies on oil from foreign shores for 60 percent of its daily consumption of oil from places such as the Persian Gulf and Nigeria and Venezuela--the Persian Gulf, roughly 20 percent of our oil supply; Nigeria, 12 percent of our daily supply; Venezuela, 14 percent of our daily supply. I have just mentioned three very unstable parts of the world. That is part of the skittishness  of this world oil market. But there have to be additional reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How about the weakness of the dollar? You know what we could do about that? Here is a solution. We could start bringing our budget back into balance instead of going out where spending is here but revenues are only here and the difference each year we have to borrow. Guess whom we are borrowing from--China and Japan. They are buying our debt in order for us to meet our expenditures. If we bring that budget back into balance, we can start strengthening our dollar, which will help us in this overall  global market of oil since oil is sold in U.S. dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think the biggest part of this spike is that we have world oil markets that are buying futures contracts, and the speculators are speculating up the price as they bid up the price, and they are not having to put down a substantial amount of money. They are only putting down about 6 percent of the total oil contract, so 94 percent they are basically getting on future credit, and that means they can bid up that price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, Are we going to get in and start checking out these commodities exchanges? Are we going to get a Commodity Futures Trading Commission that will crack the whip, that will examine this speculation driving up the price?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed a part 2 weeks ago in the farm bill that is now law that will close that Enron loophole that occurred in the year 2000, that exempted Enron and others from oversight in the trading markets for energy. That certainly has allowed that speculation to go on. We got a little victory there, on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is, if we are going to solve this problem we have to have the political will. This Senator will be speaking about the Lieberman-Warner bill later on, but there is all kinds of inflammatory rhetoric about how this is going to jack up the price of gasoline and of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fundamental problem is we have to have the political will to start going to alternative sources in order to break the stranglehold of dependence on oil and particularly foreign oil. That means we are going to have to go to alternative sources such as biofuels. We are going to have to pour the money into research and development on cellulosic ethanol. Ethanol, of course, we can mix in our existing cars with gasoline, and that yields much less consumption of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the new vehicles, the new cars, you can take 85 percent of ethanol and mix it with 15 percent of gasoline. Just think how much less is the use of oil. Or you put all of that mixture--85 ethanol, 15 gasoline--into a hybrid, and what about a plug-in hybrid? Suddenly you have expanded your equivalent miles per gallon of oil consumed to upwards of several hundreds of miles. We have the technology to do this. The question is, Do we have the political will? That is what I bring us back around to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a lot of inflammatory rhetoric about how, if you try this new thing or you try that new thing--don't do it. Go back on the old, reliable oil. I have seen frustration grow into anger out there as I faced my constituents and tried to give them hope this past week in those 18 townhall meetings. They need hope. We need to help provide that hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next President of the United States needs to help provide that hope. I want to be a part of that solution, to provide that hope. This Senator is going to continue to speak out against those voices that would say: No, no, just do it the same old way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for change. It is time for bold ideas. It is time for research and development. It is time to take the competitive genius of America, this Yankee ingenuity, our ability to create, our ability in our technological prowess--it is time to utilize all of those assets and to break through to a new beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> There is 7 minutes remaining in  morning business. The Senator from California.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I may, it is my understanding there is an agreement that I would be the first speaker on global warming. I have about 21 minutes. I could use 7 of them now. If the Senator from Oklahoma--I see him on the Senate floor--if he would prefer some time in morning business, I am prepared to yield to him, and then if I could be recognized as soon as we go to the bill?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think we are working on a unanimous consent request right now. Why don't you go ahead and use the remaining time in morning business, and then you will be the first speaker to use the remaining of that 21 minutes or whatever you want, and that 14 minutes will come out of the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to yield back the morning business time so we can go to the bill and I will be able to speak without interruption.</paragraph>
