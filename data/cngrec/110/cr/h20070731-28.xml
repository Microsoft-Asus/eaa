    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an outstanding program in my congressional district, the Sixth District of Illinois. It is the Mayor for a Day Essay Contest hosted and sponsored by the Character Counts in Elmhurst Coalition in Elmhurst, Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's winner, a winner from among 1,000 entries of first through eighth graders, is Katie Knopf. When asked the question, what should a person living in Elmhurst do and what should their responsibility be, she said to work as much as she possibly can on her schoolwork, to do volunteer work to contribute to the community. "It is my responsibility," she said, "to set a good example for the younger children in my neighborhood. All in all, I need to be a good and caring person."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Katie. Well done. Good advice for us all.</paragraph>
