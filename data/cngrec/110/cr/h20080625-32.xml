    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with two former oil executives in the White House, is it any wonder why gas prices are at a record high? President Bush's energy policy, created in secret by Vice President Cheney and by Big Oil, leaves us dangerously dependent on foreign oil, and it hurts our economy and American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington Republicans only offer more drilling, even though 68 million acres of Federal oil reserves are already open and leased for development. New drilling won't lower prices for years to come. In fact, drilling in the pristine Alaskan Wildlife Refuge wouldn't yield oil for 10 years, and in 22 years, it would only save consumers about 2 cents a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if congressional Republicans really are interested in helping consumers at the pump today, they will join us this week in passing legislation that forces Big Oil to either drill  where they already have leases or to lose those leases. It's time Big Oil uses it or loses it.</paragraph>
