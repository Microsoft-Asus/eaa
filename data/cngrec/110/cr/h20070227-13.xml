  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Promoting Transparency in Financial Reporting Act is a bipartisan bill that the House considered last year and passed on a voice vote. The legislation, however, failed to become law during the 109th Congress; and as a result, we now must consider these matters anew in the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> has a simple premise, Mr. Speaker. For the next 5 years, it would require annual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee by those entities most involved in establishing and implementing our Nation's financial reporting system. These parties include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the 1930s, the Securities and Exchange Commission has required public companies to file financial reports like income statements and balance sheets. Today, companies also rely on the generally accepted accounting principles developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to prepare these reporting documents. This independent accounting standard-setter came into existence in the 1970s. The tidal wave of accounting scandals at the start of this decade led Congress to reassess our Nation's  financial reporting system and adopt further reforms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Among other things, this landmark law created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. This body establishes the auditing standards used to examine public company accounting statements. It also registers and inspects the auditors of public companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even without this legislation, the Financial Services Committee is already working to examine accounting and auditing issues and the work of each of these parties. Earlier this month we approved an oversight plan for the 110th Congress. Several of the action items in that plan address accounting issues. For example, the oversight plan calls for the committee to review the efforts of the Financial Accounting Standards Board to improve financial accounting standards. It also calls for us to study  the progress being made on establishing international accounting standards. The plan further calls for the committee to examine the work of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as it implements the auditing improvements made by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This legislation, therefore, builds on what we had already planned to do in the 110th Congress and what other sessions of Congress should plan to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These proposed annual hearings over the next 5 years will help us to reassess complex accounting standards. It will help us improve the understandability of financial statements, and it will encourage the acceptance of interactive data. Even though it seems highly likely that the parties subject to this legislation would testify before the Financial Services Committee on these matters if asked, this bill will make certain that the committee remains focused on these important issues in the immediate  future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the adoption of <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> will help to encourage our regulators and standard-setters to fulfill their own roles and initiatives to achieve greater transparency, promote greater uniformity, and reduce complexity in financial reporting not only at home but also around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent years, our financial reporting standards have become more and more complex and complicated, especially as we have sought to address more difficult issues like the accounting treatment of derivatives and hedging instruments. This complexity has created difficulties not only for the companies that operate in the United States or that access our capital markets but also the investors and advisers who read and use financial statements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For our Nation to remain competitive, we need to have robust capital markets. For our capital markets to be strong, we need to have transparent, clear, and understandable financial reporting. We also need to ensure that the entities responsible for accounting and auditing issues continue to work smoothly together. <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> will help us to stay focused on achieving these important and desirable goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hard work of the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis), who is the primary sponsor on this bill. And I want to commend Mr. Davis for introducing this measure, and I am proud to work with him as the lead cosponsor over these last years. And, hopefully, this time will be the charm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is aimed at ensuring that individuals have access to the information that they truly need to make better investment decisions. And I urge support for <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill>, the Promoting Transparency in Financial Reporting Act. And I also would like to thank the gentleman from Georgia for his hard work on this bill. We started nearly 18 months ago, and it is, I think, a true credit to bipartisanship in a way that it is going to help the American people, help small business, and ultimately help to create jobs and give people the opportunity to see clearly into the operation of the financial markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the post-Enron financial era, transparent reporting has become an increasingly important component of promoting a healthy corporate environment. Financially stable and accountable corporations are essential for expanding the U.S. business sector, promoting investor confidence, and strengthening the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, it is important to examine ways in which such accountability and reporting standards can become both more efficient and more transparent. A cumbersome, costly system will only reduce our competitiveness in a connected world economy and ultimately cost us jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regularly hear complaints from business owners and executives in Kentucky about the costs and complexities of financial reporting requirements mandated by the Federal Government. As a former small business consultant, I know firsthand the difficulties faced during the time-consuming and costly processes of accounting and financial disclosure. Unfortunately, financial reporting remains an arduous task with too many opportunities for error and for manipulation. Reassessing outdated accounting  standards and improving the ability of the average investor to understand and utilize financial documents are essential to the livelihood of American business and the protection of America's investors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Requiring annual congressional testimony by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board stresses that simplification, cost reduction, and transparency in accounting standards and financial reporting are public priorities. <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> will help hold the SEC, FASB, and PCAOB, as well as Congress, accountable for making progress on these important issues. <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> will give Congress a way to measure progress on  the efforts of these organizations over the next 5 years and ensure they are working to streamline and to modernize the process of financial reporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As stated in the bill, we would like to direct attention to several areas of interest: first, we would like to reassess outdated and complex accounting standards; improve the understandability, consistency, and overall usability of the existing accounting and auditing literature; develop principles-based accounting standards; and encourage the use and acceptance of interactive data or extensible business reporting language, also known as XBRL; and, finally, to promote disclosures in plain English.  I think it would be great ultimately for investors not to need a CPA and a lawyer to understand their own financial statements or the reports that they receive from companies they invest in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> isn't intended to imply that these organizations have yet to move towards these goals. In fact, there are many examples of progress already. Each organization has already taken strides to improve financial reporting and the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and I applaud these efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in December, 2006, PCAOB proposed new standards for auditing of internal controls designed to focus auditors on the most important issues. The proposed standards eliminate unnecessary audit requirements and, most importantly, provide guidance on how to adjust the audit for a smaller, less complex company. I appreciate the willingness of the PCAOB to respond to feedback from Congress and the investment community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example is the SEC's encouragement of the use of interactive data. Interactive data uses "tags" for key facts in financial statements so investors can quickly extract and analyze information in an easily understandable format. The SEC recently announced the expansion of the voluntary test program, which already includes two dozen companies representing more than $1 trillion of market value. Participating companies are rewarded with expedited reviews of SEC filings. In turn, the test  group will help the SEC to decide how interactive data can be of most use to investors. These kinds of public and private partnerships will ultimately serve the American people best and keep our markets robust and strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many have criticized the burden and cost of Sarbanes-Oxley, and particularly section 404, on small public companies. It is critical that we strike the right balance between requiring financial reporting to bolster investor confidence and keeping our markets open to both domestic and foreign investment. <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> will help Congress maintain an active and essential role in this balancing act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Modernizing reporting processes, increasing transparency, and reducing the costs of financial reporting will help ease the regulatory burden on businesses and strengthen the ability of individual investors to make educated financial decisions. To quote SEC Chairman Chris Cox, this process is going to be "a long one, but it is worth it to make sure that the capital markets remain strong and vibrant."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Promoting Transparency in Financial Reporting Act will hold the SEC, FASB, and PCAOB, as well as Congress, accountable for making progress on these important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's pass this bill as a first step towards creating a process for continuous improvement that will simplify our financial reporting regulatory framework.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank in particular Ranking Member Bachus, Chairman Frank, and Chairman Kanjorski for their support and my friend from Georgia for his hard work on this to bring this to the floor now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400363" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is, as we mentioned, a very important bill that will certainly increase the confidence of the American people in our financial systems and make it smoother and with less complexity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to also thank the leadership of the Financial Services Committee, Chairmen BARNEY FRANK and KANJORSKI, for their excellent leadership on this very, very important and timely issue. And, again, I want to commend the hard work of my colleague Mr. Davis in providing leadership on this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill>, Promoting Transparency in Financial Reporting Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> is a simple, but important measure. It requires the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Board to provide annual testimony by their respective chairpersons or designees of the chairperson starting next year and for five subsequent years to the Committee on Financial Services on their efforts to reduce the complexity of financial reporting to provide a more accurate and clear financial information to investors,  including:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reassessing complex and outdated accounting standards; improving the understandability, consistency, and overall usability of the existing accounting and auditing literature; developing principles-based accounting standards; encouraging the use and acceptance of interactive data; and promoting disclosures in plain English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In view of the different accounting standards being used in the private sector and government, it is clear that we need to have information that is reliable and credible. Financial information that does not meet rigorous and acceptable standards sends the wrong signals to investors as well as to the public about the real the financial condition of a business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have witnessed over the past several years, the quality of financial information can make the difference between the true value of a company and what the public perceives to be its condition. <bill type="h" number="755">H.R. 755</bill> is an important first step towards making sure that the information being reported to investors and to the public is believable. As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</paragraph>
