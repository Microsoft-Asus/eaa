    <paragraph>Madam President, today I honor the South Dakota State University women's basketball team. In only their third season as Division I competitors, the Jackrabbits made it to the quarterfinals of the Women's  National Invitational Tournament. This impressive accomplishment capped off an extremely successful season in which the Jacks finished with a record of 25-6.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The SDSU women's basketball team has a long tradition of postseason success. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the Jacks qualified for 10 AIAW regional tournaments. As NCAA Division II competitors, they made nine postseason appearances and won the national title in 2003. Additionally, the Jackrabbits reached the Elite Eight in each of their last three seasons as a Division II team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, SDSU transitioned its athletic program to compete in NCAA Division I, becoming the first school in South Dakota to do so. Since this transition, the Jackrabbits women's basketball team has successfully risen to meet the challenge that comes with this new level of competition. By defeating well-known teams with much bigger budgets, this year's team once again proved that SDSU can compete with the top programs in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Jackrabbits were led by Aaron Johnston, who has served as head coach of the SDSU women's basketball team for the past seven seasons. Coach Johnston was responsible for taking the Jacks to the top of NCAA Division II and has shown his strong leadership skills in successfully transitioning the team to Division I. He was the 2006 South Dakota Sportswriters Women's College Basketball Coach of the Year and has been named the Division I Independent Coach of the Year for the past two seasons. Johnston  was supported by Assistant Coaches Laurie Melum, Jina Johansen, and Matt Stamerjohn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, this historic season would be impossible without the players themselves. The athletes of the 2006-2007 South Dakota State University women's basketball team, in alphabetical order, are as follows: Alison Anderson, Maria Boever, Ketty Cornemann, Courtney Grimsrud, Nicole Helsper, Abby Kratovil, Morgan Meier, Ashlea Muckenhirn, Laura Nielsen, Stacie Oistad, Andrea Verdegan, Megan Vogel, and Jennifer Warkenthien.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While all of these women should be commended for their efforts, I would like to especially recognize the team's only senior, Megan Vogel. A 4-year starter, Vogel ended her career as the second leading scorer in SDSU school history with 1,850 career points. During this past season, she led the Jacks in scoring with 17.5 points per game and was chosen as a first-team all-Division I Independent selection for the second time. After participating in the WNBA Pre-Draft Camp, Vogel was chosen as a second  round draft pick by the Washington Mystics. Selected as the 19th overall pick, Vogel became the first Jackrabbit and first player from a South Dakota college to be taken in the WNBA draft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just a few of the many firsts that the Jacks accomplished this season. These student-athletes should be very proud of all of their remarkable achievements. On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I am pleased to say congratulations Jackrabbits on this impressive accomplishment and keep up the great work.</paragraph>
