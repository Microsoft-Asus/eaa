    <bill type="h" number="5614">H.R. 5614</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act shall be known as the "Original Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle Ultra-High Relief Palladium Bullion Coin Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the Augustus Saint-Gaudens $20 gold pieces of 1907 with ultra-high relief are considered by many in the numismatic community to be the most beautiful coins ever produced;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) two separate "pattern" versions of the ultra-high relief Double Eagle were produced in 1907;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) a 34-millimeter version was hand-struck on a standard Double Eagle planchet using a medal press and, because manufacturing and technical limitations prevented mass production of these pieces, this production resulted in low mintage, with fewer than two dozen specimens of the 34-millimeter version known to be in existence today;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) a second, 27-millimeter, version was struck using two stacked $10 Eagle planchets;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) these experimental "pattern" 27-millimeter pieces were deemed to be illegal to produce and all specimens were destroyed except for 2 that reside in the Smithsonian's National Numismatic Collection;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) the 27-millimeter pattern pieces are ranked by numismatists as among the most beautiful coins ever produced, but none are in private hands and none have ever come up for sale;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) the ultra-high relief Double Eagles are representative of the greatest period of American coinage, the so-called "Golden Age of Coinage" in the United States, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) the introduction of this famous piece as a numismatic proof coin would not only give collectors an opportunity to own a version of a legendary coin that has never before been available for private ownership, but also inaugurate a neo-renaissance in United States coin design and demonstrate the technological advances that the United States has achieved over the last century;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) the modern coin version of the $20 gold piece would be updated with the addition of the inscription "In God We Trust" and would include the date of minting or issuance, to distinguish it from the originals and prevent counterfeiting;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) palladium is a rare silver-white metal, and is considered a precious metal because of its scarcity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) palladium is one of 6 platinum group metals that include ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, iridium, and platinum; it is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) the major nations mining palladium are in order of volume: Russia, South Africa, United States of America, and Canada;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) the major mine producing palladium in the United States is located in Montana;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) palladium is fabricated into a wide range of applications that includes its extensive use as an industrial catalyst and a key component in the manufacturing of automotive catalytic converters;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) palladium is also used in dentistry, jewelry, and in the production of surgical instruments and electrical contacts;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (16) the demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use, but also by their role as a store of value;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (17) a variety of investment options are available to palladium investors that includes coins, bars, and exchange-traded funds;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (18) palladium coins have been issued by several countries, mainly as commemorative coins, but also as bullion investment coins (bullion is the form of palladium traded for investment purposes and is a reference to its purity);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (19) Tonga commenced issuing palladium coins in 1967 and other issuing countries have included Canada, the Soviet Union, France, Russia, China, Australia, and Slovakia;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (20) today, only Canada mints palladium bullion coins;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (21) during the period 2003 through 2007, the price of palladium ranged between $148 and $404 per troy ounce, and the average price in 2007 was $355 per troy ounce;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (22) by contrast, during the same period, the price of platinum ranged between a low of $603 and a high $1,544, and the average price in 2007 was $1,303 per troy ounce;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (23) thus, platinum bullion coins have become too expensive for the average investor;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (24) The Royal Canadian Mint minted platinum bullion coins for 14 years (between 1988 and 2001), but ceased production in the face of high metal prices and declining sales;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (25) when the United States Mint's American Eagle Platinum Bullion Coin was launched in 1997, the average price for the metal that year was $395 per troy ounce; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (26) over the past decade, the price has more than tripled, which has caused a dramatic decline in demand for these coins, from 80,050 ounces sold in 1997 to 9,050 in 2007.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. ORIGINAL SAINT-GAUDENS DOUBLE EAGLE ULTRA-HIGH RELIEF BULLION COIN.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

  <narrative> "(A) REPORT REQUIRED.--In an attempt to forestall the counterfeiting or marketing of the coins described in this section, including this subsection, and of collectible, numismatic and rare coins in general, the Comptroller General shall, after consulting with the Director of the United States Secret Service and the Federal Trade Commission, and in consultation with hobbyists, numismatists, law enforcement agencies, and the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, shall submit to the Committee  on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, before the end of the 9-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Original Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle Ultra-High Relief Bullion Coin Act, a report detailing the extent of counterfeiting of rare,</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5614">H.R. 5614</bill>, the Original Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle Ultra-High Relief Palladium Bullion Coin Act, of which I am an original cosponsor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5614">H.R. 5614</bill> instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $20 coins in memory of Augustus Saint-Gauden Double Eagle gold pieces of 1907. The issuing of this coin will begin on January 1, 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The introduction of this famous piece as a collectors' proof coin would not only give collectors an opportunity to own a version of a legendary coin that has never before been available for private ownership but also inaugurate a neo-renaissance in United States coin design. The coin will also demonstrate the technological advances in engraving and minting the U.S. has achieved over the last century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate my friend from the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Castle, for introducing this bill and urge all Members to support its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is simple legislation, as Mr. Gutierrez has said, that directs the creation of an investment-grade coin of palladium made available to those who seek to invest in precious metals as a hedge against inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm happy to be a sponsor of this bill, along with Mr. Gutierrez, the chairman of the Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology Subcommittee that I once chaired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the spike in value of precious metals, investors who recently may have bought gold to put in IRAs have nothing in the standard 1-ounce size investor coin between $18 or so and about $1,000, with gold having jumped in the last couple of years from maybe $400 an ounce to more than $900.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Palladium, known as the fourth precious metal and approved as an investment vehicle by Congress a decade ago, along with gold, silver and platinum, would fill that gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Yesterday it was trading at about $422 an ounce. Palladium is also mined in quantity in the United States. I'm told that more than 400 people work in the Palladium mine in Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, investors do want a choice in their precious metals. And while gold may always be king, if the Mint is going to have a bullion program, it needs to present alternatives. Unfortunately, for many investors, platinum, once valued at nearly the same as palladium, has leapt to nearly $2,000 an ounce, and once-healthy sales of platinum bullion coins shrank to a mere 9,000 ounces last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating a palladium bullion coin will offer investors another option. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this legislation calls for a limited number of the palladium coins to be made with the exact design as the famous gold 1907 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle Ultra-High Relief coin, of which only about a dozen were made because of technical limitations at the time. I understand Mint Director Moy plans to make gold replicas of that coin, and if so, this bill provides that a limited number be sold in a special  presentation case with numismatic versions of the palladium coin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to call Members' attention to a report required at the end of the bill. For some time now we've been hearing of the import and sale into the United States of high-quality fakes of both collectible and investor coins, and more recently of counterfeiting of the special containers that certify a coin's quality as set by an independent grading firm. Mr. Speaker, counterfeiting must be stopped, whether it's of U.S. $100 bills, ancient Greek coins, or high-quality fashion ware.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report required in this bill will, I hope, focus the various parts of the government with jurisdiction over this crime so we can determine the scope and source of the problem and begin taking appropriate action to stop it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge quick passage of the bill.</paragraph>
