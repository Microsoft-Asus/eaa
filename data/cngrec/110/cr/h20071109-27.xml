  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13509]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would yield to my friend, the majority leader, for an update on next week's schedule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished whip for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will not be in session so that we can observe Veterans Day in honor of those who have sacrificed for our country, served our country so ably and well, and to remember those who have paid the ultimate price for our freedoms that we enjoy today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 for morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business and 9 a.m. on Friday. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills, of course, will be announced by the close of business today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under rules, we expect to consider <bill type="h" number="3915">H.R. 3915</bill>, Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, and the conference report on <bill type="h" number="1429">H.R. 1429</bill>, Improving Head Start Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we hope to be able to consider additional conference reports as they become available. And in light of the fact it's our last week before the Thanksgiving break, if there are other items that come to our attention, we will try to move those forward as well. But we don't have notice of those at this point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank you for that information. I certainly agree with your observation about our veterans and the appropriateness of us taking the day on Monday to honor them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that issue, we went to conference this week on two different bills, and my impression was, based on the combination of the Military Construction and Veterans bill with Labor-HHS, that that veterans part of that bill was probably done. I'm wondering if the gentleman has any sense of how we can reinitiate a conference on that bill so that we can get the veterans and the military quality of life, military construction money passed. Is there a plan to go to conference there?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I can't represent to the gentleman the specific plan because I have not gotten that from Mr. Obey, what his thoughts are on that or what his discussions have been with Senator Byrd or with the subcommittee Chairs in both of the bodies. However, we certainly intend to move that forward, as the gentleman suggests, as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I appreciate that. And I would think since essentially it appears that bill has already been conferenced, since it was included with the Labor-HHS bill in conference, that it should be pretty easy to do and hope that we can do it. The President has announced he would sign that bill. The difference in this year's spending and last year's is about $18.5 million dollars a day, and I would hope we could get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the trade agreement this week, I thought we had a significant bipartisan vote on the Peru Trade Agreement. There are three other agreements out there that have been negotiated, and I wonder if the leader has any sense of when we might be able to look toward any of those bills coming to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for that question on the trade bills. We did have a bipartisan vote on the Peru Trade Agreement which incorporated, as we had urged, both worker protections and environmental protections. And with respect to the other three agreements which have been negotiated, Panama, Colombia and South Korea, frankly, we don't yet know. As the gentleman knows, with respect to the agreement with Panama, the complication really doesn't regard the trade agreement as much as it regards  the concern that many people have on both sides of the aisle that the Speaker or President of the Panamanian Parliament is under indictment in the United States with an extradition request for the murder of an American soldier. That, obviously, has complicated the consideration of that agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to Colombia, frankly, I want to tell the gentleman, I don't expect Colombia to come up until next year or South Korea to come up before next year. We obviously have, after  next week, we hope, a short time left to go, maybe six, seven legislative days. So it would be unrealistic to expect us to be able to move these agreements within that time frame. But if we could resolve, I think, the issue regarding Panama, that might be possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. I'd also say that I was heartened by the good work that Chairman Rangel and Mr. McCrery and others did on the Peru agreement, and certainly, I think I want to continue to reach out to you and the chairman and others who'd like to get things done so these bills could come to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colombia is the one that was negotiated next, and because of the Panama complication, it may even be more likely that that could come next.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be pleased to yield to Mr. Rangel for any thoughts he has on that topic.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, it was about the Panama complication, because it was my understanding, to a large extent, that it would be the administration to make the decision or to respond to the answer that you asked of the majority leader. And it's because of the complication that they'll have to decide, politically, as to how they want to handle it, because it goes beyond a trade agreement. It's involved with State Department policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I always get the impression, since the FTA with Korea that's been left out of the discussion with me, that when the administration believes it has completed its negotiation on the executive level, then they too would be coming back to the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And of course Colombia has its own special problems, which we can talk about at a different time. So I just wanted to say, as it relates to Panama and Korea, it was my impression that the administration has to make some major decisions before we can respond.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I appreciate that. And I do know that the chairman has worked hard with the U.S. Trade Ambassador and others, and I'm appreciative of that. And the administration, as this process works, will decide whether to send those up, but I know that they will do that in significant consultation with the chairman and ranking member and, I hope, others in the leadership. And these are important discussions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought we had a significant step in the right direction for our neighborhood this week. To have all of the leaders of both parties vote for a trade agreement was a good sign about the future of our relationships with Panama and, I hope, a good sign about how we approach more of these trade agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other question I had also relates just on the Armenian resolution. I know that a lot of things have happened in regard to that resolution. But I also know that the leader, 3 or 4 weeks ago, maybe it was 4 weeks ago, said that that resolution would be on the floor by November 16. I know it wasn't announced today. I wonder, has any decision been made on advancing that resolution?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would yield to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his question. I did say that. He's correct. However, the principal proponents of that resolution, obviously, the relationship with Turkey is a very important one for the United States. It is a critical time in the Middle East. Turkey has been, obviously, a great help in some respects, sometimes. And so the principal sponsors of that resolution have written a letter to the Speaker and myself and asked us not to move forward with that resolution at this time.  But it is obviously still a matter of great concern to the Speaker, to myself and, frankly, the majority of this House who are sponsors of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in answer to the gentleman's question, I do not expect it to move forward any time soon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. What I believe will be my last question, Mr. Leader, is on Tuesday, knowing this is the last week before there is a break, and we may not stay with the normal procedure, should we expect anything beyond suspension bills on Tuesday? Do you think there's any likelihood, not possibility, but any likelihood of a rule bill as early as Tuesday?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is possible. And the reason I say it's possible is because a lot of Members, obviously, would like to get out. It's Thanksgiving week. We're leaving. And I'm not sure whether it's a majority of your side or the majority, but I think there's probably unanimity that if we could see our way clear to finishing the business that we have by Thursday, they would prefer to work Tuesday night than they would prefer to work on Friday day. So I want to say to my friend it's possible, to facilitate  the work. We're going to be talking about that later on today, and maybe even over the weekend, where we are. So I want to say to the gentleman, it's possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, we'd be pleased to be notified as early as you know about it. And I think you're absolutely right, that Members would be pleased to work a little longer days this week to get some time at home with their families during the holidays.</paragraph>
