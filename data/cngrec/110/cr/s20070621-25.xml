    <paragraph>Mr. President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the last great wave of homesteading upon the prairies of America. Mr. President 1907 was the high water mark of the western boom, the last real chance for entrepreneurs and pioneers to capture 160 acres of free land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Homesteading was one of those singular inventions that proved a triumphant success--one that gave families of modest means a genuine opportunity to share in the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the tens of thousands who surged west to take part in this great enterprise was a family of Bohemian emigrants--the Svihovecs. They are particularly intriguing because seven brothers homesteaded side by side. While it was not unusual for family groups to homestead near each other, the uniqueness of seven brothers doing so was unprecedented in homesteading history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although only two decades removed from their near feudal farm existence in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Svihovecs were shrewd enough to strategically locate their homesteads to nearly surround a section of railroad-owned land, thereby protecting it for their own use and future purchase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These brothers and their equally hearty Czech spouses were Frank and Rose Svihovec, Charles and Anna Svihovec, Vincent and Anna Svihovec, Joseph and Annie Svihovec, Emil and Barbara Svihovec, and two single brother, James, and Louis. Their homesteads were in southwestern North Dakota, along the Hettinger and Adams County line. Two more brothers, Rudolph--and his wife Nellie--and Edward--and his wife Terezie--opted to become businessmen, one in Minneapolis and other in the New York City area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The homesteaders' beginning was inauspicious. There was a train wreck on the way west. Upon their arrival, they were met by the blackened desolation of one of the great western prairie fires which had burned the expected winter feed for their livestock. Snowbound the first winter, they ran out of food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were other setbacks and tragedies, but a life was created for themselves and almost 40 offspring, so many children that the school became known as the Svihovec School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A hundred years later, descendants of these Svihovec pioneers are scattered from London to Los Angeles. A number still remain near the homesteads, in the communities of Mott and Hettinger, and one couple, John and Arlyce Frieze, still actively farm and ranch part of the original homestead lands. Most of the original homesteads, in fact, remain in the ownership of one of the Svihovec families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a remarkable saga, a tale of grit and courage, one that illustrates the kind of strength of character and hardy determination that has served America so well for so many years. The Svihovec tribe has a proud, vital, and continuing legacy that I am honored to acknowledge and salute today in the Senate.</paragraph>
