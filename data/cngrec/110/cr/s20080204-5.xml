  <narrative>THE CHAPLAIN'S PRAYER -- (Senate - February 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="561">S561</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as the prayer was being delivered by our Chaplain, I was here at my place, along with Senator Boxer. During the prayer, Senator Boxer said, "Wow." That really was a "wow" prayer--a prayer that called for peace and understanding. I wish I could recite it from memory, as the good Chaplain did, with his great ability to restate things that have been said. We really appreciated that prayer. I was very impressed, as I am so often, by the thoughtfulness  of this prayer. This was a prayer which could have been uttered in a synagogue, in a Catholic mass, or any religious gathering in the world. This would have been fitting for any of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are very fortunate to have this retired admiral, who came to the Senate in his capacity as our Chaplain, to recite prayers and lead us, as he often does, in discussions. I am without words to express my appreciation for his good work.</paragraph>
