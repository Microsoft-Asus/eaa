  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we in America are at an energy crossroad. Now, one road will lead to price controls and a potential energy crisis that would remind us of the 1970s. The other would lead to cutting-edge technology that will provide affordable, reliable energy for decades to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, the liberal leadership in this House has chosen to revert to the 1970s and repeat that history. Today, the Energy appropriations bill under consideration will underfund nuclear production by $20 million in one account, hydroelectric power by $20 million in another account, and other forms of American productivity by hundreds of millions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And where does the money go? Well, it goes to fund research for climate change in another bow to the religion of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in coordination with other House and some Senate legislation, we find out that some of these proposals could end up raising the price of a gallon of gas over the next couple of decades to $6 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to focus on energy independence today. It is what the American people want.</paragraph>
