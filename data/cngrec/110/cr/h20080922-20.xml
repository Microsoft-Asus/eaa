    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site, located in Brownsville, Texas, is the only National Park Service unit dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of the Mexican-American War. The park preserves the site of the Battle of Palo Alto, the first battle of the war, but fighting was not limited to the parcel of land currently preserved by the park. Fighting at a site called Resaca de la Palma proved pivotal in permanently repulsing the Mexican army from  Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4828">H.R. 4828</bill> would amend the act creating Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site to designate the 34 acres of the Resaca de la Palma as a unit of the park. In recognition of the expansion of the park to include the noncontiguous Resaca de la Palma unit, the bill will also redesignate Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site as Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good piece of legislation, and I commend my colleague and my good friend, Representative Solomon Ortiz from Texas, for his hard work on adding this unit to the park. I enthusiastically support passage of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this legislation. The Palo Alto battlefield in Brownsville, Texas is the site of the second battle of the U.S. War with Mexico. During the battle, American forces drove Mexican troops back across the Rio Grande River. This bill adds 34 acres to the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site and provides for a cooperative agreement under which the Brownsville Community Foundation and the National Park Service would co-manage this land that is owned by the foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ortiz), the sponsor of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400302" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to say thank you to both Chairman Bordallo and my good friend from Alaska (Mr. Young) who have had an opportunity to spend time in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="4828">H.R. 4828</bill>, the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park Boundary Expansion and Redesignation Act of 2008. The battle of Resaca de la Palma--fought in 1846 in what is now the city of Brownsville, Texas--marked one of the early victories in the United States-Mexican War for the American forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Zachary Taylor, who would later become the 12th President of the United States, was a very notable participant in this battle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The United States troops suffered 45 men dead and 228 wounded; Mexican forces counted 169 dead and 228 wounded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4828">H.R. 4828</bill> will expand the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site, currently under the National Park Service, to include the Resaca de la Palma Battlefield site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will preserve the battlefield site, support education and special events there, and develop an interpretive trail with exhibits, living history programs, and other community gatherings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The site will also conserve the increasingly rare Rio Grande delta landscape and protect native chaparral, prairie and brush, and native species. It used to be more than 100 acres, but now it has been reduced to 34 aches of land, so we need to preserve this site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the battle at Resaca de la Palma was fought by two warring nations, it is historically significant because it is unique to the south Texas border culture. More than just a relic of the past, the Resaca de la Palma Battlefield is a vast, outdoor classroom that preserves a vital piece of our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is that scholars, historians, and everyday citizens will learn and appreciate the sacrifice of all those who perished here on this battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A coalition of local groups, community leaders, and private citizens has done a tremendous job in maintaining the Resaca de la Palma. I wish to thank them for their hard work and dedication in preserving an important piece of our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is now vital for the site to have full support and resources that only the National Park Service can provide. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I thank you and Chairman YOUNG and Chairman BORDALLO for supporting this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I have no other requests for speakers. I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I again urge Members to support this very important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
