  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1109">H. Res. 1109</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas Dith Pran was born on September 23, 1942, in Siem Reap, Cambodia, a provincial town near the ancient temples at Angkor Wat; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith, a photojournalist and human rights advocate, became the face of the atrocities in Cambodia carried out by the Khmer Rouge; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith learned French and English in school and became a translator of Khmer for the United States Armed Forces and visiting film crews while he worked as a receptionist at a hotel near Angkor Wat prior to the escalation of the Vietnam War; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, during much of the early 1970s, Mr. Dith was a guide, interpreter, and friend of Sydney H. Schanberg of the New York Times; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the friendship and partnership between Mr. Dith and Mr. Schanberg became the basis for the 1984 film, "The Killing Fields", which showed the brutality perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979 under Pol Pot; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas nearly 2,000,000 Cambodians died from 1975 to 1979 at the hands of the Khmer Rouge; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith saved Mr. Schanberg and other Western journalists from being executed by persuading Khmer Rouge soldiers that they were journalists sympathetic to the Khmer Rouge cause; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith's wife and children were able to leave Cambodia for the United States through Mr. Schanberg's connections, but Mr. Dith was unable to obtain a passport or visa to leave the country; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, for four years, Mr. Dith disguised himself as a peasant, worked in rice fields, and endured regular beatings and harsh labor while living on a diet of a tablespoon of rice a day because the Khmer Rouge would often kill anyone who appeared educated or even wore glasses; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in November 1978, Mr. Dith returned to his home of Siem Reap, and discovered that 50 members of his family had been killed; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith fled 60 miles to the border of Thailand and arrived, on October 3, 1979, where Mr. Schanberg flew to greet him; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith had an emotional reunion with his wife, Ser Moeun Dith, and their four children when he arrived in San Francisco; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith moved to New York, New York, and was hired in 1980 as a photographer for The New York Times; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Mr. Dith was a tireless activist speaking out about the Cambodian genocide and once stating, "I'm a one person crusade"; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas soon after the release of the film "The Killing Fields", Mr. Dith became a United States citizen and a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, in 1994, Mr. Dith worked to help pass the Cambodian Genocide Justice Act of 1994, sponsored by former Senator Charles Robb of Virginia, which established an Office of Cambodian Genocide Investigations at the Department of State; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, on March 30, 2008, Mr. Dith, a resident of Woodbridge, New Jersey, passed away at the age of 65; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Dith Pran Holocaust Awareness Project was established to create awareness about the Cambodian genocide: Now, therefore, be it &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) honors the life and legacy of Mr. Dith for his commitment to raising awareness about the atrocities that took place under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes his courage and his endless pursuit for justice for the victims of the Cambodian genocide and all peoples around the world who have been victims of genocide; and</narrative>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Sires, for offering this important legislation in memory of a great American, Dith Pran. Through the film "The Killing Fields," Dith Pran is for many Americans the face of the Cambodian genocide. That movie documented Dith Pran's personal struggle, his friendship and cooperation with New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg, and the larger horror of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much as "The Killing Fields" reminded Americans of the Cambodian genocide, Mr. Dith's life work as a photojournalist and U.N. goodwill ambassador raised awareness around the world of the atrocities that took place for those in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution commemorates the work of Dith Pran's life, including his work as a photojournalist for the New York Times, his bravery in surviving the Cambodian genocide and escaping to Thailand in 1979; his advocacy for the Cambodian refugees and victims of genocide around the world after he became a U.S. citizen and a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations in 1994; and his work with former Senator Charles Robb to help pass the Cambodian Genocide Justice Act establishing an Office of Cambodian  Genocide Investigations at the State Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Dith's work laid the foundation for ongoing justice and reconciliation tribunals within Cambodia that continue to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all these reasons, I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to join me as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which serves as yet another reminder of the haunting words inscribed in the Holocaust Museum: "Never again."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Khmer Rouge-led slaughter of over 1 million innocent people took place more than three decades after the Holocaust ended. Yet the world was again largely silent and indifferent to this tragedy. There was no one person who more embodied the tragic and horrific story of this genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia than Dith Pran. His harrowing personal story of courage, abandonment, struggle, escape and ultimate survival was recorded for all time in the gripping Academy Award-winning  film "The Killing Fields."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After escaping from the Khmer Rouge and making his way across a treacherous border laden with mines, Dith Pran reached a refugee camp in Thailand and ultimately came to the United States. Here while continuing his career as a photojournalist, Dith Pran was a firm and clear voice appealing to the world's conscience to remember the genocide which occurred in his homeland. He worked tirelessly to achieve the establishment of an Office of Cambodian Genocide. It was officially called the Office of  Cambodian Genocide Investigation in the Department of State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a note of some consolation that Dith Pran lived to see the start of the genocide trial last November of surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sadly, it took almost 30 years to bring these architects of the killing fields to justice. There is thankfully no statute of limitations for those who carry out world genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without Dith Pran's steadfast determination, however, this aging Khmer Rouge cadre may have escaped their final hour of judgment. This trial now taking place in the Cambodian capital should give solace to Dith Pran's family and his friends at his passing. It also represents his greatest legacy as an advocate on human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current trial should also remind us to redouble our efforts to ensure that the words "Never Again" are finally realized. The best final tribute for Dith Pran would be for the world community to work together for a swift end to the current genocide in Darfur and the killing fields in North Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to give their whole-hearted support to this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
