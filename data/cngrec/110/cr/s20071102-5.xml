    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business today, with Members allowed to speak therein for whatever time they feel is appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be no rollcall votes today or tomorrow as a result of our being able to work something out on a very contentious Children's Health Initiative Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, it is expected the Senate will receive the veto message on the water resources conference report. This measure passed with overwhelming votes in both the House and Senate. If it continues to have broad, bipartisan support, the veto will be overridden.</paragraph>
