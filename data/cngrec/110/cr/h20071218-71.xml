  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CONGRESSWOMAN JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16802]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 1st Samuel, chapter 20, verse 18, reads as follows: "Then Jonathan said to David, tomorrow is the New Moon Festival. You will be missed because your seat will be empty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Indiana delegation pause to celebrate the life of a great woman whose seat now stands empty here in the House of Representatives, Congresswoman JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Carson passed away this past Saturday after a long bout with lung cancer. And while her seat is empty, her spirit lives on in our hearts. She was unique. She often reminded me of the elders in my family. They are  strong in their convictions and don't pull any punches when making their point; yet they have a witty and humorous way about them that can disarm even their most ardent opponent. That was Congresswoman JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though she was in her last illness, she did not let that stop her from advocating on behalf of her constituents. And she never complained. She always greeted you with a warm smile and that unmistakable humor which always made you feel good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a trailblazer, born in poverty and racial segregation to a teenage single mother. She came through the political ranks to become the first African American and woman elected to Congress from Indianapolis. A strong advocate for her constituents, she was not afraid to take a stand, be it popular or unpopular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I will include for the Record an article that was in today's Roll Call that was written by her predecessor Andy Jacobs as a guest observer and was entitled "Remembering Congress' Jewel Named Julia." It is a wonderful article. I won't go through it because we have a lot of people here who want to speak about their remembrances of our wonderful colleague JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[From Roll Call, Dec. 18, 2007]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Remembering Congress' Jewel Named Julia</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Andy Jacobs, Jr.)</narrative>
  <narrative>"Look where he came from and look where he went; and wasn't he a kind of tough struggler all his life right up to the finish?" The words are those of Carl Sandburg in praise of Abraham Lincoln. The same praise could and should be said of our sister, the late Rep. Julia Carson (D-Ind.), who has passed beyond the sound of our voices into the sunset of her temporal life and into a dawn of history.</narrative>
  <narrative>Where did she come from? Same place as Lincoln--Kentucky. And like him, she was born both to physical poverty and spiritual wealth, and moved to Indiana.</narrative>
  <narrative>Another similarity: Julia also had an "angel mother," Velma Porter, who put a lot of physical, mental and spiritual nutrients into the little flowerpot of her only child.</narrative>
  <narrative>Fast-forward to a month after my first and improbable election to Congress. I was told by mutual friends that at the Chrysler UAW office, I could find a remarkable woman to join me as a co-worker in my Washington Congressional office. Remarkable? Understatement. Thus began my 47-year friendship and, eventually virtual sibling-ship with the already honorable Julia Carson, one of the most intelligent, ethical, industrious and compassionate people I have ever known.</narrative>
  <narrative>Check out her first Congressional brainstorm. It started a national trend. Why make constituents in need of Congressional assistance with bureaucratic problems travel all the way to D.C. to get it? Why not take that part of the office to them? So we adopted her suggestion and did out "case work" in Indianapolis with Julia at the helm. It set an example that has been followed by other Congressional offices all over the country ever since. OK, there was one other factor. She had two little kids  she preferred to rear in Indianapolis, doing well by her kids by doing good for her country.</narrative>
  <narrative>Later, my refusal to bring home a particularly pernicious piece of political pork earned me a severe gerrymander that, together with the Nixon landslide, ejected me from Congress. Nothing is all bad; the beneficiary of the gerrymander was my much-admired friend, Bill Hudnut (R). That was the year I had to talk Julia into running for the state House of Representatives. She thought it would be disloyal to our friendship because it would take her away from my campaign, which was a campaign of futility  that year.</narrative>
  <narrative>She was elected to the state House, where she served with distinction and, in time, she became a state Senator, again gaining friends and admirers on both sides of the aisle.</narrative>
  <narrative>Still later, she became the Center Township trustee and produced real "welfare reform," not with ignorant histrionic speeches and braggadocio, but with hard, quiet and meticulous work. It was reform that broke no poor child's heart, nor sent such a child to bed hungry. She not only ferreted out welfare cheats, but also sued them and got the money back for the taxpayers. Her reform wiped out a long-standing multimillion-dollar debt, moving the then-Marion County Republican auditor to say, "She  wrestled the monster to the ground."</narrative>
  <narrative>Julia was unique in that she was the only human being ever to be named Woman of the Year by The Indianapolis Star on two different occasions.</narrative>
  <narrative>It was common parlance to say, "Congresswoman Carson's people," a reference to poor black constituents. Rubbish. The 7th district is about 70 percent nonblack and "her people" were all the people of the 7th, regardless of physical or economic description. Millionaires can be treated unjustly by the federal government just as middle- and low-income citizens can. And wherever there was injustice, this Lincoln-like lady was there to redress it. Her political philosophy was a plank from the Sermon  on the Mount: "Blessed are they who thirst for justice."</narrative>
  <narrative>There's another one: "Blessed are the peacemakers." She cast our vote against the conspicuously unconstitutional resolution that gave the Cheney gang a fig leaf to order our innocent military to the fraudulent and internationally illegal blood-soaked blunder in Iraq.</narrative>
  <narrative>Julia called me just before she cast that vote and said that, in view of the dishonesty, panic and jingoism of the moment, she expected to lose the next election. "Courage," my mother said, "is fear that has said its prayers."</narrative>
  <narrative>Our Julia, who art in Heaven.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am going to begin with the dean of the Indiana delegation, Representative Dan Burton.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to thank the Black Caucus for taking this Special Order tonight. JULIA CARSON was a friend of mine and a friend of STEVE BUYER. We traveled back and forth on the plane from Indianapolis to Washington on a regular basis and we got to know each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA was a wonderful person, very highly regarded by the people of Indianapolis. In fact, she is the only woman in the history of the city who was recognized as Woman of the Year by the Indianapolis Star twice. That honor came to her by readers of the paper voting for her. That was quite an honor, an honor that has not been bestowed upon any other woman in the city's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing I really liked about JULIA was that even though she was a Democrat and I was a Republican, we worked together on a lot of issues that were very important to central Indiana and the City of Indianapolis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember one case in particular that dealt with the Children's Museum. I talked to JULIA about it, and she took the bull by the horns and worked very hard to make sure that the problems that we had with the Children's Museum were resolved, and I really admired her for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her predecessor and her buddy, Andy Jacobs, to whom you just referred in that article, really loved her like a sister. Andy served here for, I think, 28 or 30 years, and he is a very dear friend of mine, and Andy has told me on a number of occasions the great contributions that JULIA made to him and his staff when she worked for him before she became a Congresswoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a State representative. When Andy was defeated in 1972, he urged her to run for the Indiana House of Representatives, and she did. She was elected, and then she was later elected to the Indiana State Senate. Then she ran for the Center Township Trustee's job in Indianapolis and was elected to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing I talked about yesterday when we were acknowledging JULIA that I didn't know much about until just recently was that when she took over the Center Township Trustee's job, it was in a chaotic situation. And she was able to take care of the needs of the people of Indianapolis that really needed help and at the same time to reduce the budget of the Trustee's office, and that was something that I think all of us, Republican or Democrat, really can admire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a very fine Congresswoman. She was a very fine person. She always had a smile for everybody, and I really appreciated knowing her. She shall be missed. I think that she is probably in heaven looking down on us right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA, you did a good job.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I now yield to my colleague and good friend, the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Kilpatrick. And I had an opportunity to visit with Congresswoman Carson a couple of weeks before her passing. It was a wonderful chance. I yield to our Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Carolyn CHEEKS KILPATRICK.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Members of the House of Representatives, and people across this great Nation of ours, we have lost a jewel in Julia Carson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met the Congresswoman some 30 years ago, and she from the legislature in Indiana and I from the legislature in Michigan served 18 years together in those legislative bodies, and then came here together in 1997 to begin our tenure in the United States House of Representatives, she from Indiana, me from Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We both got assigned to the Financial Services Committee our first term,  she from Indiana and I from Michigan. And together, during this 10 years of journey, we have worked together in this House of Representatives. Courageous, bold, smart, intelligent, compassionate. All those things that you want in a public servant, JULIA CARSON was that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the people of Indianapolis, the State of Indiana, you have lost a jewel. And all that we ask in this body of 435 of the most powerful people in the world, as well as the 100 most powerful people in the Senate, is that you send us another JULIA CARSON: intelligent, bold, compassionate, a coordinator, one who speaks for the people that she represents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Carson and I have had many battles and many struggles together. As was mentioned earlier by our chairperson of our Ethics Committee who is handling this Special Order tonight, she and I were in Indiana in her room with her 2 weeks ago. She looked beautiful. Her skin was radiant. Her heart was strong. And she said to us, thank you. Thank you to us as her sisters, and thank you to the people of Indiana who have been with her for over 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we come together tonight as members of the Congressional Black Caucus as well as members of the Indiana caucus, because we know she lives. We know she is in these walls and looking upon us now. What are you doing, girl? What are you all talking about? Thank you, JULIA. We love you, my sister.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as we continue in our journey today, let's take a little bit of Congresswoman JULIA CARSON with us, dedicated, compassionate, take no prisoners, speak for the least of these. Thank you, my sister. And may you rest in peace.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>At this time, I yield to Representative PETER VISCLOSKY, who is the dean of the Democrat delegation of Indiana.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, my good friend from Ohio, to honor JULIA CARSON and her life of work to the people she represented in her district, to the people of Indiana, and this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday on this floor, I talked about the light that JULIA cast upon all of us, whether it was the twinkle in her eye or her burning desire to make the world a better place. This evening, I would like to talk about the strength of her character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA, when she was a young child, had a stuttering problem; but it was corrected and she was not deterred. As a 12-year-old, her mother, who scrubbed floors and took care of families and didn't get paid if she was sick, became ill; and at some point, the money had run out. JULIA went to the trustee's office to seek help, and, ultimately, cornmeal and lard were pushed across the counter to her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When JULIA was 4 years old, for the only time in her life, she met her father. Her father promised that he was going to be a constant figure in her life. He gave her $5, and he was never seen again. Her mother remarried to someone who used to beat her. And often her mother could not come to her school events because he was someplace taking care of someone else's children. And she certainly, being a product of that time and that place, was subject to racism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an article she wrote in March of 1996, when she was running for Congress, entitled "My Neighbor as Myself," she related one of those instances. And I think it really summed up JULIA, who could be very tough but also have a general touch. She wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Another more amusing experience with racial stereotyping occurred when I worked with Congressman Andy Jacobs. One particular woman called our office quite often to complain about a wide variety of problems. I tried to be patient with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I never realized that my many conversations with this woman had all occurred on the telephone until one day when she called, quite agitated, to inform me that a horrible thing had happened: a black family had moved in next door to her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It took me a minute to overcome my surprise, as she simply assumed that this competent public servant had to be white. However, after thinking about a wide assortment of possible responses, I simply replied, `It is okay, honey. Just give it a chance. I have black families living all over my neighborhood, and it has turned out all right.' " And you could just see JULIA saying that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the end, many people would be embittered by experiences like that, but JULIA was not. And as Andy Jacobs, her very dear friend, wrote: From the physical pain of material poverty and the mindless cruel persecution of racism, JULIA CARSON made her choice, a choice of hard work, compassion, and a pleasing sense of humor. And heaven smiled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I know heaven is smiling on JULIA tonight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>At this time, I yield to the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, who is the Chair of the committee that JULIA served upon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Ohio and the other friends who have gathered to, really, mourn our own loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I served on the Financial Services Committee with JULIA CARSON. And let's be honest, there are Members of this body who, if you get to see them coming before they see you, you may not have a long conversation. But I sought JULIA's company. She was a dedicated fighter for social justice, but she was also a delightful woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had that kind of air she put on of, "Oh, poor me." I feel sorry for anybody who fell for it. She had a brilliant mind, a wonderful sense of strategy, and, as I said, she put all that at the service of caring for poor people. As a member of the Financial Services Committee, she was a constant unyielding advocate for fairness in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I do also want to note, a number of people have mentioned my former colleague, many of us served with him, Andy Jacobs. Andy was the Congressman from that district. He retired. And rarely has any politician fought as hard for another politician as Andy Jacobs did to elect JULIA CARSON. And to the minds of many, JULIA wasn't a natural fit. People thought that she was not conservative enough for the district, not, let's be honest, white enough for the district. And race  continues to be the besetting problem of America. We have made some progress in it. We haven't solved it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Andy Jacobs' dedication to helping to elect JULIA, and, obviously, she got there on her own, But Andy's helping run interference as JULIA carried that ball really was one of the great acts of statesmanship, and then JULIA made the most of the opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of going out to her district a couple of times because there was this sense on the part of some that a woman like JULIA CARSON, with her background and her set of values, couldn't possibly represent Indianapolis. Somehow they thought that something had gone wrong. But the people knew better, and the people stood by her. And they stood by her because she was, as I said, as staunch a fighter for making this the kind of America we all want to live in as I ever saw.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I miss her a great deal. I miss coming into the committee and seeing her pretending to look kind or angry and sad, with a twinkle in her eye ready for that comment that was going to put everything in perspective. JULIA CARSON was a wonderful Member of this body. And the dignity with which she bore her last months of pain troubled all of us, but it was a fitting example of the extraordinary quality of a great woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio and others for giving us this chance to express our appreciation for having had the benefit of her colleagueship for a while.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield time now to Mr. Buyer, a member of the Indiana delegation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to agree with my friend and colleague, Barney Frank. We watched someone of great strength suffer from the cruelness of cancer. And it was really hard to watch JULIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an individual that I spent more time in the airport with than ever here in Congress. And those of us who fly back and forth, we know what that is like. For 11 years in the Indianapolis airport is really where I spent most of my time with JULIA CARSON. She and I shared a subcommittee leadership on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, but that doesn't even come close to the times in the Indianapolis airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would rather remember the lady that I first met. JULIA CARSON is an individual that, no, this is a lady that wore a big hat, with a witty personality, with a great smile, and a big heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I also pity the individual that fell for any of her, oh, shucky darns wit, I just don't understand; can you help explain it to me? Because you lost if you believed any of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She suckered me in pretty good when it came to the support of the Midfield terminal with the Indianapolis airport. She had just got on the Transportation Committee. She understood the need for infrastructure for a city like Indianapolis and, gee, she wanted some of my help. And before I realized it, I am carrying the water heater, getting the letter, getting the support from all of the Indiana delegation, and said, oh, it would be okay if you go down and talk to the FAA. I mean, she was steering  me the whole time. But I didn't mind. It was for the betterment of Indianapolis and Indiana. But don't let anybody fool you who was really controlling the strings here. It was JULIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what a great lady. A great lady, because this Hoosier treated kindness like grain. She understood that, if she sows it, kindness will only increase. And I think she used that in her life. She used a kindness to go after her political enemies. She used that big smile and kindness to achieve great things. And it was also an enduring quality about her. And that is what I want to remember JULIA most by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to end with this, because she loved her Indianapolis Colts. When it came to the redistricting in Indiana, and we all know what redistricting is like: sometimes maps and the lines can go down the alleyways and sidewalks almost. But she made sure that her district, that etched in and it took the headquarters of the Indianapolis Colts and the training facility because she wanted her boys, as she told me. I said, JULIA, I have got most of this territory all surrounded, and you went  deep down the road and etched out and took them out. And she smiled and she said, Those are my boys. And she loved her Indianapolis Colts, and I am glad that she got to see the Colts have that Super Bowl on her watch, because it only made her smile even that much greater and that much bigger. And that is the JULIA CARSON that I remember and loved.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to comment as well that I want to remember JULIA CARSON because she was a fantastic dresser. She was always immaculately dressed, all kinds of wonderful outfits. And I always think about how great she used to look as she came on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, I yield time to my colleague and good friend from the great State of North Carolina, a former Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, MEL WATT.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400424" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me, first of all, thank the gentlelady for convening this Special Order in memory of our dear friend and colleague, JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you didn't know JULIA CARSON, you probably would think she was a study in contradictions. That is kind of always the way I felt about her. She was this person that, from the very beginning when she came to Congress, which was the first time I met her, appeared to be a very fragile person. You would see her on the floor and she didn't appear to be well; and yet you would go on a trip to South Africa, and there she would be out among the children meeting with them and undertaking  the rigors of an international trip that you knew was an imposition physically on the most physically fit Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>You would see her and talk to her and her voice would be so mild and gentle, and yet when she undertook an issue, it was just like a metamorphosis because she was so articulate and passionate about that issue. And you would see her and she would look at you sternly and make a quip, and you would walk away thinking it was kind of a straightforward statement. And then all of a sudden it would dawn on you she had zinged you without you even being aware of a subtle point that she had made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were these contradictions there that I loved about JULIA CARSON. Once you got to know her, sometimes she would game you, as Barney Frank has indicated. She would appear unsophisticated politically, and then all of a sudden she would pull one of the most important political maneuvers, like the tribute to Rosa Parks that took such delicate balancing to pull the elements together. This was a woman, a lady of contradictions, apparent contradictions, yet once you got to know</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that I know there are many who wish to speak, so I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for calling this Special Order, and I am very humbled to be able to stand on behalf of the people of eastern Indiana and express my deepest sympathies to the family and colleagues of my friend, the late JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bible tells us to mourn with those who mourn and to grieve with those who grieve. Tonight on the floor of Congress, we gather to do just that. To mourn with the many tens of thousands of grateful constituents who are remembering JULIA CARSON this week and who owe a debt of gratitude to her for 30 years of service to the people of Indianapolis that they know in their hearts they will never be able to repay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I grieve the passing of JULIA CARSON for a variety of reasons. First, for her service. She will be remembered as a pioneering leader in the State of Indiana. As the first woman and the first African American elected to Congress from Indianapolis, she will be long remembered in Indiana public life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remember her throughout my own years in politics in trying to get into politics, seeming to see her contribute first as a State legislator, then as a legendary Center Township Trustee in Indianapolis, and later elected to the United States Congress. She was, and I say with affection, a fierce political competitor and succeeded at everything she tried to do, in politics and public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentle demeanor that we are remembering tonight belied a freight train of effectiveness that was JULIA CARSON. And I experienced that effectiveness, usually on the losing side of an argument. But what I would always find in JULIA CARSON is, while she was a fierce advocate here on the floor of the Congress for what she understood to be the needs of her district and the obligations of the law and of justice, that walking back to our offices after the fact, I would never fail to  be moved by her gentleness and her kindness and her decency, which leads me to the other piece of JULIA that I will always treasure, and that was her profound Christian faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must tell you as a cheerful conservative Republican elected to Congress having observed her career from afar, I would have told anyone in Indiana that the last person I expected to be friends with in Congress was JULIA CARSON. She was tough. She was effective. She was liberal. But when I arrived in Congress as a new freshman, she reached out to me, and she reached out to me on the basis of our shared Christian faith. And it was on that foundation that we built a friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we, on occasion, found ways to work together. Working with her to pass legislation authored by another colleague in the Chamber today, the Second Chance Act, it would be JULIA CARSON that would appeal to this House conservative about the needs of breaking the cycle of recidivism and crime that beset so many families in the underserved community, but it would be her heart on that matter that would reach me with the wisdom of the Second Chance Act. And part of her legacy here today will  be the success that we have seen that legislation experience this year and, I trust, in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every time I would ask her in her infirmity in the last year and a half how she was doing, I don't know how she would answer the rest of the Members here, Madam Speaker, but whenever I would quietly say, "JULIA, really, how are you doing?" she would smile in that infirmity and say, "I am blessed by the best." No complaints, no grumbling. "Blessed by the best" will be her legacy in my heart. To know that as I have the privilege of serving here, whatever the condition in which I serve,  I will understand He who placed me here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think of that great verse. I don't know what the pastor will say at Eastern Star Saturday. My wife Karen and I will be there, as I know most of this Chamber would wish to be there at her funeral. I don't know what the pastor of that great church will say, but when I think of JULIA CARSON, I think of that mandate that we are called to do justice, love kindness, and to walk humbly with our God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The JULIA CARSON I remember tonight and will always remember throughout my years in public service did justice as she understood it. She loved kindness even to those with whom she differed, and every day she was here, she walked humbly in the service of the people of Indiana. For that, we, as a State and as a Nation, will be eternally grateful.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At this time it gives me pleasure to yield to my colleague and good friend from California, BARBARA LEE.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for calling this Special Order to recognize and honor the extraordinary life of our dear friend and colleague JULIA MAY CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I would like to offer my deepest condolences to her family and her constituents of Indiana's Seventh Congressional District, to her friends and to her staff here in Washington, DC, and in Indiana. For over 35 years, Congresswoman Carson championed the rights of the underprivileged, the underrepresented and the overlooked. We came to depend on her determined leadership and commitment throughout her tenure in Congress. So a true voice for the voiceless was taken from us on December 15.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We shared many conversations about our common interests. We frequently talked about the fact that we both shared the same astrological sign. We are both Cancers. JULIA's birthday was July 8. Mine is July 16. JULIA CARSON was fiercely loyal and patriotic, and that supposedly is a typical characteristic of Cancers. She exemplified those values, though, in many, many ways. Her loyalty and her patriotism was what undergirded and served as the foundation for her career in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In coming to the House floor to vote, I would pass by her office. Oftentimes, I would walk with JULIA. We would share many conversations. But even to this day I noticed, and I would like for you to look at the plaque outside her door, she has the pictures of at least 45 of Indiana's fallen men and women who have served this country. She kept their pictures in her office. She loved the troops. She loved her district and our young men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a woman of courage. Congresswoman Carson was an adamant opponent of the Iraq war, and we talked about this a lot, even though it could pose political risks, but she let her conscience be her guide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I witnessed her passion for justice when I served with her on the Housing Subcommittee with Congresswoman Waters, her passion for the homelessness and seeking housing for homeless public recipients. What a woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very recently, even with her debilitating illness, several months ago she came to me and asked me to help her. We were putting this together, to put together another visit to South Africa. She wanted to lead a codel. And of course her health would not allow for this exhausting trip, but I will always remember up until a couple of months ago her optimism and determination to go back to South Africa. She wouldn't take "no" for an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to miss Congresswoman Carson tremendously. I am reminded of the scriptures, Timothy 4, Chapter 7: I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Congresswoman JULIA CARSON fought hard. She fought hard for peace and justice all of her life, and she completed her work on this Earth, but it is up to us to pick up that baton and to move it forward in her memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And she remained faithful. She remained faithful to the end to her family, her friends, her constituents, her country, and most importantly to her God. May her soul rest in peace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues as we pay tribute to Representative JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA and I were elected at the same time and soon discovered that we knew many of the same people because a large number of individuals from the town where I grew up migrated to Indianapolis and became very much involved in the affairs of the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also discovered that JULIA and my cousin were good friends because they were the longest serving African Americans elected in Indiana. They both had been trustees for a long time, JULIA in Indianapolis and Dozier Allen in Gary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But JULIA and I worked together on something called responsible fatherhood legislation that we had been working with Senator EVAN BAYH from Indiana and Senator BARACK OBAMA from Illinois. We introduced that legislation and actually planned to give it a real push in 2008. If we are able to really move it, I would like to see us actually name it the JULIA CARSON Responsible Fatherhood Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And so it's been a pleasure working with JULIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She actually would drive. Well, she wouldn't always drive herself, but sometimes she would, from Indianapolis to Chicago. We had a hearing at the Federal Reserve Bank, and I get there downtown Chicago, there's JULIA in her van, coming to testify. And all of us knew that she'd been ill. All of us knew the difficulty that she had. And I said, JULIA, how did you get here? She said, Ain't nothing but a little sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so JULIA, we're going to miss you. You were a brave soul, had a great heart. JULIA is a legend in Indianapolis. I mean, those of us who know her here, we know her in a sense. But in Indianapolis, she's an absolute legend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Carol and I will remember that JULIA kept saying to us, look out for Andre. She loved her son and daughter, but she loved that grandson, Andre Carson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure at this time to yield time to JOE DONNELLY, a member of the Indiana delegation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412205" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is interesting you mention Andre, because I was at JULIA's house just about a week or two ago where they had a vigil in Indianapolis while JULIA was so sick, and Andre was outside. And the amazing thing was it was a spontaneous vigil that had started approximately 3 in the afternoon on a Friday. And in a matter of just a few hours, we all congregated at her house at approximately 6:30. And so I headed on over there, and it was spectacular, to say the least. There  were police cars everywhere, and what they were trying to do was control the huge crowd that had come to JULIA's house to testify for her and to pray for her and to show her how much they loved her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at that time, JULIA was so ill that she was not able to come outside the house. But she had friends and relatives come out and say JULIA isn't able to come out and speak for herself, but she told us to tell you how much she loved you. And the best part of the crowd was that it wasn't the captains of industry. It wasn't all the famous politicians over the years from Indiana. It was the regular, everyday folks who came out to show her how much they appreciated her hard work over  the years; that every time they needed a champion, JULIA CARSON was there for them. And when you needed a friend, and JULIA CARSON stood up for you, you had no stronger champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember, I'm from the South Bend area, and I called to JULIA in a very, very tough congressional race that nobody thought could be won and said, could you come up and help me? And she said, Son, I'll be on my way. And when she came up, the crowds came out. And I remember we have a railway system there that's critical to our infrastructure. And JULIA was able to get so much of the funding for it. And she wanted to take a ride. And the press was out there, and she was still ill  at that time. And the train was supposed to leave at 8 in the morning. And about five of 8, no JULIA, about 8, still no JULIA. Her chief of staff is standing there very, very nervously, and he said, she'll be here very soon. And the conductor said, well, we have to go. And I turned to the conductor and I said, my guess is you'd be better</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I followed her one time at an event where everybody had 5 minutes to speak. And I followed JULIA Carson. And telling JULIA CARSON she had 5 minutes to speak was like waving a red flag in front of a bull. So JULIA spoke for 41 minutes. And then she looked over at me and said, Sorry about that. And the gentleman in charge of the event looked at me and said, Your 5 minutes is now 1 1/2  minutes. And I got up, and the only thing I could say is, How do you follow someone who has  spoken so eloquently and said so much?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss her in an extraordinary way. She had a wonderful staff, people truly devoted to her. But more than anything, she was devoted to her beloved city of Indianapolis, and they repaid that love to her with their care and affection and devotion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And one other thing, politically, I don't think she ever lost a race. Can you imagine that? Time after time after time, they underestimated Ms. Carson, and Ms. Carson always came out on top.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an extraordinary privilege to know her and, at the end, to see the dignity of her suffering. I know they said of Pope John Paul II, they said, some of his finest moments was the dignity he showed in the suffering he went through. And we all saw it here at the House of Representatives, how hard she tried, how hard she struggled because she wanted to keep working hard for her beloved city. And it may well have been her most dignified, her most powerful moments were the struggles she went  through at the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to JULIA, we love you. We miss you, and I look forward to seeing you on Friday.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At this time I'd like to yield to the majority leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I met Andy Jacobs in the Young Democrats, many, many years ago. I drove Andy Jacobs to a speaking engagement at the Young Democrats at a restaurant not too far from the Baltimore Washington International Airport. A few years later I was elected to Congress, and Andy Jacobs was a Member of the Congress of the United States, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, an extraordinary Member of this House. And there came a time shortly thereafter when  Andy decided to retire. And there were a number of people who expressed an interest in running for this seat. Andy came to me and he said JULIA CARSON's going to win this race. You be for JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our beloved colleague, JOE DONNELLY has just said, she never lost a race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I didn't know JULIA CARSON. And there were some pretty active people, men and women, in that race; and we had met a couple of them. They were pretty impressive. I had not met JULIA CARSON. But Andy Jacobs, her predecessor, a Congressman for some 25 years, at least, said to me, JULIA CARSON's going to win this race. And sure enough, JULIA CARSON won the race. And those of us who served in this body had the privilege of getting to know JULIA CARSON, getting  to know her as a friend, getting to know her as a colleague, getting to know her as a leader in her community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I went to Indianapolis. I see my friend, my very, very close and dear friend Baron Hill here. Baron and I have been in Indianapolis a number of times, and I did a number of fund-raisers in Indianapolis for and with JULIA. And then in the last campaign I went out to Indianapolis to be with JULIA and we were at a senior citizens center, and it was the essence of JULIA CARSON. JULIA CARSON, who was sort of one of the most, "acerbic" is not the right word, I've been  searching for the right word, but JULIA could be very direct. And there was no fooling around. You knew where JULIA stood and you knew what she was thinking. She didn't have time for just jiving. She knew what she wanted to say, she knew what she wanted to do and she told you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I went to the senior center, and I spoke on her behalf. But so many people were speaking on her behalf. It was thought to be a tough campaign. She won better than she was expected to win. But you got the essence of JULIA CARSON as you went around and talked to those seniors who had been active in the community for many, many years, as JULIA had been, who worked herself up to be a Member of Congress, but she was not appointed by anybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community loved JULIA CARSON. And when I say the community, the community writ large, not the African American community, the white community, this community or that. The community, writ large, loved JULIA CARSON because she was honest, she was direct, she cared and she worked hard for her people. JULIA CARSON was an asset to her district, to Indianapolis, to Indiana, to this institution, the House of Representatives, and to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA CARSON is now back home in Indiana. We'll miss her. But this body was better for her service. And I thank the gentlelady for giving me this brief time to pay honor to a great woman and a great American.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>At this time I'd like to yield time to my colleague and good friend from California, DIANE WATSON.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'd like to thank STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES for providing this opportunity for us to remember someone that I considered a dear friend before I came to the House. I met JULIA in the 70s, and we bonded together because we were active in the National Conference of State Legislators, the Black Caucus. We were the two women in the Senate. And once you meet JULIA, you never forget her. She had that kind of impact on you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I remember her sitting up in the back with her head hanging very low. And she looked up and she saw, you know, I'd say, how are you feeling JULIA, and she'd say, oh, great. Well, you knew she wasn't feeling great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But she said, you know, I want to go on a codel. So I'm taking my own codel because no one here will take me with them. That was JULIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then I remember going out and she was standing against one of the pillars outside and hardly able to stand. I said, well, JULIA, let me stand with you. She said, no, I'm holding on. My staff is coming after me. She was the can-do-it person. And regardless how bad the time was, she never let you know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was the second one that went out with dignity and class and grace. And I knew that the time would not be long, because I called her office and I talked to her chief of staff; and when he said he was sitting at her bedside, I knew then that she wouldn't be back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I saw JULIA, like all of you did, as a leader, a crusader, a humanist. She understood racism and oppression, but she was never deterred by it. It only made her more of a leader, more of a crusader and more humanistic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former Congressman, Andy Jacobs relates in JULIA's official biography, and I quote the Congressman: "The only thing some people learn from oppression is hatred and revenge. Others learn compassion and empathy. From the physical pain of material poverty and the mindlessly cruel persecution of knee jerk racism, JULIA CARSON made her choice to be hard work, compassion and an engulfing sense of humor." It is therefore fitting that in 1996, JULIA CARSON took on the task  of seeking the Congressional Gold Medal for another pioneer in the struggle for human rights, Rosa Parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It took nearly 3 years, but JULIA did not go and she did not falter. In June of 1999, President Clinton signed into law Congresswoman JULIA CARSON's bill to authorize the Congressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks, and we all came to be part of that experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA CARSON, who could rightfully take her place in the company of Rosa Parks, was a woman of firsts. She was one of the first women of color to run for countywide office and then Statewide office. She was the first African American to represent Indianapolis in the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I salute this incredible life of service that JULIA gave to her city, her State and her country. She is a testament to a person who overcame many odds, who persevered and left a legacy on which others may proudly build.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rest well, JULIA. We know you're here, but we'll still miss you. God bless.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure at this  time to yield time to the Speaker of the House, the gentlelady from California, Nancy Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank very much my colleague and thank you for calling us together so that we can express our sympathy to the family of JULIA CARSON, to her constituents whom she loved and worked so hard for, and to our colleagues from Indiana; Mr. Visclosky, Mr. Hill and Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Ellsworth, who are here, this great distinguished delegation from Indiana with the crown jewel, JULIA CARSON, as one of the senior  members of the delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you so much. I know you are among those who were the last, certainly from Congress, to visit with Congresswoman &lt;/em&gt;&lt;b&gt;CARSON and conveyed back to us her usual good cheer and dignity and demeanor, and that is how she was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so that it's very sad to convey to her grandson Andre CARSON on behalf of all of the Members of the House of Representatives the deep sadness that we have over their suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members have talked about her in Congress and the kind of person that she was, and I remember visiting her on a number of occasions in Indianapolis, and what was a joy to behold was the esteem in which she was held by all of the people there, whether we were walking down the street or talking to police officers there. Wherever it was we went to events that she had, relating to health care, relating to the issues that concerned America's working families, people just worshipped JULIA CARSON.  I never saw anything like it. I never saw anything like it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She came to Congress, as has been mentioned, after decades of distinguished service to the State of Indiana, and Members have talked about her, the positions that she has held. During her time in the House, she was a very powerful advocate for the people of Indianapolis and for working families across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Indianapolis Star editorial board wrote, "The city's history-making congresswoman never forgot her roots."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was listening as Members talked about the role that she had played most recently, the congresswoman from California talking about the role she played in getting the House to vote for a Congressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked about how it was to watch JULIA in Indianapolis and just how people responded to her as she was walking down the street, and I now talk about how it was the day that she got this idea and started the ball rolling on this and then the day that Rosa Parks came to the Congress. It was a thrilling, historic day for all of us, the bond between the two of them, the reverence in which we all held Rosa Parks, and the appreciation that she had for the work that JULIA CARSON  had done to make that day possible, not only for Rosa Parks but for the country. She's a star. JULIA was a star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a fitting cause for her, as JULIA and Rosa Parks shared a quiet determination, a fierce sense of purpose and a total commitment to an ideal of equality which is our Nation's heritage and our Nation's hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, as we all know, in recent months, JULIA CARSON faced illness, but she did so with her characteristic courage and dignity. When she was here, she was here, and when she wasn't here, she was directing us from home. You were very fortunate, and I'm not usually jealous, but I'm jealous of the fact that you had an opportunity to see her. We had all hoped, of course, that we would see her once again here on the floor of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that we're reassured that JULIA is now at peace. This lovely, lovely woman, with an incredible sense of humor, she didn't miss anything that was going on on the floor. She would sit there quietly and then make the most incisive and insightful comments about the proceedings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're all sad to lose her as a congresswoman, of course, for our country. We're deeply saddened to lose her as a friend, and I hope it is a comfort to Andre CARSON and to her family and to her constituents that so many people throughout our country, and certainly in this Congress, share their grief and are praying for them at this sad time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank again my colleague for affording us the opportunity to express our admiration for this great lady, JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure at this time to yield time to another colleague from California, the gentlelady, MAXINE WATERS.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank the congresswoman from Ohio for initiating this memorial moment in the Congress of the United States for JULIA CARSON. This is a very special and important time because we're here this evening to talk about a woman that we truly loved and a woman who gave so much in public service to her country. I know that her family's saddened by her loss because it is a great loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has been referred to this evening as a jewel, as the queen, and I came to understand this quite some time ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've known JULIA for many years, long before I came to Congress and long before she came to Congress. I served in the State legislature of California, and she was a State legislator also, and like Diane Watson and others, we all worked with the Conference of State Legislators and the Conference of Black State Legislators. And so she knew legislators from all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And after I came here, I kept in contact with JULIA, and when she ran for office, she called me and she told me that she wanted me to help her. I thought she wanted me to raise some money or maybe come someplace to do something. And after talking with her for a few minutes, she made it very clear she wanted me to get Muhammad Ali to come to help her out. She didn't want me. She wanted Muhammad Ali, and so she said, Well, you know him, don't you? And I said, Yes, I do. She said, Well, if  I could get Muhammad Ali here, then that would seal the deal. That's exactly what I need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And of course, I asked him and he went to campaign with her, and he often asked after that how she was doing. And his award-winning photographer, Mr. Howard Binghan, would oftentimes ask me how she was doing, what she was doing so he could report to Muhammad Ali how his candidate that he had helped to win that election was doing in the Congress of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, let me just say, she was doing wonderfully well legislatively. Some people have referred to not only the fact that she was responsible for the recognition that Rosa Parks got getting the gold medal, but she was working on some tremendous legislation. And as I stand here before you this evening as the Chair of that Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, her legislation is really before us. It is known as HEARTH. It means the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition  to Housing Act. And, you know, we've got to pass that legislation, and we've got to pass it, that is, <bill type="h" number="840">H.R. 840</bill>, in the way that she wants it passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was expanding the definition of homelessness. She was expanding it so that more people, many of whom who were not considered homeless, we should be qualifying for homeless assistance, that did not get it, could now be drawn in with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, it is important for all of us to give support to the work that she was involved in because, again, this very special woman really did not suffer fools. I mean, I know that you've heard the story about the time she stepped on the elevator and another Member of Congress, who had not been here maybe quite as long as JULIA, said to JULIA when she stepped on the elevator, This elevator is for Members of Congress. And of course, she got the look that only JULIA can give, and  told somebody, Close the door, because that's how she handled someone who did not have the sense to be gracious enough to whomever was getting on the elevator, but certainly she should have known who her colleagues were getting on the elevator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are many stories you will hear about JULIA CARSON, because not only was she brilliant, she had this sense of humor and she had this wit that was just undeniable. And of all of the people who spoke at Rosa Parks' funeral, and I was at the funeral in Washington, D.C., when JULIA spoke, she was the most engaging, the most memorable, the one that really caught the attention of everyone at that service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA CARSON was truly a queen, and the descriptions that you've heard  about her this evening and how she was loved, you have to go to Indianapolis to understand it. You have to hear people talk about her to really get a sense of the queen, and they referred to her as "the queen."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I'm very proud to be a part of this discussion, remembering her this evening, and she will rest in peace, having done her part, having given all that any human being could give.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in her remarks during Rosa Parks' memorial service, Representative Carson said, I'm a sister from the hood and we know how to get things done. Well, from one sister to another sister I want to say, Thank you, JULIA CARSON, for your legacy of service, for your laughter and your love. I promise I will continue to work to get things done right here in the House, and I will remember all the things that you told me in the last conversations that we  had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But JULIA, I'm still trying to figure out who it was you said was going to invite me to dinner. I asked you that day I came to see you, and you still wouldn't tell me. So whoever it is, come on and invite me to dinner, because JULIA CARSON would want it to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank all of my colleagues for joining me in this wonderful hour of celebration for my colleague and good friend, JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember my friend and colleague, the Honorable JULIA CARSON.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone loved JULIA CARSON, especially we in the Congressional Black Caucus and the constituents in her district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had an opportunity to travel back to her district with her for a weekend health event, and I witnessed the deep affection and admiration that the people of Indianapolis--of all ages, races and walks of life--had for her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA had a way of telling a story that would have you rolling with laughter, even on serious or unpleasant things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was especially true when talking about herself. She was a regular at our health braintrust and she spoke of herself as being the "poster child" for health care and health disparities. Although at its core, it was no laughing matter, she had everyone in the audience cracking up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As sick as JULIA might have been, she never let it diminish her dedicated representation of her district and other work that needed to be done in Washington. And she walked to votes even in the last days that she was here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my honor--as it was for many Members--to assist her as she came to the Floor or a meeting. Years ago, I took it upon myself to call her office and suggest that her staff get her one of those motorized scooter-like vehicles that other Members have used off and on. Who told me to do that? I got a gentle tongue lashing from my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were many proud moments when we stood with JULIA and applauded her achievements, but none more so than the day that Rosa Parks was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor upon the passage of the Resolution she sponsored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JULIA did not even begin to get the kind of attention for her health that she needed until she was elected to Congress and by then her heart disease, mistaken for indigestion, was far gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, this humble lady who had health care deferred because of her race and gender, has flags at all Congressional buildings flying at half mast in her honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nation has lost a champion, the House has lost a valued and effective Member, minorities and the poor have lost an ardent advocate and I have lost a beloved colleague and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has gone to her eternal reward, and may she rest in peace.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to honor the life and career of the Honorable Congresswoman, JULIA CARSON, who was elected to Congress in 1996, and who died on December 15, 2007. Representative CARSON was a most respected friend and colleague of mine and also many other Members of Congress. The Honorable JULIA CARSON was from the Seventh Congressional District in Indiana. Ms. CARSON was a dedicated servant and worked tirelessly for the people of this  country and in particular she strongly advocated on behalf of those who were living in poverty or were homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The list of legislative efforts that Representative CARSON helped to create in this and in previous congressional terms spanned many issues and these legislative efforts are now a permanent part of the history of this Congress and of this county. In particular Representative CARSON gave her support for primary, secondary and college, education; and she believed in "single payer" health care, for all citizens of this country; she also believed in equal justice for all and lived  a life that reflected some of these fundamental values that were the hallmark of her service to this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman JULIA CARSON honored the legacy of the late Mrs. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks when she introduced legislation which came to fruition on March 4, 1999, when Mrs. Parks was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Representative CARSON also introduced legislation to have a commemorative postage stamp issued on behalf of Mrs. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative JULIA CARSON will always be remembered by her successful political career and will continue to make her indelible mark in history as a natural politician who steadily strengthened ties between people and who never forgot the community which she loved and served. People who worked with her in Congress will not forget the great sense of humor she would bring to them, when we all were experiencing long and arduous efforts that were often expended in the process of making  daily decisions on significant and lengthy congressional efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her continued efforts in Congress addressed the issues and supported legislation in the following areas: She was a staunch  advocate for equal rights for men and women. She demonstrated a sincere concern and fought for the relief and support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. In her wisdom, she advocated for many medical advances in veterans health care. Her continued outspoken support for the Second Chance Act of 2007, was well recognized. She spoke out for the support of the National Literacy act of 2007. In times of great suffering she stood tall and commemorated the Rutgers University women's basketball team  for their vigor in remaining proud of the skill that the team had achieved. She introduced a bill for establishing the celebrated National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. She honored the life of Arva Johnson, a pioneer in the United States Capitol Police Department, when she became the first African American female to wear the police badge. She supported the Horse Slaughter Protection Act. She recognized the 20 years of service of the world famous, Dr. James Hadley Billington, as Librarian of Congress. Congresswoman Carson supported the Paul Wellstone Mental</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my greatest sympathy to the family of Congresswoman Julia Carson on the loss of their mother, a warm and wonderful humanitarian who was an exceptional public figure and who has graciously served this country with her grace, wisdom and gentility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will all miss her.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400177" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Indiana lost one of its finest this weekend. I was deeply saddened to learn of Julia Carson's passing and my thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Julia for more than 20 years, and am a better person for it. She was a dear friend and her spirit will unarguably live on not only in the halls of Congress, but in the neighborhoods of Indianapolis where she touched the lives of so many. She had an enormous presence in Indianapolis and was always striving to help those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia embodied the true meaning of a "liberal"--a woman who was always fighting for those without a voice. She championed civil rights and walked alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., fighting for equality. She was to me, and so many others, a true hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julia was not only proud to be a Member of Congress and represent the fine people of Indianapolis, but she was constantly amazed at how far she had come. As many know, Julia had a difficult upbringing but only used those experiences to strengthen and shape her political views. Julia constantly reminded us all how fortunate we are to be Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss Julia very much. But, her spirit will live on for decades to come. She was a truly faithful person and took much comfort in that. I am so honored to have known Julia for so many years and to have worked so closely with her. She leaves behind a legacy of charity, service and an unwavering commitment to helping others.</paragraph>
