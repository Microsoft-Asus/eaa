    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is a rare opportunity to rise in support of commonsense decisions coming out of the other body, so it gives me great pleasure to rise in full support of the majority's decision on the other side of this Capitol to separate the Labor-HHS approps bill from legislation that funds our military installations and veterans health care. I certainly hope the majority on this side is paying attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the other body has said "no" to politicizing veterans health care, "no" to putting the security of our military installations at risk, and "no" to budget-busting pork, it appears that the majority on this side is, well, a little tone deaf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Madam Speaker, our veterans and men and women in uniform deserve better. They deserve quick action from the leadership in this House to pass a clean veterans bill and provide the funds they need. Let's leave the politics of disrespect behind. Let's pass a clean veterans bill.</paragraph>
