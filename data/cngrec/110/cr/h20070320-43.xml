  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been said that we will all be judged by how we treat the least among us. Nowhere is that more true than in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two international headlines tell us of the devastation that is now Iraq. The first: "Silent Victims: What Will Become of Iraq's Children?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the second: "World Ignoring Iraqi Refugees."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These headlines from CNN and the BBC, respectively, tell of the Iraqi victims of the occupation. While our brave men and women in uniform have done so much to try to improve the lives of average Iraqi families, the policies of the Bush administration have failed them and failed the Iraqi families in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recently released report from the U.N. found that nearly two million people have been displaced by the occupation of Iraq. Many of these refugees are seeking homes within Jordan and Syria. The report estimates that a quarter of these refugees are children, children who lack education opportunities and a normal, safe childhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems like the so-called mission is far from being accomplished. Iraqis are begging to leave Iraq's violence and instability. Thousands upon thousands of applications for residency in the United States have been denied, even for those who served alongside our troops as translators and as guides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four years ago the President promised an Iraq flourishing under a stable democracy. When children are afraid to go to school and parents are fearful of even taking a trip to the local market, President Bush's promise adds up to a total failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One child, a fourth grader, who was profiled in the CNN piece said: "They killed me father and uncle in front of my eyes." He was unable to continue because he broke down and he sobbed. This is the legacy that we are leaving for Iraq's future generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that our presence in Iraq is bringing more violence and more instability. Our presence may have given rise to a strong and deadly terrorist movement within the Iraqi civil war. Let's be honest. It is well past time to bring our troops home and let the Iraqi people regain their sovereignty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear: we must not withdraw our support of the Iraqi people. We should be investing in the political, fiscal, and social infrastructure of Iraq. We must help to provide for the most basic needs, including education, electricity, drinkable water, sanitation, and security. In the now famous words: "Mr. President, you broke it, you buy it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, it is time to bring our troops home. It is time to restore hope for the Iraqi people. It is the very least that we can do.</paragraph>
