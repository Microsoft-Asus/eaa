  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="TITLE II--PENSION PROVISIONS RELATING TO ECONOMIC CRISIS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of moving this bill, <bill type="h" number="7327">H.R. 7327</bill>, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, forward in an expedited manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Congress needs to provide pension funding relief rightaway before adjourning in order to prevent needless unemployment and unnecessary freezing of pension plans. We also need to help seniors who are forced to take funds out of retirement accounts that are much lower than balances at the end of last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is important to workers so that their retirement years will be more secure, and to employers so that the cost of the defined benefit pensions, which they are committed to offering their employees, will be more predictable. This bill also provided relief to retirees over age 70 and a half who are required to take a distribution from their IRA or 401(k).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Education and Labor Committee for bringing a bill to the floor that helps retirees, workers and pension plans cope with the unprecedented volatile investment environment while also including technical tax and ERISA provisions that give the added clarity retirement plans needed to comply with the Pension Protection Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also extend thanks to the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Education and Labor Committee and their counterparts in the Senate. Their hard work brings us to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that we act now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Facing the most severe recession in decades, U.S. companies will need to plan a careful business strategy and keep a firm control on expenses. According to a survey of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), pension costs have become a major concern in this fiscal environment as sizeable increases in pension funding requirements due to the significant market declines will make an economic recovery more challenging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill takes important steps to help corporations remain committed to providing retirement promises to workers through defined benefit plans. In addition, the bill includes similar critical relief for multi-employers' pension plans that cover union workers at many smaller employers especially those in construction industry. At the same time if workers are covered in a plan and its funding level falls below a level at which benefit restrictions would apply the bill allows those plans to look  at their 2008 funding level and protect workers from a mandated frozen pension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not want to put employers in a no win pinch when they would have to choose between providing pensions or keeping employees on their jobs. Our Nation's pension plan is a voluntary system and employers can decide that offering a pension simply no longer makes good business sense. Tonight Congress tells employers we understand that and we want to help you meet your pension obligations in a predictable way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those retirees who must take a distribution from their IRA or 401(k) account that today has a dramatically lower value than the account at the end of last year, the bill will allow them to not take such distributions in 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, just let me say that American workers are anxious about their retirement security. Today, the House of Representatives is acting to address and to reduce this uneasiness. It is a very important bill, and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
