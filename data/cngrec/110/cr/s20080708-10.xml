    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think Senators Cornyn and Durbin wish to speak. So after the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Connecticut finish speaking, if we could--I would suggest that we give them the remaining time on morning business until 11:30. I ask unanimous consent to establish morning business until 11:30.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very heart warmed that this concept is giving us the opportunity to talk about these magnificent documents. I was fortunate at one time to be designated by the President and actually confirmed by the Senate in a position for the Nation's bicentennial to lead discussions all across America in all 50 States--and indeed I traveled to 22 foreign countries--working on the concept of America's bicentennial and of the magnificence of the Constitution, the Declaration  of Independence, and the Bill of Rights. I remember so well when talking to audiences the rapt attention that was given at that period in our history about the importance of these documents. Not one, not two--I don't know how many people would say to me that they felt the hand of divine providence came down and rested upon the shoulders of the Founding Fathers to put together such a magnificent framework of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That framework of government today stands as the longest and oldest surviving form of a democratic republic on Earth. It is something to think about. All the other forms of government--monarchies and so forth--have either been changed or have gone into the dust bin of history but not ours. It is because of the genius of these individuals that enables us to carry forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember I was challenged one time that Switzerland's Government was continuous. I reminded them that Napoleon crossed the Alps, I think it was in--and I will check it and correct it for the record--in about 1827 and annexed Switzerland to France. That persisted for some 18 months, and then Napoleon decided it was too cold over there, didn't want it, and cut it loose and let it go. I will polish that history later on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we should focus on the magnificence of this document, its endurance, and that we are proudly the trustees of this framework of government, to make it work as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. We recognize that with the passage of time, there are things that have overtaken some of the original--not their basic concepts, but just the electronic world in which we live now, the instantaneous information world and all of those things have contributed. Nevertheless, we are the oldest surviving  democratic republic on Earth today because of the magnificent work of the Founding Fathers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Warner for those very eloquent words. I can't think of a better way to end this celebration of the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson of Virginia than with the words of the great Senator from Virginia today, John Warner. I appreciate all of the Members of the Senate having participated in this celebration of our founding documents and of the principles that have given America its purpose and destiny over  these many decades. Of course, we hope this will serve in its way as a teaching instrument, a civics  lesson for those around the country who may be listening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For our own part here in the Senate, let's pledge today to uphold these principles and their values and the eloquence with which they were expressed, with the same dedication and persistence in courage as the great first generation of Americans who wrote them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time between now and 11:30 is equally divided between myself and a Senator on the Republican side?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> That is not part of the unanimous consent agreement.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Is there any pending unanimous consent or any pending consent relative to the time?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Only that morning business continue until 11:30.</chair>

    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes--well, let me just make that request, that the remaining time between now and 11:30 be equally divided between the Democratic side and the Republican side and that I be allocated the Democratic time.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
