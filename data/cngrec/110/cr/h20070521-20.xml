    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2078">H.R. 2078</bill>, which names the postal facility in Cherry Fork, Ohio, after Omer T. "O.T." Hawkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2078">H.R. 2078</bill> was introduced by Representative Jean Schmidt on April 30, 2007, and was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007, by voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 16 Members, has the support of the entire Ohio congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Omer T., better known as "O.T.," Hawkins, died on Thursday, October 14, 2004, in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb. He was assigned to the 44th Engineer Battalion based in Camp Howze, Korea. His Army colleagues have described him as "a tremendous warrior coupled with compassion" and said that "his skill as a superb non-commissioned officer who could influence any soldier defined his life and the principles he defended."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Hawkins graduated from North Adams High School on a Friday in 1991, and that following Monday he enlisted in the Army. Miss Cherry Frederick, his sister, said, and I quote, "The only thing that he ever wanted to do was go into the military." Family and friends will forever remember Staff Sergeant Hawkins' dedication and service to his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Schmidt from Ohio, for introducing this legislation. I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to a remarkable soldier and another true American hero. On October 14, 2004, SSGT Omer "O.T." Hawkins from Cherry Fork, Ohio, gave his life in service to our Nation. He was killed when his convoy hit a roadside bomb outside Ar Ramadi, Iraq. O.T. was only 31 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on November 29, 1972, O.T. always knew that he wanted to join the Army. When he was only 10 years old, O.T. wrote a letter to the Army asking if he could sign up despite his being so young. At North Adams High School, O.T. showed his leadership while participating in many school activities. He was a member of the Academic Team, played baseball and was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" by his senior class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After high school he could have pursued just about any career, yet the military remained his number one love and lifelong goal. Only 2 days after his high school graduation, and 8 years after he wrote that priceless letter to the Army expressing his desire to join, he reported to basic training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>O.T. was not only following his personal dream, he was following in the footsteps of his father who served proudly as an engineer in the Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once in the Army, O.T. quickly developed a leadership style armed with an arsenal of wit and knowledge, a perfect combination that was recognized by his comrades and superiors. Having served on tours of duty in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Egypt, Kosovo and Somalia, O.T. was a deeply respected and beloved leader. His colleagues have described him, as "a stunning leader and a great man," and said that "his aura always gave great hope to his soldiers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>O.T. loved this country more than anything else and was proud to serve in the protection of its citizens. Friends and family will forever remember O.T.'s dedication to the cause of freedom and his commitment to bringing that cherished freedom to people around the world where he served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with gratitude for his bravery and sacrifice and for the sacrifice of those who loved him that I ask all Members to join me in naming the Cherry Fork, Ohio, postal facility in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2078">H.R. 2078</bill>, legislation to name the United States Postal Facility in Cherry Fork, Ohio, as the "Staff Sergeant Omer T. `O.T.' Hawkins Post Office." I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation to honor an American hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on November 29, 1972, O.T. always knew he wanted to be a soldier; and at the age of 10 he actually wrote the Army requesting that he become a member of the Army. In high school, he was a member of the academic team and was voted "Most Likely to Succeed." Instead of going to college or taking another career path, just shortly after graduation he joined the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Army, O.T. quickly developed a leadership style armed with an arsenal of wit and knowledge that was admired by all who served with him. His deployments took him across the globe, including Desert Storm, Somalia, Haiti, Egypt twice, Bosnia, and Kosovo. His colleagues described him as a tremendous soldier, someone who loved his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Army SSGT Omer O.T. Hawkins died on Thursday, October 14, 2004, in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, when his convoy was hit by a roadside bomb. His letter as an innocent young boy illustrates the lifelong desire O.T. had to serve his country and why I am humbled to sponsor this bill honoring him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He believed in what he did, and his last message was:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I will continue to fight when others falter and grow weary of their duty. I firmly believe in the Constitution. In fact, I believe it applies to all humanity, not just America."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to share a poem written by O.T.'s nephew Joshua for his funeral:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"A soldier isn't judged by how good his aim is or how many bullets he's used. He isn't judged by how many lives he's taken or how many ribbons decorate his uniform. He won't be judged by how many wars he's fought or enemies he's made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"A soldier is judged by how many flags hang for him and how many yellow ribbons decorate cars for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I know my Uncle O.T. is above us smiling because he knows that in 20 years people won't remember how many medals he received but how hard he fought for his country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please help ensure that future generations of SSGT O.T. Hawkins' family, friends, and neighbors in Cherry Fork, Ohio, never forget how hard he fought for his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please support <bill type="h" number="2078">H.R. 2078</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Just to close, let me just indicate there are heroes and sheroes all around us. Many of them are indeed giants who give of themselves in such a way that others pay little note to. And so when we take the time to name a Federal installation after a soldier who gave his or her life, in essence we are taking some of the dirt from around, taking the person out of the hole, and elevating them to the status of giant that they really are and have been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I commend my colleague from Ohio for introducing this legislation, and I urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="2078">H.R. 2078</bill>.</chair>
